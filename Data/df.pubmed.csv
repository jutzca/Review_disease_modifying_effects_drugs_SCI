Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal cord contusion at the T8-T9 level by the weight drop method producing permanent paraplegia. Oral paracetamol bioavailability after administration of a single 100 mgkg-1 dose was determined 1, 12, and 50 d after SCI. Cmax and AUC were significantly decreased 1 d after SCI compared to sham-injured controls. This reduction, however, was temporary, as there was a recovery of bioavailability parameters which was partial 12 d after SCI, being complete by day 50. The present results confirm the usefulness of animal models for the characterization of the effect of SCI in drug kinetics. Data show that SCI induces significant changes in paracetamol pharmacokinetics. Nonetheless, despite the fact of a permanent loss of functions related to locomotion, pharmacokinetic alterations evolved with time.","acetaminophen","pubmed"

Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the most commonly used drug for Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients that exerts an immunomodulatory effect against Myelin basic protein (MBP) antigen. Materials and methods: High-dose (2mg/kg) treatment of GA for 28 consecutive days after SCI was compared with its low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) treatment, SCI control and Sham control rat groups. Results: High-dose GA group had significantly worsened outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control and low-dose GA groups, which was confirmed by augmented spinal cavity volume and reduced ventral horn motor neurons in high-dose GA group; however, there was no significant difference between low-dose GA and control SCI group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that high-dose GA injection has more significant effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to low-dose GA and control SCI groups, which was associated with significant increase in IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17A secretion. Conclusion: Along with confirmation of deleterious aspects of autoimmunity resulting from autoreactive lymphocytes against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that high-dose immunotherapy using GA, especially in acute phase after SCI, overwhelms any neuroprotective effect of adoptive immune system.","acetate","pubmed"

The aim of this study was to establish whether treatment with LA improves sensitivity, motor activity and independence in patients with chronic SCI. Patients were treated LA once a month for six months. They were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of treatment; using a sensitivity and motor impairment scale, according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), and grade of independence scale; employing the spinal cord independence measure (SCIM). Statistical analysis showed a significant improvement in the ASIA sensory score and the SCIM score when comparing the initial versus final evaluation after six months of LA administration. Some patients showed an increase in frequency of bowel movements. Treatment with LA induces improvements in sensitivity, motor activity and independence in patients with chronic SCI. One advantage of this protocol is that it is a non-invasive method of easy and safe application, with few side effects.","acetate","pubmed"

Rats with spinal cord compression injury were administered leuprolide acetate or saline solution for 5 weeks. At the 5(th) week, leuprolide acetate-treated rats showed locomotor activity recovery by 38%, had improvement in kinematic gait and exhibited voiding reflex recovery by 60%, as compared with the 1(st) week. By contrast, saline solution-treated rats showed locomotor activity recovery only by 7%, but voiding reflex did not recover. More importantly, leuprolide acetate treatment reduced microglial immunological reaction and induced a trend towards greater area of white and gray matter in the spinal cord. Therefore, leuprolide acetate has great potential to repair spinal cord injury.","acetate","pubmed"

However, whether these cells play a beneficial or detrimental role is still a matter of debate. Although some studies showed that MBP-T cells are mainly helper T (Th) cells, their subtypes are still not very clear. One possible explanation for MBP-T immunization leading to conflicting results may be the different subtypes of T cells are responsible for distinct effects. In this study, the Th1 and Th2 type MBP-T cells (MBP-Th1 and -Th2) were polarized in vitro, and their effects on the local immune microenvironment and tissue repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) after adoptive immunization were investigated. In MBP-Th1 cell transferred rats, the high levels of pro-inflammatory cells (Th1 cells and M1 macrophages) and cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, -β, IL-1β) were detected in the injured spinal cord; however, the anti-inflammatory cells (Th2 cells, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages) and cytokines (IL-4, -10, and -13) were found in MBP-Th2 cell transferred animals. MBP-Th2 cell transfer resulted in decreased lesion volume, increased myelination of axons, and preservation of neurons. This was accompanied by significant locomotor improvement. These results indicate that MBP-Th2 adoptive transfer has beneficial effects on the injured spinal cord, in which the increased number of Th2 cells may alter the local microenvironment from one primarily populated by Th1 and M1 cells to another dominated by Th2, Treg, and M2 cells and is conducive for SCI repair.","acetate","pubmed"

Such a treatment may serve to: I) provide trophic support to improve survival of host neurons; II) improve the structural integrity of the spinal parenchyma by reducing syringomyelia and scarring in trauma-injured regions; and III) provide neuronal populations to potentially form relays with host axons, segmental interneurons, and/or α-motoneurons. Here we characterized the effect of intraspinal grafting of clinical grade human fetal spinal cord-derived neural stem cells (HSSC) on the recovery of neurological function in a rat model of acute lumbar (L3) compression injury. Three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received L3 spinal compression injury. Three days post-injury, animals were randomized and received intraspinal injections of either HSSC, media-only, or no injections. All animals were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone acetate from the day of cell grafting and survived for eight weeks. Motor and sensory dysfunction were periodically assessed using open field locomotion scoring, thermal/tactile pain/escape thresholds and myogenic motor evoked potentials. The presence of spasticity was measured by gastrocnemius muscle resistance and electromyography response during computer-controlled ankle rotation. At the end-point, gait (CatWalk), ladder climbing, and single frame analyses were also assessed. Syrinx size, spinal cord dimensions, and extent of scarring were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Differentiation and integration of grafted cells in the host tissue were validated with immunofluorescence staining using human-specific antibodies. Intraspinal grafting of HSSC led to a progressive and significant improvement in lower extremity paw placement, amelioration of spasticity, and normalization in thermal and tactile pain/escape thresholds at eight weeks post-grafting. No significant differences were detected in other CatWalk parameters, motor evoked potentials, open field locomotor (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotion score (BBB)) score or ladder climbing test. Magnetic resonance imaging volume reconstruction and immunofluorescence analysis of grafted cell survival showed near complete injury-cavity-filling by grafted cells and development of putative GABA-ergic synapses between grafted and host neurons. Peri-acute intraspinal grafting of HSSC can represent an effective therapy which ameliorates motor and sensory deficits after traumatic spinal cord injury.","acetate","pubmed"

To evaluate the efficacy and active components of a previously described epidural analgesic paste in controlling postoperative pain and facilitating early discharge from hospital after lumbar decompressive surgery. A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted. Two-hundred and one patients were randomized to 1 of 4 analgesic epidural pastes at the time of lumbar spinal surgery: combination paste (morphine + methylprednisolone), steroid paste (methylprednisolone alone), morphine paste (morphine alone), or placebo. The primary outcome measures used were analgesic consumption and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Secondary outcome measures were: modified American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) score, Short Form 36 General Health Survey (SF-36), Aberdeen Pain Index (ABPI), time to ambulation and time to discharge from hospital. Administration of combination and steroid paste, but not morphine paste, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI) components of the MPQ in the first 3 days after surgery. Likewise, postoperative in-patient narcotic analgesic consumption was reduced in the combination paste and steroid paste group, but not in the morphine paste group. No difference in time to ambulation or discharge, SF-36 scores, ABPI scores, or neurologic recovery was observed. An analgesic paste containing methylprednisolone acetate is effective at reducing postoperative pain after lumbar decompressive surgery. Mixing effective doses of morphine sulfate in the paste abrogates the expected analgesic effects of epidural morphine.","acetate","pubmed"

Nitric oxide (NO) functions as a retrograde neurotransmitter in the spinal cord, and postsynaptic structures respond to NO by producing cGMP. The concentrations of cGMP in the spinal cord are controlled by the actions of PDE. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the effects of the use of both methylprednisolone and tadalafil on serum and tissue concentrations of NO, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and tissue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in Wistar albino rats by dropping a 10 g rod from a 5.0 cm height at T8-10. The 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: tadalafil, methylprednisolone, non-treatment and sham groups. Rats were neurologically tested at 24 hours after trauma. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p<0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p<0.05). The increase in serum SOD levels was greater in the tadalafil group than the methylprednisolone group. Serum MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group (p>0.05). Tissue MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group and sham groups (p>0.05). Although there was no difference in neurological outcome scores between the tadalafil, methylprednisolone and non-treatment groups (p>0.05), the animals in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to have better scores than the non-treatment group. Thus, tadalafil appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of injury to the spinal cord by increasing tissue levels of NO and serum activity of SOD.","acetate","pubmed"

Guanabenz acetate was administered twice daily for 8 weeks. In the first group, the treatment significantly increased blood flow in the abdominal aorta. All cats treated with guanabenz acetate 3 hr after spinal cord contusion had return of micturition and none suffered complete paraplegia. Four animals had partial and the other four had complete motor recovery. A superoxide (O2-.) generating system, horseradish peroxidase, decreased [14C]gamma amino butyric acid uptake by mouse cortical slices by 33% but when superoxide dismutase was added to the medium, the uptake was reduced by only 9%. The nerve endings were also protected by superoxide dismutase from morphologic damage by O2-. as observed by electron microscopy. The agents used in these studies produce their ameliorating effects by virtue of their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and membrane stabilizing properties, and enhancing the regional microcirculation. In addition to having these properties, guanabenz acetate is also an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist.","acetate","pubmed"

Although these membrane lipid disturbances are thought to contribute to the paralysis that occur subsequent to spinal cord injury, such a correlation has not been demonstrated directly. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to test the capacity of alpha tocopherol, the major lipid antioxidant in cellular membranes and a compound that limits the injury-induced lipid hydrolysis and peroxidation in spinal cord tissue, to promote functional recovery in a static loading model of spinal cord injury. After laminectomy, the L2 spinal cord of cats was compressed with 180 g for 5 min. For 5 days before injury and for 5 days postinjury, treated cats received orally 1000 IUD-alpha tocopherol acetate daily. Control cats were similarly injured but untreated. All cats were blindly evaluated weekly for 4 weeks for their neurologic recovery based on an 11 point behavioral scale that assessed walking, running, and stair climbing. By the second postinjury week, alpha tocopherol-pretreated cats demonstrated significantly better recovery than untreated controls. By 4 weeks, treated cats had recovered 72% of their preinjury function as compared with 20% for untreated controls, i.e., a 3.5-fold difference. These results strongly suggest that lipid peroxidation and/or hydrolysis is primarily involved in the genesis of posttraumatic paralysis and that alpha tocopherol exerts its protection of injured spinal cord tissue, at least in part, by its antioxidant and/or antilipolytic activity.","acetate","pubmed"

To isolate the analgesic fraction from the venom, evaluate the profile of its action on pain using preclinical nociceptive tests and determine the involvement of neurotransmitters in its action. Venom was separated with SPXL resin, and further purified by Superdex 75 and Superdex 30 resin. Its biochemical characteristics were analyzed including molecular weight (MW), isoelectric point (pI) and amino acid sequence. Animal pain models were applied including the hot plate test, acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin test, Randall-Selitto pressure test, antagonistic test, spinalized rats test and intracerebral injection test. The endogenous neuropeptides leucine-enkephalin, β-endorphin and P substance were determined by HPLC in the tissues of brain and spinal cord. An analgesic protein named pallanalgesin (MW 16.6 kDa, pI 8.8) was obtained from the venom of A. halys. It had significant antinociceptive activity in different animal pain models of thermal, chemical and mechanical stimulation. It effects both central and peripheral nerve systems, and it is related to opiate receptors and monoamines rather than acetylcholine receptors. Pallanalgesin could modulate the levels of neuropeptides in the brain and spinal cord, which contributes to the recovery of nerve injury and pain control. As a novel analgesic, pallanalgesin has been found to explain the function of the venom of A. halys on severe pain control in traditional uses, and can be used as a new analgesic in the future.","acetic_acid","pubmed"

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of PPAR-beta/delta in the secondary damage in experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. To this purpose, we used 4-[[[2-[3-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-methyl-5-thiazolyl]methyl]thio]-2-methylphenoxy]acetic acid (GW0742), a high-affinity PPAR-beta/delta agonist. Spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5 to T8 laminectomy. SCI in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, production of inflammatory mediators, tissue damage, and apoptosis. GW0742 treatment (0.3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) 1 and 6 h after the SCI significantly reduced 1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), 2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), 3) nitrotyrosine formation, 4) proinflammatory cytokines expression, 5) nuclear factor-kappaB activation, 6) inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, and 6) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining, FasL, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, GW0742 significantly ameliorated the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of GW0742 are related to activation of the PPAR-beta/delta receptor, we also investigated the effect of PPAR-beta/delta antagonist methyl 3-({[2-(methoxy)-4 phenyl]amino}sulfonyl)-2-thiophenecarboxylate (GSK0660) on the protective effects of GW0742. GSK0660 (1 mg/kg i.p. 30 min before treatment with GW0742) significantly blocked the effect of the PPAR-beta/delta agonist and thus abolished the protective effect. Our results clearly demonstrate that GW0742 treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma.","acetic_acid","pubmed"

Gradient-recalled fast T2-weighted imaging is advocated for evaluating cervical radiculopathy. Better signal-to-noise ratios are achieved with three-dimensional Fourier transform gradient-recalled T2-weighted imaging and with decreased bandwidth acquisition. Obtaining high-contrast images of the spine is often complicated by the appearance of truncation artifacts. In outpatient radiculography, both iopamidol and iohexol appear safe, but iohexol seems better tolerated. In trauma, MR imaging is definitive, and signal abnormalities can help in evaluating neurologic recovery. Intraoperative spinal sonography may be helpful in evaluating acute injury. Enhancement with gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid is useful in the evaluation of disk space infections, osteomyelitis, and epidural abscess and in the study of spinal cord sarcoidosis. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, MR imaging may show hyperintense spine on T2-weighted images. MR imaging with gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid or gadolinium tetra-azacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid enhancement can be useful in evaluating intramedullary and intradural extramedullary tumors and for determining the extent of spinal leptomeningeal metastases.

Rats with either type of 5,7-DHT lesions displayed supersensitive behavioral responses to 5-HTP. However, rats lesioned by i.p. injections exhibited significantly greater shaking behavior (+1445%) in response to 5-HTP than their i.c. counterparts, who instead showed more forepaw myoclonus (+250%) and head weaving (+270%), the core features of the 5-HT syndrome. Differences in 5-HT syndrome behaviors were already present 2 weeks after lesioning, whereas the difference in shaking behavior was not. After 14 weeks, 5-HT was selectively depleted (-43 to -92%) in hippocampus, spinal cord, and frontal cortex, and differences between i.c. and i.p. 5,7-DHT routes were insignificant except in frontal cortex. Brainstem 5-HT concentrations were significantly increased (+35%) after i.p. 5,7-DHT injections in contrast to reduction (-89%) after i.c. 5,7-DHT; 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HIAA/5-HT) ratios were decreased (-20%) with either route. These data suggest that brainstem 5-HT hyperinnervation following i.p. 5,7-DHT injection modifies the functional consequences of injury in abating the 5-HT syndrome, but does not result in complete recovery since shaking behavior is enhanced. Loss of presynaptically mediated autoregulation or receptor dysregulation may play a major role in behavioral supersensitivity induced by 5-HTP in rats with 5,7-DHT lesions. To the extent that the 5-HT syndrome is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors and shaking behavior by 5-HT2 sites, differential responses to injury of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to these behavioral differences.","acetic_acid","pubmed"

The sciatic functional index (SFI) was also measured to assess the functional recovery post-nerve lesion. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided equally into the following groups: Naive (rats did not undergo surgical manipulation); Sham (rats in which all surgical procedures involved in CCI were used except the ligature), and CCI (rats in which four ligatures were tied loosely around the right common sciatic nerve), which received 2, 4, or 8 intraperitoneal injections of NAC (150 mg·kg-1·day-1) or saline beginning 4 h after CCI.

CCI induced a decrease in SFI as well as an increase in p-p38 expression and SAG in the spinal cord. The SFI showed a partial recovery at day 7 in saline-treated CCI rats, but recovery was improved in NAC-treated CCI rats. NAC induced a downregulation in p-p38 expression at all time-points evaluated, but did not reverse the increased SAG induced by CCI. Since p-p38 is a mediator in neuropathic pain and/or nerve regeneration, modulation of this protein may play a role in NAC-induced effects in CCI rats.","acetylcysteine","pubmed"

In this study, using nerve growth factor-differentiated neuronal-like Neuroscreen-1 cells, we show that extremely low concentrations of unfractionated green tea polyphenol mixture (GTPP) and its active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), prevent both the neurite outgrowth-inhibiting activity and growth cone-collapsing activity of Nogo-66 (C-terminal domain of Nogo-A). Furthermore, a synergistic interaction was observed among GTPP constituents. This preventive effect was dependent on 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) to which EGCG binds with high affinity. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and cell-permeable catalase abolished this preventive effect of GTPP and EGCG, suggesting the involvement of sublethal levels of H2 O2 in this process. Accordingly, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H2 O2 , added as a bolus dose (5 μM) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1-2 μM), mimicked GTPP in counteracting the action of Nogo-66. Exogenous H2 O2 mediated this action by bypassing the requirement of 67LR. Taken together, these results show for the first time that GTPP and EGCG, acting through 67LR and elevating intracellular sublethal levels of H2 O2 , inhibit the antineuritogenic action of Nogo-A. Currently, several agents are being evaluated for overcoming axonal growth inhibitors to promote functional recovery after stroke and spinal cord injury. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), present in green tea polyphenol mixture (GTPP), prevents antineuritogenic activity of Nogo-A, a myelin-derived axonal growth inhibitor. The preventive action of EGCG involves the cell-surface-associated 67-kDa laminin receptor and H2 O2 . GTPP may complement ongoing efforts to treat neuronal injuries.>","acetylcysteine","pubmed"

The amide form of N-acetylcysteine (NACA) overcomes these limitations while maintaining a high antioxidant potential, and shows promise for combating secondary pathogenesis attributed to oxidative stress. Neurotrauma precipitates a rapid and prolonged disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics, whereby the production of reactive oxygen species overwhelms the endogenous antioxidant capacity of the cells. Two noteworthy papers from collaborative teams have recently been published in Experimental Neurology, in which NACA was applied to rodent models of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, respectively. Using sensitive methods to measure respiratory rates in isolated mitochondrial populations, treatment with NACA was shown to maintain mitochondrial function and boost antioxidant reserves, which corresponded with improvements in structural and functional outcomes in both studies. This commentary aims to highlight key findings from this research in a broader context, with an emphasis on methodological advances, future research possibilities, and potential applicability to brain and/or spinal cord injured patients.","acetylcysteine","pubmed"

The present study investigates the neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) on sensory DRG neurons and spinal motoneurons after sciatic axotomy and nerve grafting in adult rats. Sciatic axotomy and nerve grafting were performed at 1 week after sural DRG neurons and motoneurons were retrogradely labeled with the fluorescent tracer Fast Blue. To assess the efficacy of axonal regeneration, a second fluorescent dye Fluoro-Ruby was applied distal to the graft at 12 weeks after nerve repair. At 8-13 weeks after axotomy, only 52-56% of the sural sensory neurons remained in the lumbar DRG, while the majority of motoneurons survived the sciatic nerve injury. Nerve grafting alone or continuous intrathecal NAC treatment (2.4 mg/day) improved survival of sural DRG neurons. Combined treatment with nerve graft and NAC had significant additive effect on neuronal survival and also increased the number of sensory neurons regenerating across the graft. However, NAC treatment neither affected the number of regenerating motoneurons nor the number of myelinated axons in the nerve graft or in the distal nerve stump. The present results demonstrate that NAC provides a highly significant effect of neuroprotection in an animal nerve injury model and that combination with nerve grafting further attenuates retrograde cell death and promotes regeneration of sensory neurons.","acetylcysteine","pubmed"

Even effective anti-viral or bacterial agents often fail to eliminate or inhibit the infection, as these drugs may also fail to reach the most painful area where often unrecognizable circulatory disturbances co-exist. Using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification Method, we were able to localize substance P and thromboxane B2 (a good indicator of the presence and degree of circulatory disturbances) in the painful area along with virus or bacteria. Based on the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test localization method for specific substances or microbes, the author has successfully treated cases of chronic intractable pain by the combination of anti-viral or bacterial agents with either manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture or transcutaneous electrical stimulation through a pair of surface electrodes. Among a variety of infections, the most common cause of severe intractable pain was herpes simplex virus, and the most common bacterial cause of intractable pain of moderate degree was campylobacter. In addition, chlamydia was a very common cause of mild intractable pain. When peripheral nerve fibers are hypersensitive from nerve injury due to viral infection, in addition to the drug therapy for infection, use of Vitamin B1 25 mg., 2 times a day for an average adult often accelerates recovery time. As an anti-viral agent for the herpes virus family, the author found that EPA (Omega 3 fish oil, Eicosa Pentaenoic Acid, C20:5 omega 3), at doses between 180 mg. and 350 mg (depending upon body weight) 4 times a day for 2 to 6 weeks, without prescribing the common anti-viral agent Acyclovir, often eliminated the symptoms due to viral infection including all well-known types of the herpes virus, such as herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are usually not associated with intractable severe pain, but they are often associated with a recurrent burning or itching sensation and they can cause intractable frequent muscle twitching. Viruses belonging to the herpes family almost always exist between the midline of one side of the spinal cord and the midline of the front of the body where these nerves from the spinal cord end and the same virus is localized only on one side of the body at the same spinal level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","acyclovir","pubmed"

In the current study, we used a HO-1-encoding lentivirus to transduce microglia, and adoptively transferred these microglia into injured rat spinal cords. Lentivirus-induced overexpression of exogenous HO-1 significantly inhibited microglia-mediated inflammatory response after SCI, as demonstrated by lower expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in transferred microglia. In addition, the overall post-SCI neuroinflammation was also suppressed by HO-1-overexpressing microglia, as indicated by less leukocyte infiltration and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the spinal cord. Consistently, the tissue damage and neuronal apoptosis were decreased in injured spinal cords, while the locomotor function was moderately improved. We further identified that adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling was involved in the regulatory effect of HO-1 on microglia, because HO-1 overexpression increased the activating phosphorylation of AMPKα. Moreover, the AMPK inhibitor compound C diminished the anti-inflammatory effect of HO-1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia in vitro.

However, both preclinical and clinical studies indicate the capacity of electrical and pharmacological interventions to synergistically increase the engagement of spinal sensorimotor networks and regain motor function after SCI. This study explored whether selective pharmacological antagonism of the adenosine A1 receptor subtype synergizes with ESS, thereby increasing motor response. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological antagonism of A1 receptors during ESS would produce facilitatory effects in spinal sensorimotor networks detected as an increased amplitude of spinally-evoked motor potentials and sustained duration of ESS induced activity. Terminal experiments were performed in adult rats using trains of stereotyped pulses at 40 Hz delivered at L5 with the local administration to the cord of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). We demonstrated that ESS combined with the blockage of A1 receptors increased the magnitude of the endogenous modulation and postponed the decay of responses that occur during ESS alone. Although DPCPX significantly increased the yield of repetitive stimulation in intact spinal cords, the effects of A1 antagonism on motor evoked responses after an acute spinal transection was not detected. These studies support the future investigation of the optimal dosage, methods of delivery, and systemic effects of the synergistic application of A1 antagonists and spinal stimulation in the intact and injured spinal cord.","adenosine","pubmed"

To investigate its therapeutic function and molecular mechanism in SCI, transcriptome analysis associated with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out at various time points after T9 crush injury. 2-MesADP demonstrated recovery of limb motor function at the 6 weeks after injury, accompanied by neuronal regeneration and axon remyelination at 2 and 6 weeks.

Loss of mitochondrial homeostasis after SCI, mediated primarily by oxidative stress, is considered to play a crucial role in the proliferation of secondary injury cascade. We hypothesized that effective exogenous delivery of antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), encapsulated in biodegradable nanoparticles (nano-SOD/CAT) - at the lesion site would protect mitochondria from oxidative stress, and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury. Previously, in a rat contusion model of severe SCI, we demonstrated extravasation and retention of intravenously administered nanoparticles specifically at the lesion site. To test our hypothesis, a single dose of nano-SOD/CAT in saline was administered intravenously 6 h post-injury, and the spinal cords were analyzed one week post-treatment. Mitochondria isolated from the affected region of the spinal cord of nano-SOD/CAT-treated animals demonstrated significantly reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced calcium levels, and also higher adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production capacity than those isolated from the spinal cords of untreated control or SOD/CAT solution treated animals. Although the treatment did not achieve the same mitochondrial function as in the spinal cords of sham control animals, it significantly attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction following SCI. Further, immunohistochemical analyses of the spinal cords of treated animals showed significantly lower ROS, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c activities, leading to reduced spinal cord neuronal cell apoptosis and smaller lesion area than in untreated animals. These results imply that the treatment significantly attenuated progression of secondary injury that was also reflected from less weight loss and improved locomotive recovery of treated vs. untreated animals. In conclusion, nano-SOD/CAT mitigated activation of cascade of degenerating factors by protecting mitochondria and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury. An effective treatment during the acute phase following SCI could potentially have a positive long-term impact on neurological and functional recovery.","adenosine","pubmed"

Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to look into the therapeutic effects of ECH on SCI and the underlying mechanisms. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, Nissl staining, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to examine the therapeutic effects of ECH on SCI. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in BV-2 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and adenosine 5'-triphosphate were examined. The expression levels of proteins involving NLRP3 inflammasome-related pathway were measured. The in vivo experiment indicated that administration of ECH significantly enhanced the BBB scores, reduced the neuron loss, and ameliorated the tissue architecture after SCI. Additionally, ECH dramatically inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the rat SCI model. In vitro study indicated that ECH significantly reduced ROS level, improved the MMP, blocked activation of NF-κB, and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. The effect of ECH on inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway was partially governed by suppression of the generation of ROS and activation of NF-κB.

In the first experiment, adult male rats received laminectomy or unilateral contusion at 3rd-4th cervical spinal cord at 9 weeks of age. The ventilatory behavior in response to mild acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (10 episodes of 5 min of hypoxia [10% O2, 4% CO2, 86% N2] with 5 min of normoxia intervals) was measured by whole-body plethysmography at the acute (∼3 days), subchronic (∼2 weeks), and chronic (∼8 weeks) injury stages. The minute ventilation of contused animals is significantly enhanced following acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia due to an augmentation of the tidal volume at all time-points post-injury. However, acute intermittent hypercapnia-hypoxia-induced ventilatory long-term facilitation was only observed in uninjured animals at the acute stage. During the second experiment, the effect of acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia on respiration was examined in contused animals after a blockade of serotonin receptors, or adenosine 2A receptors. The results demonstrated that acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia-induced enhancement of minute ventilation was attenuated by a serotonin receptor antagonist (methysergide) but enhanced by an adenosine 2A receptor antagonist (KW6002) at the subchronic and chronic injury stages. These results suggested that acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia can induce respiratory recovery from acute to chronic injury stages. The therapeutic effectiveness of intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia is dampened by the inhibition of serotonin receptors, but a blockade of adenosine 2A receptors enhanced respiratory recovery induced by intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia.","adenosine","pubmed"

Caspase-3 is the final effector of caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) are key executors of caspase-independent apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether simultaneous inhibition of the 2 apoptosis pathways will be more beneficial for neuronal survival. Therefore, this study investigated the ability of coadministration of the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) and caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk to attenuate apoptosis in a rat SCI model. The rats were subjected to moderate contusive SCI. Locomotor function was measured using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating scales; neuronal apoptosis was detected using transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling; and immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to measure protein expression. We found the locomotor function of rats was weakened within 7 days post-SCI. At day 7 post-SCI, neuronal apoptosis dramatically increased and the expression of PARP-1, AIF, and cleaved caspase-3 was significantly upregulated. Further, Bcl-2 expression was significantly downregulated. The highest locomotor function recovery was recorded after the combined administration of 3-AB and z-DEVD-fmk for 7 days post-SCI when compared with 3-AB or z-DEVD-fmk administered alone. In addition, this combination therapy significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis by preventing upregulation of PARP-1 and AIF, inhibiting caspase-3 activation, and elevating Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that combination therapy is beneficial for neuronal function recovery in rats with SCI. The underlying mechanism may be associated with cosuppression of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis pathways.","adenosine","pubmed"

The striatal A2AR-D2R heteromer has a tetrameric structure and forms part of a signaling complex that includes a Gs and a Gi protein and the effector adenyl cyclase (subtype AC5). Another target of caffeine, the adenosine A1 receptor-dopamine D1 receptor (A1R-D1R) heteromer, seems to have a very similar structure. Initially suggested to be localized in the striatum, the A1R-D1R heteromer has now been identified in the spinal motoneuron and shown to mediate the spinally generated caffeine-induced locomotion. In this study, we review the recently discovered properties of A2AR-D2R and A1R-D1R heteromers. Our studies demonstrate that these complexes are a necessary condition to sustain the canonical antagonistic interaction between a Gs-coupled receptor (A2AR or D1R) and a Gi-coupled receptor (D2R or A1R) at the adenylyl cyclase level, which constitutes a new concept in the field of G protein-coupled receptor physiology and pharmacology.

Mice were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, ICA 20 μmol/kg (low dose) and ICA 50 μmol/kg (high dose) groups. And Behavioral, biochemical, molecular biological, immunofluorescent and histological assays were performed. First, ICA enhanced motor recovery greatly at 14, 28, and 42 days and protected spinal cord tissues especially in the high dose group. Meanwhile, ICA decreased the production of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase at 24 h and 3 days after SCI. The level of mitochondrial reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), Na+-K+-ATPase, mitochondrial membrane potential, state III respiration rate and the respiratory control ratio were also significantly increased, while malondialdehyde level and Ca2+ concentration were decreased by ICA. Furthermore, ICA decreased the expression of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins at 3 days after SCI. More importantly, transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Nissl staining implied that ICA at a high dose inhibited the neuronal apoptosis after SCI.

In this study, we discovered that the administration of leptin could improve locomotor recovery following SCI. The aim of this study was to determine the neuroprotective mechanism of leptin in vivo and in vitro. The neuronal apoptosis and Ca2+ imaging signal induced by ATP were suppressed by leptin, due to elevated caveolin-1 expression.

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death.","adenosine","pubmed"

Macrophages/microglia exist in two states-the classically activated M1 phenotype that confers pro-inflammatory effects or the alternatively activated M2 phenotype that confers anti-inflammatory effects. Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is an immunosuppressive molecule intricately involved in adaptive and innate immune responses and is able to dephosphorylate AMP to adenosine. However, it is not known if CD73 is able to modulate the macrophages/microglia transformation between the M1 and M2 phenotypes. We used gene-deficient mice to determine the role of CD73 in macrophages/microglia polarization post-SCI in vivo. We used small interference RNA (siRNA) or pcDNA3.1 to inhibit or overexpress CD73 in BV2 cells to verify anterior discovery in vitro. A combination of molecular and histological methods was used to detect the macrophages/microglia polarization and explore the mechanism both in vivo and in vitro. We found that SCI induced the upregulation of CD73 expression. CD73 deficient mice were noted to demonstrate overwhelming immune responses, few anti-inflammatory phenotype macrophages/microglia, and had a poorer locomotor recovery in comparison to wild-type mice that were also inflicted with SCI. In vitro studies found that CD73 suppression inhibited the expression of characteristic microglial anti-inflammatory polarization markers in BV2 cells, while the converse was noted in CD73 overexpression. Subsequent experiments confirmed that CD73 promoted microglia alternative activation by stimulating p38 MAPK. We were able to conclude that CD73 imparts neuroprotective effects by mediating macrophages/microglia polarization. These findings allow for better understanding of the modulatory factors involved in triggering the change in macrophages/microglia phenotypes, therefore uncovering additional molecules and pathways that may be targeted in the innovation of novel SCI therapies.","adenosine","pubmed"

Duloxetine treatment did not alter the noradrenaline release in the spinal cord after capsaicin injection (P = .415), or the fraction of nuclei positive for phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein in the locus coeruleus (P = 1.00 duloxetine versus vehicle 120 minutes after forepaw injection of vehicle and P = 1.00 duloxetine versus vehicle 120 minutes after forepaw injection of capsaicin). These findings suggest that 3 daily injections of duloxetine suppressed hyperalgesia and recovered impaired NSIA in rats 6 weeks after nerve injury.

Nissl and HE staining revealed that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and lesion size in the spinal cord of injured rats when compared to vehicle-treated animals. Spinal cord tissue was assessed by Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses 7days after injury for changes in expression of SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis proteins.

When administered immediately following the injury, recovery was observed as early as 3days following SCI and it persisted until the end of the study, 28days after the drug delivery.

To that end, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent C2 spinal cord hemisection (C2Hx) on day 0 and received either: (i) 0.15μg/kg of nanoconjugate-bound DPCPX or (ii) vehicle control (50μl distilled water).

We found that a single administration of the nanoconjugate-bound A1 adenosine receptor antagonist facilitated recovery of tidal volume and minute ventilation following SCI. Furthermore, the treatment attenuated SCI-associated increases in respiratory frequency.

Release of db-cAMP and/or ChABC from the microfibres was assessed in vitro using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Drug-impregnated microfibres were implanted into the hemisected thoracic spinal cord of rats, and treatment was evaluated using functional recovery examinations and immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that the microfibres containing db-cAMP and/or ChABC displayed a stable and prolonged release of each agent. Sustained delivery of db-cAMP and/or ChABC was found to promote axonal regenerative sprouting, functional recovery, and reduced glial scar formation when compared to untreated control animals. The combination of both db-cAMP and ChABC was determined to be more effective than using either drug alone in the treatment of SCI.

Phosphokinase A (PKA) is a prominent downstream target of cAMP that has been associated with neurite outgrowth. We hypothesized that rehabilitative motor training following spinal cord injuries promotes neuroplasticity via PKA activation. However, in two independent experiments, inhibition of cortical PKA using Rp-cAMPS throughout rehabilitative training robustly increased functional recovery and collateral sprouting of injured corticospinal tract axons, an indicator of neuroplasticity. Consistent with these in vivo findings, using cultured STHdh neurons, we found that Rp-cAMPS had no effect on the phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), a prominent downstream target of PKA, even with the concomitant application of the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin to increase cAMP levels. Conversely, when cAMP levels were increased using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, Rp-cAMPS potently inhibited CREB phosphorylation. Taken together, our results suggest that an alternate cAMP dependent pathway was involved in increasing CREB phosphorylation and neuroplasticity. This idea was supported by an in vitro neurite outgrowth assay, where inhibiting PKA did enhance neurite outgrowth. However, when PKA inhibition was combined with inhibition of EPAC2 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), another downstream target of cAMP in neurons, neurite outgrowth was significantly reduced. In conclusion, blocking PKA in cortical neurons of spinal cord injured rats increases neurite outgrowth of the lesioned corticospinal tract fibres and the efficacy of rehabilitative training, likely via EPAC.","adenosine","pubmed"

Eight weeks post-C2HS, rats began dAIH (10, 5-min episodes, 10.5% O2; 5-min intervals; 7days) followed by AIH 3× per week (3×wAIH) for 8 additional weeks with/without systemic A2A receptor inhibition (KW6002) on each AIH exposure day.

Systemic administration of drugs that improve respiratory function often cause deleterious side effects. The present study examines the applicability of a novel nanotechnology-based drug delivery system, which induces recovery of diaphragm function after SCI in the adult rat model. We developed a protein-coupled nanoconjugate to selectively deliver by transsynaptic transport small therapeutic amounts of an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist to the respiratory centers. A single administration of the nanoconjugate restored 75% of the respiratory drive at 0.1% of the systemic therapeutic drug dose. The reduction of the systemic dose may obviate the side effects. The recovery lasted for 4 weeks (the longest period studied). These findings have translational implications for patients with respiratory dysfunction after SCI. The leading causes of death in humans following SCI are respiratory complications secondary to paralysis of respiratory muscles. Systemic administration of methylxantines improves respiratory function but also leads to the development of deleterious side effects due to actions of the drug on nonrespiratory sites. The importance of the present study lies in the novel drug delivery approach that uses nanotechnology to selectively deliver recovery-inducing drugs to the respiratory centers exclusively. This strategy allows for a reduction in the therapeutic drug dose, which may reduce harmful side effects and markedly improve the quality of life for SCI patients.","adenosine","pubmed"

Recently, SCI therapy has been focused on preventing secondary injury to reduce both neuroinflammation and lesion size so that functional outcome after an SCI may be improved. Previous studies have shown that adenosine receptors (AR) are a major regulator of inflammation after an SCI. The current study was performed to examine the effect of caffeine, a pan-AR blocker, on spontaneous functional recovery after an SCI. Animals were assigned into 3 groups randomly, including sham, PBS and caffeine groups. The rat SCI was generated by an NYU impactor with a 10 g rod dropped from a 25 mm height at thoracic 9 spinal cord level. Caffeine and PBS were injected daily during the experiment period. Hind limb motor function was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale at 1 week and 4 weeks after the SCI. Spinal cord segments were collected after final behavior evaluation for morphological analysis. The tissue sparing was evaluated by luxol fast blue staining. Immunofluorescence stain was employed to assess astrocyte activation and neurofilament positioning, while microglia activation was examined by immunohistochemistry stain.The results showed that spontaneous functional recovery was blocked after the animals were subjected caffeine daily. Moreover, caffeine administration increased the demyelination area, promoted astrocyte and microglia activation and decreased the quantity of neurofilaments. These findings suggest that the neurotoxicity effect of caffeine may be associated with the inhibition of neural repair and the promotion of neuroinflammation.","adenosine","pubmed"

Immediately afterwards, the energy substrate acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC; 1 mg/day) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was infused intrathecally (sub-arachnoid) for 6 days via an L5/6 catheter attached to a subcutaneous Alzet pump.

Thus, we are going to screen the effectiveness of telmisartan in SCI for the development of it in clinical application. In the present study, we used compressive SCI in rats. Telmisartan was then used to evaluate the influence in rats after SCI. Change in PPARδ expression was identified by Western blots. Also, behavioral tests were performed to check the recovery of damage. Recovery of damage from SCI was observed in telmisartan-treated rats. Additionally, this action of telmisartan was inhibited by GSK0660 at the dose sufficient to block PPARδ. However, metformin at the dose enough to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase failed to produce similar action as telmisartan. Thus, mediation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in this action of telmisartan can be rule out. Moreover, telmisartan reversed the expressions of PPARδ in rats with SCI.

We have shown that increases in the number of dividing NG2-positive cells through short-term pharmacologic inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases contributes to recovery after spinal cord injury. A conditioning sciatic nerve crush (SNC) preceding spinal cord injury stimulates central sensory axon regeneration via the intraganglionic action of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Here, using bromodeoxyuridine, mitomycin (mitosis inhibitor), and cholera toxin B tracer, we demonstrate that SNC-induced division of spinal glia is related to the spinal induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and contributes to central sensory axon growth into the damaged spinal cord. Dividing cells were mainly NG2-positive and Iba1-positive and included myeloid NG2-positive populations. The cells dividing in response to SNC mainly matured into oligodendrocytes and microglia within the injured spinal cord. Some postmitotic cells remained NG2-reactive and were associated with regenerating fibers. Moreover, intraganglionic tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression was induced after administration of SNC or cyclic adenosine monophosphate analog (dbcAMP) to dorsal root ganglia in vivo and in primary adult dorsal root ganglia cultures. Collectively, these findings support a novel model whereby a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-activated regeneration program induced in sensory neurons by a conditioning peripheral nerve lesion uses tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 to protect against short-term proteolysis, enabling glial cell division and promoting axon growth into the damaged CNS.","adenosine","pubmed"

Thus, two weeks post-C2HS: 1) dAIH enhances breathing capacity by effects on contralateral diaphragm and T2 EIC activity; and 2) dAIH-induced recovery is A2A dependent in diaphragm, but not T2 EIC.

Compared to saline-treated controls, rats with dorsal hemisections that were treated with inosine showed three times as many synaptic contacts between corticospinal tract collaterals and long propriospinal interneurons that project from the cervical cord to the lumbar level. Inosine-treated rats also showed stronger serotonergic reinnervation of the lumbar cord than saline-treated controls, and performed well above controls in both open-field testing and a horizontal ladder rung-walking test. Inosine was equally effective whether delivered intracranially or intravenously, and has been shown to be safe for other indications in humans. Thus, inosine might be a useful therapeutic for improving outcome after spinal cord injury.","adenosine","pubmed"

Here we examine whether increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular signaling molecule with several known restorative actions on damaged neural tissue, could play a role. Subsequent changes in cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor ""cAMP response element-binding protein"" (CREB) are also analyzed. Rats with moderate weight-drop injury at segment T8 received 2h of NRM stimulation beginning three days after injury, followed immediately by separate extraction of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord for immunochemical assay. Controls lacked injury, stimulation or both. Injury reduced cAMP levels to under half of normal in all three spinal regions. NRM stimulation completely restored these levels, while producing no significant change in non-injured rats. Pretreatment with the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist pimozide (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) lowered cAMP in non-injured rats to injury amounts, which were unchanged by NRM stimulation. The phosphorylated fraction of PKA (pPKA) and CREB (pCREB) was reduced significantly in all three regions after SCI and restored by NRM stimulation, except for pCREB in lumbar segments. In conclusion, SCI produces spreading deficits in cAMP, pPKA and pCREB that are reversible by Gs protein-coupled 5-HT receptors responding to raphe-spinal activity, although these signaling molecules are not reactive to NRM stimulation in normal tissue. These findings can partly explain the benefits of NRM stimulation after SCI.","adenosine","pubmed"

Whereas the ATP concentration in the extracellular space is normally in the micromolar range, under these conditions it increases to millimolar levels. A number of ligand-gated cationic channels termed P2X receptors (7 mammalian subtypes), and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (8 mammalian subtypes) are located at astrocytes, as confirmed by the measurement of the respective mRNA and protein. Activation of both the P2X7 and P2Y1,2 subtypes identified at astrocytes initiates astrogliosis isolating damaged brain areas from surrounding healthy cells and synthesizing neurotrophins and pleotrophins that participate in neuronal recovery. Astrocytes are considered as cells of high plasticity which may alter their properties in a culture medium. Therefore, recent work concentrates on investigating nucleotide effects at in situ (acute brain slices) and in vivo astrocytes. A wealth of data relates to the involvement of purinergic mechanisms in astrogliosis induced by acute CNS injury such as mechanical trauma and hypoxia/ischemia. The released ATP may act within minutes as an excitotoxic molecule; at a longer time-scale within days it causes neuroinflammation. These effects sum up as necrosis/apoptosis on the one hand and proliferation on the other. Although the role of nucleotides in chronic neurodegenerative illnesses is not quite clear, it appears that they aggravate the consequences of the primary disease. Epilepsy and neuropathic pain are also associated with the release of ATP and a pathologic glia-neuron interaction leading to astrogliosis and cell death. In view of these considerations, P2 receptor antagonists may open new therapeutic vistas in all forms of acute and chronic CNS damage.","adenosine","pubmed"

VPA also significantly reduced P2X4 R expression post-SCI. Furthermore, in vitro study indicated that VPA, but not the other HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA), caused downregulation of P2X4 R in microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

In another study, transplanted SCs transduced to generate a bifunctional neurotrophin (D15A) led to significant increases in graft SCs and axons, including supraspinal and myelinated axons. Here we studied the growth and myelination of local and supraspinal axons and functional outcome following the combination of rolipram administration and neurotrophin-transduced SC implantation after SCI. Rolipram was administered subcutaneously for 4 weeks immediately after contusion at vertebral T8 (25.0-mm weight drop, MASCIS impactor).

SC myelinated axons were increased significantly in GFP SC with rolipram-treated animals compared to animals receiving SCI alone. Rolipram administered with either GFP or GFP-D15A SCs significantly increased numbers of brain stem-derived axons below the lesion/implant area and improved hindlimb function. Compared to the single treatments, the combination led to the largest SC grafts, the highest numbers of serotonergic fibers in the grafts, and increased numbers of axons from the reticular formation below the lesion/implant area and provided the greatest improvement in hindlimb function.

Induction of self-renewal and proliferation of endogenous regenerative machinery with noninvasive and nontoxic therapies could constitute a real hope and an alternative to cell transplantation for spinal cord injury patients. We previously showed that FM19G11 promotes differentiation of adult spinal cord-derived ependymal stem cells under hypoxia. Interestingly, FM19G11 induces self-renewal of these ependymal stem cells grown under normoxia. The analysis of the mechanism of action revealed an early increment of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 and 2 with an early drop of ATP, followed by a subsequent compensatory recovery with activated mitochondrial metabolism and the induction of glucose uptake by upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-4. Here we show that phosphorylation of AKT and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is involved in FM19G11-dependent activation of GLUT-4, glucose influx, and consequently in stem cell self-renewal. Small interfering RNA of uncoupling protein 1/2, GLUT-4 and pharmacological inhibitors of AKT, mTOR and AMPK signaling blocked the FM19G11-dependent induction of the self-renewal-related markers Sox2, Oct4, and Notch1. Importantly, FM19G11-treated animals showed accelerated locomotor recovery. In vivo intrathecal sustained administration of FM19G11 in rats after spinal cord injury showed more neurofilament TUJ1-positive fibers crossing the injured area surrounded by an increase of neural precursor Vimentin-positive cells.

However, more recent studies showed that rolipram has some adverse effects in spinal cord repair. Here, we developed a drug-delivery platform for the local delivery of rolipram into the spinal cord. The potential of drug-eluting microfibrous patches for continuous delivery of high and low-dose rolipram concentrations was characterized in vitro. Following C5 hemisections, athymic rats were treated with patches loaded with low and high doses of rolipram. In general, animals treated with low-dose rolipram experienced greater functional and anatomical recovery relative to all other groups. Outcomes from the high-dose rolipram treatment were similar to those with no treatment. In addition, high-dose treated animals experienced reduced survival rates suggesting that systemic toxicity was reached. With the ability to control the release of drug dosage locally within the spinal cord, drug-eluting microfibrous patches demonstrate the importance of appropriate local release-kinetics of rolipram, proving their usefulness as a therapeutic platform for the study and repair of SCI.","adenosine","pubmed"

Among those, we have focused on microRNA 486, which directly represses NeuroD6 expression through a conserved sequence in its untranslated region. We correlated the overexpression of microRNA 486 in motor neurons with a poor outcome due to progressive neurodegeneration and a pathophysiology that is mediated by reactive oxygen species. The expression of microRNA 486 was induced by reactive oxygen species that were produced by inflammatory factors, and reactive oxygen species were accumulated in response to the knockdown of NeuroD6, which enhances the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 3 and thioredoxin-like 1 after traumatic spinal cord injury. NeuroD6 directly bound to regulatory regions of thioredoxin-like 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 in motor neurons and activated their expression, which promoted reactive oxygen species scavenging. Moreover, knocking down microRNA 486 induced the expression of NeuroD6, which effectively ameliorated the spinal cord injury and allowed the mice to recover motor function. The infusion of exogenic NeuroD6 in spinal cord injury lesions effectively blocked apoptosis by reactivating thioredoxin-like 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3, which was accompanied by a recovery of motor function. Collectively, these findings have identified a novel microRNA in spinal cord injury lesions called microRNA 486, demonstrating a new role for NeuroD6 in neuroprotection, and suggest a potential therapeutic target for spinal cord injuries.","adenosine","pubmed"

In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed a significant reduction in ATP release after weight-drop injury in mice with deletion of Cx43 compared with Cx43-expressing littermates, both on a Cx30 knockout background. Moreover, astrogliosis and microglia activation were reduced in peritraumatic areas of those mice lacking Cx43; motor recovery was also significantly improved, and the traumatic lesion was smaller.

GRP cells survived, differentiated, and formed extensive transplants that were well integrated with host tissue. Presence of GRP cells increased the amount of tissue in the lesion; however, cAMP reduced the graft size. White matter sparing at the lesion epicenter was not affected. Serotonergic input to the lumbosacral spinal cord was not affected by treatment, but the amount of serotonin immediately caudal to the lesion was reduced in the cAMP groups. Using telemetric monitoring of corpus spongiosum penis pressure we show that the cAMP groups regained the same number of micturitions per 24hours when compared to the AM group, however, the frequency of peak pressures was increased in these groups compared to the AM group. In contrast, the GRP groups had similar frequency of peak pressures compared to baseline and the AM group. Animals that received GRP cells regained the same number of erectile events per 24hours compared to baseline and the AM group. Since cAMP reduced the GRP transplant graft, and some modest positive effects were seen that could be attributable to both GRP or cAMP, future research is required to determine how cAMP affects survival, proliferation, and/or function of progenitor cells and how this is related to function. cAMP may not always be a desirable addition to a progenitor cell transplantation strategy after SCI.","adenosine","pubmed"

The rats were divided into four groups: SCI plus ATP, SCI plus saline, SCI plus ATP and rapamycin, and sham-operated. Using immunostaining studies, Western blot analyses and real-time qualitative RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrated that the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway is present in the injured spinal cord and the expression of its components at the protein and mRNA levels is significantly elevated by exogenous administration of ATP following SCI. We observed the effectiveness of the activated Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in improving locomotor recovery, significantly increasing the expression of nestin, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), neuron specific enolase (NSE), and neurofilament 200 (NF200), and relatively inhibiting excessive reactive astrogliosis after SCI in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. We concluded that ATP injection produced a significant activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in the injured spinal cord and that enhancement of rapamycin-sensitive signaling produces beneficial effects on SCI-induced motor function defects and repair potential. We suggest that modulation of this protein kinase signaling pathway activity should be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for SCI.","adenosine","pubmed"

We hypothesized that SCI might lead to alteration in the RNA editing of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors that govern critical determinants of neuronal survival. To this end, we examined the molecular changes set in motion by SCI that affect the channel properties of AMPA receptors. SCI strongly reduced the level of AMPA receptor R/G editing, involving not only the site of the lesion but also adjacent areas of the cord spared by the lesion. The effects, with changes for some subunits and loci, were observed as long as 30 days after lesioning and may correlate with a partial decrease in enzymatic activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), as deduced from the analysis of ADAR2 self-editing. The reduced editing at the R/G site of glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs) is likely to reduce post-synaptic excitatory responses to glutamate, thus limiting the progression of cell death; however, prolonged suppression of GluR function in later stages may hinder synaptic plasticity. These observations provide the first direct evidence of the potential contribution of RNA editing to excitatory neural injury and recovery after SCI.","adenosine","pubmed"

But another aspect of mitochondrial function is the generation of more than 90% of cellular energy in the form of ATP, mediated by the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) process. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a central OxPhos component and changes in its activity reflect changes in energy demand. A recent study suggests that respiratory muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is compromised via alterations in mitochondrial function. In an animal model of cervical spinal cord hemisection (C2HS) respiratory dysfunction, we have shown that theophylline improves respiratory function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that theophylline improves respiratory function at the cellular level via improved mitochondrial function in the C2HS model. We demonstrate that CcO activity was significantly (33%) increased in the spinal cord adjacent to the site of injury (C3-C5), and that administration of theophylline (20mg/kg 3x daily orally) after C2HS leads to an even more pronounced increase in CcO activity of 62% compared to sham-operated animals. These results are paralleled by a significant increase in cellular ATP levels (51% in the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection). We conclude that C2HS increases energy demand and activates mitochondrial respiration, and that theophylline treatment improves energy levels through activation of the mitochondrial OxPhos process to provide energy for tissue repair and functional recovery after paralysis in the C2HS model.","adenosine","pubmed"

Spontaneous functional recovery rarely occurs. It has been widely accepted that the extracellular environment of the CNS inhibits neuronal regeneration. However, it should be noted that another reason for injured neurons failing to regenerate is their weak intrinsic ability to do so. The regeneration of injured neurons is a process involving many intracellular phenomena, including cytoskeletal changes, gene and protein expression, and changes in the responsiveness to extracellular cues. The capacity of injured neurons to regenerate is modulated to some extent by changes in the expression of intracellular signaling molecules such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Knowledge of these effects has guided the development of animal models for regenerative therapies of CNS injury. Enhancing the intrinsic regenerative machinery of injured axons in the adult CNS is a potentially powerful strategy for treating patients with a CNS injury.","adenosine","pubmed"

In this study, we show a decrease in GLAST mRNA in the lesion center and caudal portions at 24 h post-spinal cord injury. In an in vitro system, the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate and astrocytic GLAST mRNA levels were significantly decreased after exposure to ATP and its P2X(7)R agonist, 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP. ATP- or 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP-induced inhibitory effect on GLAST mRNA expression was blocked by the irreversible P2X(7)R blocker, oxidized ATP, or when P2X(7)R mRNA expression was reduced by the lentivirus-short hairpin RNA knockdown approach. Furthermore, deletion of the GLAST promoter and RNA decay assays showed that P2X(7)R signaling triggered post-transcriptional regulation of GLAST expression via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase cascade. The signaling pathway participating in the P2X(7)R effect on GLAST mRNA expression was identified as a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase-phospholipase Cgamma involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and protein kinase C.

Here we have tested the neuroprotective effects of a systemically administered P2X7R antagonist, Brilliant blue G (BBG), in a weight-drop model of thoracic SCI in rats. Administration of BBG 15 min after injury reduced spinal cord anatomic damage and improved motor recovery without evident toxicity. Moreover, BBG treatment directly reduced local activation of astrocytes and microglia, as well as neutrophil infiltration. These observations suggest that BBG not only protected spinal cord neurons from purinergic excitotoxicity, but also reduced local inflammatory responses.

Cervical SCI often results in a compromised respiratory system. Primary treatment of SCI patients with respiratory insufficiency continues to be with mechanical ventilatory support. In an animal model of SCI, an upper cervical spinal cord hemisection paralyzes the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the side of injury. However, a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore respiratory function after injury. In this review, restoration of respiratory activity following systemic administration of theophylline, a respiratory stimulant will be discussed. Pharmacologically, theophylline is a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a bronchodilator. It has been used in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in treatment of apnea in premature infants. However, the clinical use of theophylline to improve respiration in SCI patients with respiratory deficits is a more recent approach. This review will focus on the use of theophylline to restore respiratory activity in an animal model of SCI. In this model, a C2 hemisection (C2HS) interrupts the major descending respiratory pathways and paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. The review also highlights involvement of central and peripheral adenosine receptors in functional restitution. Biochemical binding assays that highlight changes in adenosine receptors after chronic theophylline administration are discussed as they pertain to understanding adenosine receptor-mediation in functional recovery.

For these reasons, and that oligodendrocyte and axon survival may be related, various neuroprotective strategies after spinal cord injury are being investigated. We previously demonstrated that oligodendrocytes in the adult rat epicenter ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) express 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and that their death was attenuated up to 3 days after contusive cervical SCI when rolipram, a specific inhibitor of PDE4, was administered.

This is the first demonstration of improved descending and ascending long-tract axonal conductivity across a SCI with this pharmacological approach. Since descending long-tract axonal conductivity did not return to normal, further evaluations of the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic window of rolipram as well as optimal combinations are necessary before consideration for neuroprotection in humans with SCI.","adenosine","pubmed"

Here, we test the hypothesis that an acute administration of rolipram will increase spinal and medullary levels of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and induce phrenic nerve recovery after cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left C2 hemisection surgery 1 week before experimentation. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anesthetized, vagotomized, and pancuronium paralyzed rats, and rolipram was intravenously applied (2 mg/kg). Intravenous administration of rolipram increased phrenic nerve output in uninjured control and left C2 spinal cord-hemisected rats. In addition, rolipram restored respiratory-related activity to the left phrenic nerve made quiescent by the hemisection. In both uninjured and hemisected rats, rolipram significantly enhanced phrenic inspiratory burst amplitude and burst area compared with predrug values. Also, rolipram concomitantly increased spinal and medullary cAMP. These results suggest that a phosphodiesterase inhibitor capable of elevating cAMP levels can enhance phrenic nerve output and restore respiratory-related phrenic nerve function after high cervical spinal cord injury.

However, activation of various physiological mechanisms secondary to the initial trauma including edema, inflammation, excito-toxicity, excessive cytokine release and apoptosis may exacerbate the injury and/or retard natural repair mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSCs) inhibits H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis of cultured spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulting in increased cell survival. The ATSC extracts mediated this effect by decreasing caspase-3 and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activity, inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria and reducing Bax expression levels in cells. Direct injection of ATSC extracts mixed with Matrigel into the spinal cord immediately after SCI also resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death, astrogliosis and hypo-myelination but did not reduce the extent of microglia infiltration. Moreover, animals injected with the ATSC extract showed significant functional improvement of hind limbs as measured by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale. Collectively, these studies show a prominent therapeutic effect of ATSC cytoplasmic extracts on SCI principally caused by an inhibition of apoptosis-mediated cell death, which spares white matter, oligodendrocytes and neurons at the site of injury. The ability of ATSC extracts to prevent secondary pathological events and improve neurologic function after SCI suggests that extracts prepared from autologous cells harvested from SCI patients may have clinical utility.","adenosine","pubmed"

Seven weeks after spinal injury, the Basso-Beattie Bresnahan locomotor scores were significantly improved in the 3-day delayed NgR(310)ecto-Fc treatment group (9.5 +/- 0.7; n = 16) versus the vehicle-treated group, (6.75 +/- 0.7; n = 15) (p < or = 0.01, analysis of variance). The percentage of NgR(310)ecto-Fc-treated animals able to support their weight was twice that in the control group. Delayed therapy was as efficacious as acute therapy. Addition of rolipram did not alter recovery. The beneficial behavioral effects of NgR(310)ecto-Fc correlated with sprouting of raphespinal axons in the caudal spinal cord and of corticospinal axons in the rostral spinal cord. NgR(310)ecto-Fc treatment improves outcome in a rodent model that closely mimicked human spinal cord injury.","adenosine","pubmed"

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of peripherally located adenosine A2 receptors on recovery of respiratory function after cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection. Respiratory activity was electrophysiologically assessed (under standardized recording conditions) in C2-hemisected adult rats with the carotid bodies intact (H-CBI; n=12) or excised (H-CBE; n=12). Animals were administered the adenosine A2 receptor agonist, CGS-21680, followed by the A1 receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), or administered DPCPX alone. Recovered respiratory activity, characterized as drug-induced activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve of C2-hemisected animals in H-CBI and H-CBE rats, was compared. Recovered respiratory activity was calculated by dividing drug-induced activity in the left phrenic nerve by activity in the right phrenic nerve. Administration of CGS-21680 before DPCPX (n=6) in H-CBI rats induced a significantly greater recovery (58.5 +/- 3.6%) than when DPCPX (42.6 +/- 4.6%) was administered (n=6) alone. In H-CBE rats, prior administration of CGS-21680 (n=6) did not enhance recovery over that induced by DPCPX (n=6) alone. Recovery in H-CBE rats amounted to 39.7 +/- 3.7% and 38.4 + 4.2%, respectively. Our results suggest that adenosine A2 receptors located in the carotid bodies can enhance the magnitude of adenosine A1 receptor-mediated recovery of respiratory function after C2 hemisection. We conclude that a novel approach of targeting peripheral and central adenosine receptors can be therapeutically beneficial in alleviating compromised respiratory function after cervical spinal cord injury.","adenosine","pubmed"

Due to accumulation of numerous axon-growth inhibitory molecules the lesion scar is considered a major impediment for axon regeneration. Following transection of the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) at thoracic level 8 in adult rats, transient suppression of collagenous scarring in the lesion zone by local application of a potent iron chelator and cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulted in the delay of fibrous scarring. Treated animals displayed long-distance growth of CST axons through the lesion area extending for up to 1.5-2 cm into the distal cord. In addition, the treatment showed a strong neuroprotective effect, rescuing cortical motoneurons projecting into the CST that normally die (30%) after thoracic axotomy. Further, anterogradely traced CST axons regenerated through both grey and white matter and developed terminal arborizations in grey matter regions. In contrast to controls, injured animals receiving treatment showed significant functional recovery in the open field, in the horizontal ladder and in CatWalk locomotor tasks. We conclude that the fibrous lesion scar plays a pivotal role as a growth barrier for regenerating axons in adult spinal cord and that a delay in fibrotic scarring by local inhibition of collagen biosynthesis and basement membrane deposition is a promising and unique therapeutic strategy for treating human spinal trauma.","adenosine","pubmed"

The purpose of this review is to describe mechanisms that underlie theophylline-induced recovery of respiratory-related function following C2 hemisection and to underscore the therapeutic potential of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline mediates recovery of respiratory-related activity via antagonism of central adenosine A(1) receptors. When administered chronically, the drug restores and maintains recovered function. Since theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist with affinity for both the adenosine A(1) and A(2) receptors, we assessed the relative contributions of each receptor to functional recovery. While A(1) receptor antagonism plays a predominant role, activation of the A(2) receptors by specific agonists subserves the A(1) receptor-mediated actions. That is, when an adenosine A(2) receptor agonist is administered first, it primes the system such that subsequent administration of the A(1) antagonist induces a greater degree of recovered respiratory activity than when the antagonist alone is administered. Chronic oral administration of theophylline in C2 hemisected animals demonstrates that even when animals have been weaned from the drug, theophylline-induced recovered respiratory actions persist. This suggests that in clinical application, it may not be necessary to maintain patients on long-term theophylline. We have shown that recovery of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve can occur spontaneously 3-4 months after C2 hemisection. Theophylline administration after this post-injury period obliterates/negates the recovery function. This indicates strongly that there is therapeutic window (more acutely after injury) for the initiation of theophylline therapy. We have also demonstrated that peripheral (carotid bodies) adenosine A(1) receptors can be selectively activated to modulate theophylline-induced CNS actions. Blocking central adenosine receptors while simultaneously activating peripheral adenosine receptors minimizes the potential of respiratory muscle fatigue with theophylline. The significance of the current findings lies in the potential clinical application of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. The ultimate goal of theophylline therapy is to wean ventilator-dependent patients off ventilatory support. Thus far, our animal studies suggest that the onset of theophylline therapy must be soon after injury.","adenosine","pubmed"

In this model, an upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemi paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Theophylline restores respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed hemidiaphragm via activation of a latent respiratory motor pathway. Antagonism of central adenosine A1 receptors mediates this action. Theophylline also enhances respiratory frequency, f, defined as breaths per minute. Thus, long-term use may result in respiratory muscle or motoneuron fatigue particularly after spinal cord injury. We assessed the effects of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, N6-p-sulfophenyladenosine (p-SPA) on theophylline's action in our model under standardized recording conditions. Four groups of rats, classified as hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies denervated (H-CBD or NH-CBD), and hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies intact (H-CBI or NH-CBI ) were used in the study. Eight days after recovery from carotid denervation, a left C2 hemi was performed in H-CBD rats. C2 hemi was also performed in H-CBI animals, and 24 h later, electrophysiologic experiments on respiratory activity were conducted in both groups of animals. Two groups using nonhemisected controls were also employed as described above. In H-CBD rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced respiratory-related activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In NH-CBD rats, theophylline significantly enhanced f. In both H-CBD and NH-CBD rats, p-SPA (0.25 mg/kg) did not significantly change theophylline-induced effects. In H-CBI rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In H-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced the values to pre-theophylline discharge levels. Recovered activity was not obliterated with the agonist. In NH-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced theophylline-induced effects to pre-drug discharge levels. Adenosine A1 and A2A receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the carotid bodies. The significance of our findings is that theophylline-induced effects can be normalized to pre-drug levels by the selective activation of peripheral adenosine A1 receptors. The therapeutic benefits of theophylline, i.e., recovered respiratory function after paralysis, however, persists. The potential therapeutic impact is that respiratory muscle fatigue associated with long-term theophylline use may be minimized by a novel therapeutic approach.","adenosine","pubmed"

University of Miami School of Medicine/Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami VA Medical Center, FL, USA.

Muscle biopsies from the SCI patients who received 24 h of MP showed muscle damage consistent with ACM in four out of five cases. EMG studies demonstrated myopathic changes in the MP-treated patients. In the three patients who had SCI but did not receive MP, muscle biopsies were normal and EMGs did not reveal evidence of myopathy. Our data suggest that MP in the dose recommended by the NASCIS may cause ACM. If this is true, part of the improvement of neurological recovery showed in NASCIS may be only a recording of the natural recovery of ACM, instead of any protection that MP offers to the injured spinal cord.","adenosine","pubmed"

To assess the potential effect of P2X7R blockade in ameliorating acute spinal cord injury (SCI), we delivered P2X7R antagonists OxATP or PPADS to rats after acute impact injury.

Following is a brief summary of previous findings that led us to examine cAMP levels after SCI and to test the hypothesis that elevating the level of cAMP could improve nerve fiber growth and functional outcome. We employed in these experiments an incomplete SCI model, whereby a specific weight is dropped from a consistent height onto the exposed surface of the spinal cord at the thoracic (chest) level to induce a bruising type injury. The elevation of cAMP was used in combination with the transplantation of a type of peripheral nerve cells, called Schwann cells. Lastly, the implications of our findings for human SCI repair are discussed.Regeneration of neurons within the central nervous system following SCI is limited by the presence of inhibitory molecules and a lack of growth supporting molecules at the injury site, by the physical barrier created by a scar that forms around the injury site, and by a reduced intrinsic capacity for growth in neurons that occurs after development and maturation. Transplantation of cells from the peripheral nervous system -- Schwann cells -- can be used to replace lost tissue within the injured spinal cord and form an environment conducive for nerve fiber re-growth. Importantly, Schwann cell transplantation is clinically relevant because of the feasibility of autologous transplantation from harvested peripheral nerves for use in human SCI. However, Schwann cell grafts do not enable regenerated nerve fibers to grow out of the transplant, and they elicit only a weak response from neurons from the brain that are important for voluntary control of walking. These limitations have stimulated the development of combination strategies that will improve the ability of Schwann cells to promote repair of the injured spinal cord and enhance functional recovery.","adenosine","pubmed"

Theophylline mediates functional recovery by central nervous system adenosine A1 receptor antagonism; however, it is unclear whether adenosine receptors are altered after prolonged postinjury periods and whether theophylline can further enhance restored respiratory function that occurs spontaneously. To assess putative effects of systemic theophylline administration on further enhancing spontaneous respiratory muscle recovery 4 months after C2 hemisection in rats and to determine whether adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression is altered in these animals. Electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity in the phrenic nerves was conducted in C2 hemisected rats 4 months after hemisection under standardized conditions. Immediately thereafter, rats were killed and the cervical spinal cords were prepared for adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. Spontaneous recovery of respiratory activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve was detected in a majority (15/20) of C2 hemisected animals and amounted to 44.06% +/- 2.38% when expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral phrenic nerve in noninjured animals. At the optimal dosage used in the acute studies, theophylline (15 mg/kg) did not enhance, but rather unexpectedly blocked, recovered respiratory activity in 4 out of 5 animals tested. At dosages of 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, the drug blocked recovered respiratory activity in 3 out of 4 and 3 out of 5 animals tested, respectively. Quantitative analysis of adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression did not reveal a significant difference between experimental animals and sham-operated animals. The blockade or attenuation of spontaneously recovered respiratory activity following theophylline administration cannot be attributed to changes in adenosine A1 receptors because there were no significant differences in adenosine A1 mRNA expression with sham-operated animals. Lack of alteration in A1 mRNA expression 4 months after cervical SCI suggests that A1 receptor plasticity is not activated by chronic injury. Obliteration of spontaneous recovery with theophylline most likely involves a separate unknown mechanism. These findings suggest that there may be a limited therapeutic window for the clinical application of theophylline in SCI patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline may be more effective clinically in the acute phase of injury rather than in the chronic phase.","adenosine","pubmed"

Previous studies from our laboratory have established that a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore function to a hemidiaphragm paralysed by upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection during a reflex known as the 'crossed phrenic phenomenon'. In addition, theophylline, a general adenosine A1 and A2 receptor antagonist, can activate the latent pathway by acting centrally through antagonism at adenosine receptors. 2. The present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in inducing functional recovery in our model of spinal cord injury. Specific adenosine A1 and A2 agonists and antagonists were used in an electrophysiological study. 3. Our results demonstrate that, in hemisected rats, systemic administration of the adenosine A1 receptor-specific antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) restores, in a dose-dependent manner, phrenic nerve respiratory related output that is lost following hemisection. Furthermore, DPCPX augments respiratory activity in non-injured animals. The A2 receptor agonist CGS-21680 mediates its effects by predominantly acting on peripheral rather than central nervous system (CNS) receptors. CGS-21680 modulates respiratory related phrenic nerve activity in non-injured animals by enhancing tonic activity, but does not induce recovery of phrenic nerve activity in hemisected animals in the majority of cases. When CGS-21680 was administered prior to DPCPX in hemisected rats, the magnitude of recovery of respiratory function was significantly greater than that elicited by DPCPX alone. However, when the A2 receptor agonist was administered after DPCPX, the magnitude of recovery was virtually unchanged, whereas activity in the right phrenic nerve was significantly enhanced. The A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine depressed respiratory activity in non-injured, as well as hemisected, rats. The A2 receptor antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine did not affect respiratory activity. 4. We conclude that while antagonism at central adenosine A1 receptors mediates functional restitution in hemisected animals, activation of A2 receptors located outside of the CNS subserves the A1 receptor-mediated respiratory recovery.","adenosine","pubmed"

Animals that received ATL-146e for 3 hours (Tarlov score, 4.3 +/- 0.22; P <.001) or 1.5 hours (Tarlov score, 2.7 +/- 0.6; P <.05) had improved neurologic outcomes compared with rabbits that received saline solution (Tarlov score, 0.6 +/- 0.29). Animals that received ATL-146e for 1 hour (Tarlov score, 0.7 +/- 0.8) were not significantly different from those animals that received saline solution. Systemic ATL-146e, given during reperfusion, results in time-dependent improvement in spinal cord function after ischemia. This implies that the mechanism of spinal reperfusion injury includes leukocyte-mediated inflammation at a critical post-ischemic time interval.","adenosine","pubmed"

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A1 adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase; or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine A1 receptors. Theophylline induced, and maintained, hemidiaphragmatic recovery for prolonged periods after C2 spinal cord hemisection in rats and may prove to be beneficial in assisting respiration in spinal cord injury patients.","adenosine","pubmed"

The present study seeks to extend the previous investigations by contrasting and quantitating the actions of theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline, enprofylline, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline in restoring function 24 h after hemidiaphragm paralysis. The alkylxanthines were selected based on their diverse pharmacologic profiles to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie functional recovery after spinal cord injury. To quantitatively assess the magnitude of recovery, electrophysiological experiments were conducted on pancuronium-paralyzed, hemisected animals under standardized recording conditions. The total absence of respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and paralyzed hemidiaphragm was used as the index of a functionally complete hemisection. Thereafter, drug-induced recovered activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection was quantified and expressed either as a percentage of contralateral phrenic nerve activity in the same animal prior to drug administration or as a percentage of predrug activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals. With either approach, theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced respiratory-related recovered activity. Enprofylline, a potent bronchodilator, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist with limited access to the central nervous system, were ineffective. Maximal recovery was attained with theophylline (15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 mg/kg). At these doses, theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline induced recovery that was 70.0 +/- 2.5 and 69.3 +/- 4.1% of predrug contralateral nerve activity respectively. When expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude changed to 32.9 +/- 4.9 and 35.7 +/- 6.9%, respectively. Involvement of adenosine receptors in the alkylxanthine-induced actions was confirmed in experiments with the adenosine analog, N6 (l-2-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA). It is concluded that central adenosine receptor-mediated mechanisms are implicated in the recovery of respiratory-related activity after spinal cord injury.

Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and injured by placing a 190-gm weight on the spinal cord for 5 minutes. Biochemical analysis of the injured segment revealed a significant depletion in the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (P-creatine), and total adenylates for the entire 24-hour recovery period. Glucose levels initially declined, but by 1 hour had normalized, and at 8 and 24 hours were significantly supranormal. The lactate/pyruvate ratio and tissue lactate concentrations increased four and five and half times, respectively, for the first 4 hours after injury. Between 8 and 24 hours, lactate levels remained elevated, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio declined to contol levels as the result of a significant rise in the tissue pyruvate concentration. This sequence of metabolic changes suggested that metabolism was probably not homogeneous throughout the injured segment, and that tissue metabolic rate was depressed for the initial 4 hours after trauma then increased in metabolically active tissue for the remainder of the 24-hour recovery period. This model of spinal cord trauma results in a severe, prolonged ischemia and metabolic injury to the affected tissue. Whether these metabolic changes results from or cause the tissue damage and irreversible paraplegia associated with this type of spinal cord injury remains to be determined.","adenosine","pubmed"

To date, systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) have shown promise in SCI. However, systemic immunosuppression can have detrimental side effects. Therefore, immunomodulatory approaches including the use of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) could represent an attractive alternative. While emerging preclinical data suggests that hIgG is neuroprotective after SCI, the optimal time window of administration and the mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. These knowledge gaps were the focus of this research study. Female adult Wistar rats received a clip compression-contusion SCI at the C7/T1 level of the spinal cord. Injured rats were randomized, in a blinded manner, to receive a single intravenous bolus of hIgG (2 g/kg) or control buffer at 15 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) or 4 h post-SCI. At 24 h and 8 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological and neurobehavioral analyses were undertaken. At all 3 administration time points, hIgG (2 g/kg) resulted in significantly better short-term and long-term outcomes as compared to control buffer. No significant differences were observed when comparing outcomes between the different time points of administration. At 24 h post-injury, hIgG (2 g/kg) administration enhanced the integrity of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) by increasing expression of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in BSCB integrity were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, lower amounts of albumin and Evans Blue in the injured spinal cord and greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. After hIgG (2 g/kg) treatment, there were more neutrophils in the spleen and fewer neutrophils in the blood. hIgG also co-localized with endothelial cell ligands that mediate neutrophil extravasation into the injured spinal cord. Importantly, short-term effects of delayed hIgG (2 g/kg) administration were associated with enhanced tissue and neuron preservation, as well as neurobehavioral and sensory recovery at 8 weeks post-SCI. hIgG (2 g/kg) shows promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by hIgG (2 g/kg) in the injured spinal cord might be explained in twofold. First, hIgG might antagonize neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord by co-localizing with endothelial cell ligands that mediate various steps in neutrophil extravasation. Second, hIgG could traffic neutrophils towards the spleen by increasing expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. Overall, we demonstrate that delayed administration of hIgG (2 g/kg) at 1 and 4-h post-injury enhances short-term and long-term benefits after SCI by modulating local and systemic neuroinflammatory cascades.","albumin","pubmed"

Albumin-based nanoparticles, which can encapsulate therapeutic drugs and release cargo in a controlled pattern, show high biocompatibility and low toxicity. The Nogo protein, expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes, can inhibit axonal growth by binding with the axonal Nogo receptor (NgR). Peptide NEP1-40, an NgR antagonist, can bind specifically to Nogo, significantly improving functional recovery and axon growth in the corticospinal tract. Therefore, we hypothesized that delivering MP within nanoparticles decorated with NEP1-40 could avoid the disadvantages of free MP and enhance its therapeutic efficacy against SCI. We used human serum albumin to prepare MP-loaded NPs (MP-NPs), to whose surface we conjugated NEP1-40 to form NEP1-40-MP-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated successful formation of nanoparticles. NEP1-40-MP-NPs were taken up significantly better than MP-NPs by the Nogo-positive cell line RSC-96 and were associated with significantly higher Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores in rats recovering from SCI. Micro-computed tomography assay showed that NEP1-40-MP-NPs mitigated SCI-associated loss of bone mineral density and accelerated spinal cord repair. NEP1-40-MP-NPs can enhance the therapeutic effects of MP against SCI. This novel platform may also be useful for delivering other types of drugs.","albumin","pubmed"

Medicine has explored therapeutic options for patients with TSCI with the aim to improve their quality of life. One alternative has been the development of biomaterials that offer neuroprotection or neuroregeneration of damaged nerve tissue. The microinjection of iodine-doped polypyrrole particles synthesised by plasma (PPPy/I) has shown neuroprotective effects that favour motor function recovery in experimental animals with TSCI. However, their ability to migrate into the tissue has led to the need to test a suspension vehicle that enables the concentration of particles at the site of injury. To achieve this, two biomaterials of PPPy/I (P1 and P2) were studied. The superficial physicochemical characterisation of the polymers was performed by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle. The rheological performance under oscillatory shear rate of suspensions containing both polymers alone and in combination with bovine serum albumin was also studied. In vivo tests were performed on animals with and without TSCI that were microinjected with particles of P1 or P2 in suspension using a solution of rat serum albumin. Exposure to the protein solutions generates a protein multilayer on the surface of the biomaterials that can drastically change the behaviour of both P1 and P2, which led to severe repercussions in the in vivo assays. The results showed that surface chemistry plays an important role in the performance and that it is possible to treat TSCI with these materials. The interaction of the surface of materials PPPy/I.1 (P1) and PPPy/I.2 (P2) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in a series of changes in the surface chemistry of both biomaterials. The contact angle study (Fig. A) showed the presence of a critical BSA concentration ([BSA]c), in which a monolayer was formed on both polymers and then a stable protein multilayer, as evidenced by the establishment of a plateau in the determination of the contact angle. In vivo tests showed that this interaction may be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), depending on the surface characteristics with or without rat serum albumin (RSA). The TSCI + P1 and TSCI + P2 + RSA groups obtained significant differences in functional recovery compared with the control group according to the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale (BBB).","albumin","pubmed"

In the current study, we investigated the acute and long-term effects of using rhBMP-2 in the posterolateral spine at the level of a spinal cord injury in rats. Fifty-two rats underwent a T10 dorsal hemisection and were assigned to one of two groups: the vehicle control group (twenty-four rats) or the rhBMP-2 group (twenty-four rats). Within each group, animals were further subdivided according to the follow-up period: one week and six weeks after the lesion. For the acute phase, an additional group of four rats received recombinant human albumin, to account for the cross-species inflammatory response. Postoperatively, locomotor function was assessed on a weekly basis with use of an open field scale and digital footprint analysis. After the animals were killed, they were perfused and the spinal cords analyzed for inflammatory markers, gliosis, and extracellular matrix proteins with use of immunohistochemistry. At one week, there was a significant increase in reactive astrocyte, macrophage-microglia, and fibroblast immunoreactivity around the lesion in the rhBMP-2-treated rats relative to controls. Additionally, there was increased staining for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Similar intergroup morphologic differences persisted at six weeks. Functionally, in the acute phase, rhBMP-2-treated animals demonstrated more open field and fine motor control deficits relative to the controls. By six weeks, both groups had equivalent functional scores, but those treated with rhBMP-2 retained significantly greater paw angle changes than the control animals. Our findings indicate that in a rat model, rhBMP-2 use in the vicinity of a penetrating spinal cord injury triggers detrimental changes in the morphology of the spinal cord lesion and alters functional recovery.","albumin","pubmed"

In addition to CS chains, keratan sulfate (KS) chains are also covalently attached to some proteoglycans. CS and KS sometimes share the same core protein, but exist as independent sugar chains. However, the biological significance of KS remains elusive. Here, we addressed the question of whether KS is involved in plasticity after spinal cord injury. Keratanase II (K-II) specifically degraded KS, i.e., not CS, in vivo. This enzyme digestion promoted the recovery of motor and sensory function after spinal cord injury in rats. Consistent with this, axonal regeneration/sprouting was enhanced in K-II-treated rats. K-II and the CS-degrading enzyme chondroitinase ABC exerted comparable effects in vivo and in vitro. However, these two enzymes worked neither additively nor synergistically. These data and further in vitro studies involving artificial proteoglycans (KS/CS-albumin) and heat-denatured or reduced/alkylated proteoglycans suggested that all three components of the proteoglycan moiety, i.e., the core protein, CS chains, and KS chains, were required for the inhibitory activity of proteoglycans. We conclude that KS is essential for, and has an impact comparable to that of CS on, postinjury plasticity. Our study also established that KS and CS are independent requirements for the proteoglycan-mediated inhibition of axonal regeneration/sprouting.","albumin","pubmed"

Although Alb can promote basic recovery of motor function after iSCI, the therapeutic effect of OA or Alb-OA on a known translational measure of SCI associated with symptoms of spasticity and change in nociception has not been studied. Following T9 spinal contusion injury in Wistar rats, intrathecal treatment with: i) Saline, ii) Alb (0.4 nanomoles), iii) OA (80 nanomoles), iv) Alb-Elaidic acid (0.4/80 nanomoles), or v) Alb-OA (0.4/80 nanomoles) were evaluated on basic motor function, temporal summation of noxious reflex activity, and with a new test of descending modulation of spinal activity below the SCI up to one month after injury. Albumin, OA and Alb-OA treatment inhibited nociceptive Tibialis Anterior (TA) reflex activity. Moreover Alb-OA synergistically promoted early recovery of locomotor activity to 50 ± 10% of control and promoted de novo phasic descending inhibition of TA noxious reflex activity to 47 ± 5% following non-invasive electrical conditioning stimulation applied above the iSCI. Spinal L4-L5 immunohistochemistry demonstrated a unique increase in serotonin fibre innervation up to 4.2 ± 1.1 and 2.3 ± 0.3 fold within the dorsal and ventral horn respectively with Alb-OA treatment when compared to uninjured tissue, in addition to a reduction in NR1 NMDA receptor phosphorylation and microglia reactivity. Early recovery of voluntary motor function accompanied with tonic and de novo phasic descending inhibition of nociceptive TA flexor reflex activity following Alb-OA treatment, mediated via known endogenous spinal mechanisms of action, suggests a clinical application of this novel neurotrophic factor for the treatment of paralysis, spasticity and pain.","albumin","pubmed"

Within 24 h of compression injury, rats treated with Cx43-asODN scored higher than sense-ODN and vehicle-treated controls on behavioural tests of locomotion. Their spinal cords showed less swelling and tissue disruption, less up-regulation of astrocytic GFAP, and less extravasation of fluorescently-labelled bovine serum albumin and neutrophils. The locomotor improvement was sustained over at least 4 weeks. Following partial spinal cord transection, Cx43-asODN treatment reduced GFAP immunoreactivity, neutrophil recruitment, and the activity of OX42(+) microglia in and around the lesion site.

Normal compounds were used for comparison. SCI was produced by making a longitudinal incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-T11 segments under Equithesin anesthesia.

Topical application of normal compounds in high quantity (10 microg in 20 microL) attenuated behavioral dysfunction (3 h after trauma), edema formation, and cell injury, as well as reducing BSCB permeability to Evans blue albumin and (131)I. These beneficial effects are most pronounced with AP713 (SCI-2) treatment.

Various therapeutic molecules, including neurotrophic factors, have improved regeneration and functional recovery after injury when combined with NGCs; however, their impact has not been maximized partly due to the lack of an appropriate drug delivery system. To address this limitation, nerve growth factor (NGF) was incorporated into NGCs of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), P(HEMA-co-MMA). The NGCs were synthesized by a liquid-liquid centrifugal casting process and three different methods of protein incorporation were compared in terms of protein distribution and NGF release profile: (1) NGF was encapsulated (with BSA) in biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) 85/15 microspheres, which were combined with a PHEMA polymerization formulation and coated on the inside of pre-formed NGCs by a second liquid-liquid centrifugal casting technique; (2) pre-formed NGCs were imbibed with a solution of NGF/BSA and (3) NGF/BSA alone was combined with a PHEMA formulation and coated on the inside of pre-formed NGCs by a second liquid-liquid centrifugal casting technique. Using a fluorescently labelled model protein, the distribution of proteins in NGCs prepared with a coating of either protein-loaded microspheres or protein alone was found to be confined to the inner PHEMA layer. Sustained release of NGF was achieved from NGCs with either NGF-loaded microspheres or NGF alone incorporated into the inner layer, but not from channels imbibed with NGF. By day 28, NGCs with microspheres released a total of 220 pg NGF/cm of channel whereas those NGCs imbibed with NGF released 1040 pg/cm and those NGCs with NGF incorporated directly in a PHEMA layer released 8624 pg/cm. The release of NGF from NGCs with microspheres was limited by a slow-degrading microsphere formulation and by the maximum amount of microspheres that could be incorporated into the NGCs structure. Notwithstanding, the liquid-liquid centrifugal casting process is promising for localized and controlled release of multiple factors that are key to tissue regeneration.","albumin","pubmed"

SCI produced stereotypical sensorimotor deficits resembling the classically described Brown-Seqúard syndrome. Disruption of the BSCB was reflected by increased spinal cord uptake of radiolabeled albumin from blood; this was transient (immediately after SCI) and confined to the lumbar spinal cord. By contrast, specific increase in the entry of TNF alpha was detected in brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord at 1 week after SCI, in addition to its immediate and transient increase consistent with barrier disruption. Lack of a second peak of increase in the entry of IL1 beta further supported the specificity of the TNF alpha response. Moreover, enhanced uptake of radiolabeled TNF alpha was suppressed by excess non-radiolabeled TNF alpha, indicating competition of entry via the known transport system for TNF alpha. Therefore, upregulation of the transport system after SCI probably mediates the increased permeation of TNF alpha across the BSCB. Enhanced entry of TNF alpha at 1 week after SCI was concurrent with sensorimotor and gait improvement of the mouse. We conclude that SCI by lumbar hemisection activates the transport system for TNF alpha at the BBB and suggest that selective permeation of TNF alpha may facilitate functional recovery.","albumin","pubmed"

In this paper we demonstrate that a partially humanized, recombinant Fab fragment (rIN-1 Fab) derived from the original mAb IN-1, was able to promote long-distance regeneration of injured axons in the spinal cord of adult rats. When infused into a spinal cord injury site, regrowth of corticospinal fibers in 11 of 18 animals was observed after a survival time of 2 weeks. Regenerating fibers grew for >9 mm beyond the lesion site and arborized profusely in the distal cord. Regenerated fibers formed terminal arbors with varicosities in the spinal cord gray matter, strongly resembling synaptic points of contact to neurons in the spinal cord distal to the lesion. In animals that had received a bovine serum albumin solution or a recombinant IN-1 fragment that had been mutated in the antigen binding site (mutIN-1 Fab), no significant growth beyond normal lesion-induced sprouting was observed.

Using convection, various infusion volumes ([Vi]; 1, 2, and 4 microl) of 14C-albumin were infused into the dorsal columns of 13 naive and five traumatized rat spinal cords. Volume of distribution (Vd), homogeneity, percentage of recovery, and anatomical location were determined using quantitative autoradiography, scintillation analysis, calculation of kurtosis (K) value, and histological analysis. In the nontraumatized group, Vd was linearly proportional (R2 = 0.98) to Vi (Vd/Vi, 4.3+/-0.6; mean +/- standard deviation), with increases in Vd resulting from linear expansion (R2 = 0.94) primarily in the craniocaudal dimension. In the traumatized spinal cords, the Vd/Vi ratio (3.7+/-0.5) was smaller (p<0.02) and distributions were less confined to the craniocaudal dimension, with significantly larger cross-sectional distributions in the region of injury (p<0.02) compared to the noninjured spinal cords. Histological analysis revealed that after infusion into the dorsal columns, albumin distribution in naive cords was limited to the dorsal white matter, but in the traumatized cords there was penetration into the central gray matter. The distribution of the infusate was homogeneous in the nontraumatized (K = -1.1) and traumatized (K = -1.1) spinal cords. Recovery of radioactivity was not significantly different (p>0.05) between the nontraumatized (84.8+/-6.8%) and traumatized (79.7+/-12.1%) groups.

To test this hypothesis, rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to severe spinal cord ischemia (25 minutes) followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, at which time either vehicle, antibody against the CD11/CD18 (anti-CD) leukocyte adhesion molecule (1 mg/kg), or the anti-CD and PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (3 mg/kg), was administered intravenously and the animals were monitored for 6.5 hours.

Hindlimb motor function indicated complete paralysis during ischemia and partial gradual recovery upon reperfusion (up to 8 hours), followed by progressive deterioration to severe deficits over 48 hours. Severe vascular permeability disruption was noticed early (30 minutes) after reperfusion, but almost complete recovery reestablished at 8 hours was followed by a secondary progressive increase in vascular permeability. Blood flow was reduced by 20-30% (p less than 0.01) 4 hours after ischemia in the gray matter, but hyperemia (200-300%, p less than 0.01) was observed 12-24 hours after ischemia. Spinal cord water content increased by 5.7% (p less than 0.05) 24 hours after ischemia. This study demonstrates that delayed neurological and motor deterioration after spinal cord ischemia is associated with severe progressive breakdown of spinal cord-blood barrier integrity that develops late (hours) after the injury. Our data suggest that no ischemic insult in early or late reperfusion is associated with delayed motor deterioration.","albumin","pubmed"

All animals in the control group, group A, were completely paraplegic with 0% recovery by Tarlov criteria at 24 hours after the removal of the crossclamp. In contrast, all animals in group B, in which the combination of allopurinol and deferoxamine was used, completely recovered (100% recovery by Tarlov criteria), and at 24 hours after the ischemic episode they were able to walk with no difficulty and had intact sensation. Functional parameters of these animals fully correlated with the morphologic findings. Widespread acute neuronal injury and vacuolation of neuropil were observed in the control group of animals. In contrast, animals in group B showed much less pronounced morphologic changes after the same period of ischemia. In summary, the combined use of these agents significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the incidence of paraplegia induced by aortic crossclamping with 82% additivity.","allopurinol","pubmed"

Cochlear integrity, induction of hearing loss and functional recovery of sensory hearing loss were assessed using Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAEs). The morphological alteration and recovery of the organ of Corti was assessed histologically using the light and scanning electron microscopes. After six month duration, there was improvement in 50% of the sensorineural DPOAE results. Functional recovery coincided with the repair of structural components of organ of Corti.

In this study, we tested the effects of amiloride treatment on the fate of OPCs during secondary injury in rats. Amiloride is an FDA-approved diuretic for treating hypertension, which in rats enhances ER stress response and suppresses the apoptosis of glial cells after SCI. A severe contusive SCI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using an infinite horizon (IH)-impactor (200 kdyne). Beginning 24 h after SCI, 10 mg/kg of amiloride or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was intraperitoneally administered daily for a period of 14 days. At 7, 14, 28, and 56 days after SCI, animals were subsequently euthanized in order to analyze the injured spinal cord. We labeled proliferating OPCs and demonstrated that amiloride treatment led to greater numbers of OPCs and oligodendrocytes in the injured spinal cord. Increased myelin basic protein (MBP) expression levels were observed, suggesting that increased numbers of mature oligodendrocytes led to improved remyelination, significantly improving motor function recovery.","amiloride","pubmed"

Here, we used a rat SCI model to assess the effects of amiloride on functional recovery, secondary damage expansion, ER stress-induced cell death and OPC survival. Hindlimb function in rats with spinal cord contusion significantly improved after amiloride administration. Amiloride significantly decreased the expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP in the injured spinal cord and significantly increased the expression of the ER chaperone GRP78, which protects cells against ER stress. In addition, amiloride treatment led to a significant decrease in ER stress-induced apoptosis and a significant increase of NG2-positive OPCs in the injured spinal cord. Furthermore, in vitro experiments performed to investigate the direct effect of amiloride on OPCs revealed that amiloride reduced CHOP expression in OPCs cultured under ER stress. These results suggest that amiloride controls ER stress in SCI and inhibits cellular apoptosis, contributing to OPC survival.

It is known that spinal cord injury (SCI) induces lasting decreases in Ang-1 levels, underlying endothelial barrier disruption, but the expression of Ang-2 in spinal cord injury has not been studied. We characterized Ang-2 after SCI using a clinically relevant rat model of contusion SCI. We found that SCI induces marked and persistent upregulation of Ang-2 (up to 10 weeks after SCI), which does not reflect well-characterized temporal profile of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) breakdown after SCI, and thus suggests other role(s) for Ang-2 in injured spinal cords. Furthermore, we also found that higher Ang-2 levels were associated with more successful locomotor recovery after SCI, both in SCI rats with markedly better spontaneous motor recovery and in SCI rats receiving a neuroprotective pharmacological intervention (amiloride), suggesting a beneficial role for Ang-2 in injured spinal cords. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that Ang-2 was not induced in endothelial cells, but in perivascular and non-vascular cells labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2). Therefore, it is unlikely that induction of Ang-2 contributes to vascular dysfunction underlying functional impairment after SCI, but rather that it contributes to the beneficial pro-angiogenic and/or gliogenic processes underlying recovery processes after SCI.","amiloride","pubmed"

Dorsal column segments from adult rats (n = 87) were isolated and maintained in an in vitro recording chamber while being superfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution (95% O2/5% CO2, 25 degrees C). Selected experiments (n = 10) also were done at 33 degrees C. Compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded from microelectrodes. Injury was performed by compression of the dorsal column segment for 15 sec with a modified aneurysm clip exerting a closing force of 2 gm. With injury, the CAP decreased to 72.1 +/- 9.6% of baseline values. Removal of extracellular Na+ and replacement with the impermeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine enhanced recovery of the CAP to 98.3 +/- 18.3% (p < 0.05) of baseline. The Na+ channel blockers tetrodotoxin and procaine also improved recovery of the CAP to 96.3 +/- 23.7% (p < 0.05) and 82.8 +/- 4.6% (p < 0.05) of baseline values, respectively. In contrast, increasing Na+ permeability with veratridine resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude after 1 hr of trauma (60.1 +/- 8.4%, p < 0.05). Similarly, prevention of extrusion of Na+ from the intracellular compartment by inhibiting the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump with ouabain resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude at 1 hr after trauma (56.7 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.05). The Na(+)-H+ exchange blockers amiloride (100 microM) and harmaline (100 microM) significantly improved recovery after injury to 89.6 +/- 17.0% (p < 0.05) and 85.7 +/- 7.2% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively.

In summary, reduction of extracellular Na+ confers neuroprotection after spinal cord injury in vitro. Intracellular sodium rises appear to be mediated by voltage-gated Na+ channels. Blockade of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger also is neuroprotective, possibly by reducing intracellular acidosis. Furthermore, prevention of extrusion of intracellular Na+ by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump exacerbates the effects of compression trauma.

The cell types that primarily comprise the spinal cord are neurons and several categories of glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Ependymal cells and small populations of endogenous stem cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, also reside in the spinal cord. Neurons are interconnected in circuits; those that process cutaneous sensory input are mainly located in the dorsal spinal cord, while those involved in proprioception and motor control are predominately located in the ventral spinal cord. Due to the importance of the spinal cord, neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries affecting the spinal cord will lead to motor deficits and loss of sensory inputs.Spinal cord injury (SCI), resulting in paraplegia and tetraplegia as a result of deleterious interconnected mechanisms encompassed by the primary and secondary injury, represents a heterogeneously behavioral and cognitive deficit that remains incurable. Following SCI, various barriers containing the neuroinflammation, neural tissue defect (neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), cavity formation, loss of neuronal circuitry, and function must be overcame. Notably, the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of cell-cell communication networks play critical roles in homeostatic, driving the pathophysiologic and consequent cognitive outcomes. In the spinal cord, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia are involved in not only development but also pathology. Glial cells play dual roles (negative vs. positive effects) in these processes. After SCI, detrimental effects usually dominate and significantly retard functional recovery, and curbing these effects is critical for promoting neurological improvement. Indeed, residential innate immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) and infiltrating leukocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), activated by SCI, give rise to full-blown inflammatory cascades. These inflammatory cells release neurotoxins (proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, free radicals, excitotoxic amino acids, nitric oxide (NO)), all of which partake in axonal and neuronal deficit.Given the various multifaceted obstacles in SCI treatment, a combinatorial therapy of cell transplantation and biomaterial implantation may be addressed in detail here. For the sake of preserving damaged tissue integrity and providing physical support and trophic supply for axon regeneration, MSC transplantation has come to the front stage in therapy for SCI with the constant progress of stem cell engineering. MSC transplantation promotes scaffold integration and regenerative growth potential. Integrating into the implanted scaffold, MSCs influence implant integration by improving the healing process. Conversely, biomaterial scaffolds offer MSCs with a sheltered microenvironment from the surrounding pathological changes, in addition to bridging connection spinal cord stump and offering physical and directional support for axonal regeneration. Besides, Biomaterial scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix to suppress immune responses.Here, we review the advances in combinatorial biomaterial scaffolds and MSC transplantation approach that targets certain aspects of various intercellular communications in the pathologic process following SCI. Finally, the challenges of biomaterial-supported MSC transplantation and its future direction for neuronal regeneration will be presented.","amino_acids","pubmed"

We found that the cleavage site in this 1192-amino-acid-long fragment is located between amino acids 961-971. We also detected a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1)-interacting Nogo-66 domain on the exosome surface. Enzyme inhibitor treatment and siRNA knockdown revealed that β-secretase 1 (BACE1) is the protease responsible for Nogo-A cleavage. Functionally, exosomes with the Nogo-66 domain on their surface potently inhibited axonal regeneration of mechanically injured cerebral cortex neurons from mice. Production of this fragment was observed in the exosomal fraction from neuronal tissue lysates after spinal cord crush injury of mice. We also noted that, relative to the exosomal marker Alix, a Nogo-immunoreactive, 24-kDa protein is enriched in exosomes 2-fold after injury.

The present study tested the potential effect of the sustained activation of HIF-1α by the prolylhydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on anti-apoptotic process and the regulation of axonal regeneration after SCI. Here, we found that treatment with DMOG significantly increased the expression of HIF-1α and that the stabilization of HIF-1α induced by DMOG not only decreased the expression of apoptotic proteins to promote neural survival, but also enhanced axonal regeneration by regulating microtubule stabilization in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found that DMOG promoted neural survival and axonal regeneration by activating autophagy, which is induced by the HIF-1α/BNIP3 signaling pathway, and that the inhibition of HIF-1α or autophagy abrogated the protective effect of DMOG, as expected. Taken together, our results demonstrate that treatment with DMOG improves functional recovery after SCI and that DMOG may serve as a potential candidate for treating SCI.","amino_acids","pubmed"

Experimental suppression of neuroinflammation encourages recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI), yet practical means for pharmacologically treating SCI have remained elusive. Lanthionine ketimine (LK) is a natural brain sulfur amino acid metabolite with demonstrated anti-neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic activities. LK and its synthetic brain-penetrating ethyl ester (LKE) promote growth factor-dependent neurite extension in cultured cell and suppress microglial activation in animal models of neurodegeneration. Thus far however, LKE has not been explored as a potential therapy for SCI. The present study investigated the hypothesis that systemic LKE could improve motor functional recovery after SCI in a mouse model. Intraperitoneal administration of LKE (100 mg/kg/d) after near-complete transect of spinal cord at the T7 level significantly improved motor function over a 4-week time course. Vehicle-treated mice, in contrast, demonstrated negligible functional recovery. In terms of histology, LKE treatment reduced pro-neuroinflammatory microglia/macrophage activation evidenced by quantitative Iba1 labeling and shifted the microglial phenotype toward a more neurotrophic M2 character evidenced by changes in the M2 marker arginase-1. This was correlated with less dense scar formation and more extensive axonal regrowth across the transection site demonstrated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) immunolabeling of raphespinal tract axons. These data provide evidence that LKE or similar compounds have potential therapeutic value for recovery after certain forms of SCI.","amino_acids","pubmed"

Herein, we will review advances in the understanding of the role of several proteins of the UPS in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). The UPS consists of many factors that include E3 ubiquitin ligases, ubiquitin hydrolases, ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules, and the proteasome itself. An extensive body of work links UPS dysfunction with AD pathogenesis and progression. More recently, the UPS has been shown to have vital roles in recovery of function after SCI. The ubiquitin hydrolase (Uch-L1) has been proposed to increase cellular levels of mono-ubiquitin and hence to increase rates of protein turnover by the UPS. A low Uch-L1 level has been linked with Aβ accumulation in AD and reduced neuroregeneration after SCI. One likely mechanism for these beneficial effects of Uch-L1 is reduced turnover of the PKA regulatory subunit and consequently, reduced signaling via CREB. The neuron-specific F-box protein Fbx2 ubiquitinates β-secretase thus targeting it for proteasomal degradation and reducing generation of Aβ. Both Uch-L1 and Fbx2 improve synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in mouse AD models. The role of Fbx2 after SCI has not been examined, but abolishing ß-secretase reduces neuronal recovery after SCI, associated with reduced myelination. UBB+1, which arises through a frame-shift mutation in the ubiquitin gene that adds 19 amino acids to the C-terminus of ubiquitin, inhibits proteasomal function and is associated with increased neurofibrillary tangles in patients with AD, Pick's disease and Down's syndrome. These advances in understanding of the roles of the UPS in AD and SCI raise new questions but, also, identify attractive and exciting targets for potential, future therapeutic interventions.","amino_acids","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury causes tissue damage in two successive waves. The initial injury is mechanical and directly causes primary tissue damage, which induces subsequent ischemia, inflammation, and neurotoxic factor release resulting in the secondary tissue damage. These lead to activation of glial cells. Activated glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes are common pathological observations in the damaged lesion. Activated microglia release glutamate, the major neurotoxic factor released into the extracellular space after neural injury, which causes neuronal death at high concentration. In the present study, we demonstrate that reduction of glutamate-mediated exitotoxicity via intraperitoneal administration of INI-0602 in the microenvironment of the injured spinal cord elicited neurobehavioral recovery and extensive suppression of glial scar formation by reducing secondary tissue damage. Further, this intervention stimulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, and subsequently elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, preventing microglial activation by a gap junction hemichannel blocker, INI-0602, may be a promising therapeutic strategy in spinal cord injury.","amino_acids","pubmed"

Cerebrolysin is a neuropeptide preparation which mimics the action of endogenous neurotrophic factors on brain protection and repair. In dementia models, Cerebrolysin decreases β-amyloid deposition and microtubule-associated protein tau phosphorylation by regulating glycogen synthase kinase-3β and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activity, increases synaptic density and restores neuronal cytoarchitecture. These effects protect integrity of the neuronal circuits and thus result in improved cognitive and behavioral performance. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin enhances neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, the basis for neuronal replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental studies in stroke animal models have shown that Cerebrolysin stabilizes the structural integrity of cells by inhibition of calpain and reduces the number of apoptotic cells after ischemic lesion. Cerebrolysin induces restorative processes, decreases infarct volume and edema formation and promotes functional recovery. Stroke-induced neurogenesis in the subventricular zone was also promoted by Cerebrolysin, thus supporting the brain's self-repair after stroke. Both, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury conditions stimulate the expression of natural neurotrophic factors to promote repair and regeneration processes -axonal regeneration, neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis- that is considered to be crucial for the future recovery. Neuroprotective effects of Cerebrolysin on experimentally induced traumatic spinal cord injury have shown that Cerebrolysin prevents apoptosis of lesioned motoneurons and promotes functional recovery. This section summarizes the most relevant data on the pharmacology of Cerebrolysin obtained from in vitro assays (biochemical and cell cultures) and in vivo animal models of acute and chronic neurological disorders.","amino_acids","pubmed"

Promoting structural plasticity may become an important component of future strategies to improve functional outcomes. We have recently observed dynamic changes in the density and morphology of dendritic spines in the motor cortex following SCI. The present study sought to test whether SCI-induced changes in spine density and morphology could be modulated by potential strategies to enhance functional recovery. We examined the effects of enriched environment, transplants, and neurotrophin-3 on the plasticity of synaptic structures in the motor cortex following SCI. Housing rats in an enriched environment increased spine density in the motor cortex regardless of injury. SCI led to a more slender and elongated spine morphology. Enriched housing mitigated the SCI-induced morphological alterations, suggesting that the environmental modification facilitates maturation of synaptic structures. Transplantation of embryonic spinal cord tissue and delivery of neurotrophin-3 at the injury site further increased spine density when combined with enriched housing. This combinatorial treatment completely abolished the injury-induced changes, restoring a preinjury pattern of spine morphology. These results demonstrated that remodeling of dendritic spines in the motor cortex after SCI can be modulated by enriched housing, and the combinatorial treatment with embryonic transplants and neurotrophin-3 can potentiate the effects of enriched housing. We suggest that synaptic remodeling processes in the motor cortex can be targeted for an intervention to enhance functional recovery after SCI.","amino_acids","pubmed"

The present study determined whether SCI leads to a remodeling of synaptic structures in the motor cortex. Dendritic spines in the rat motor cortex were visualized by confocal microscopy in fixed slices, and their density and morphology were analyzed after an overhemisection injury at C4 level. Spine density decreased at 7 days and partially recovered by 28 days. Spine head diameter significantly increased in a layer-specific manner. SCI led to a higher proportion of longer spines especially at 28 days, resulting in a roughly 10% increase in mean spine length. In addition, filopodium-like long dendritic protrusions were more frequently observed after SCI, suggesting an increase in synaptogenic events. This spine remodeling was accompanied by increased expression of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, which attenuates adhesion between the pre- and postsynaptic membranes, in the motor cortex from as early as 3 days to 2 weeks after injury, suggesting a decrease in synaptic adhesion during the remodeling process. These results demonstrate time-dependent changes in spine density and morphology in the motor cortex following SCI. This synaptic remodeling seems to proceed with a time scale ranging from days to weeks. Elongation of dendritic spines may indicate a more immature and modifiable pattern of synaptic connectivity in the motor cortex being reorganized following SCI.","amino_acids","pubmed"

To avoid this dreadful complication, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been examined in the ischemic or excitotoxic neuronal injury model. In the present study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of NMDA receptor antagonists that were infused segmentally after aortic clamping, as a spinoplegia, to reduce aspartate neurotoxicity in the spinal cord. Infrarenal aortic isolation was performed in New Zealand white rabbits. Group A animals (n = 7) were pretreated with the segmental infusion of MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, followed by segmental aspartate (50 mmol) infusion for 10 minutes. Group B animals (n = 6) received pretreatment with CGS19755, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, followed by the same aspartate infusion as group A. Group C animals (n = 7) received vehicle only, followed by aspartate infusion as a control group. In addition, group D animals (n = 6) were pretreated with MK-801 that was administrated intravenously 1 hour before aspartate infusion. Neurologic status was assessed at 12, 24, and 48 hours after operation by using the Tarlov score. The spinal cords were procured at 48 hours for histopathologic analysis to determine the extent of excitotoxic neuronal injury. Most of the animals in groups A and D revealed full recovery or mild motor disturbance. Group B and C animals exhibited paraplegia or paraparesis with marked neuronal necrosis. In the Tarlov score at 48 hours, group A animals represented better neurologic function than group C (P < .01) and similar motor function to group D animals. Severe histopathologic change was not observed in groups A and D. Animals in groups A and D showed a greater number of motor neurons than animals in groups B and C (P < .01). The difference could be due to chance between group A and D animals (P = .08). These results showed that the segmental infusion of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist as an intraoperative spinoplegia could have a protective effect on the spinal cord neurons against excitotoxic neuronal injury in vivo. On the other hand, efficacy of the use of competitive antagonist was suggested to be limited in this model, probably because of the insurmountable obstacle of the blood-brain barrier. Paraplegia is a devastating complication during surgical repair of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortas. Excitatory amino acids neurotoxicity through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is no doubt the pathologic hallmark of ischemic and postischemic spinal cord injury. Systemic administration of either a competitive or noncompetitive NMDA antagonist has been reported to have neuroprotective effect, in terms of preoperative treatment, with dose-related central sympathomimetic and sedative effects. Local administration, particularly of a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, infused segmentally after aortic clamping could therefore be a potent intraoperative pharmacologic strategy to minimize the effective dose that retains NMDA antagonism without undesirable adverse effects. Our ability to reproduce this model could facilitate pharmacologic prevention or provide a new surgical technique as a spinoplegia for NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal injury.","amino_acids","pubmed"

In this experimental study, the time-level relationship of the nitric oxide and the neuroprotective effects of aminoguanidine were investigated in a rat spinal cord trauma model. The experiments were performed on 63 Wistar albino rats divided into three groups; sham-operated control (Group 1), trauma created control (Group 2) and aminoguanidine group (Group 3). In groups 2 and 3, spinal cord trauma was produced at thoracic level by using weight the drop technique (at a severity of 50 gr-cm). After the trauma, the rats in Group 3, received an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg aminoquanidine twice a day for 3 days. The effects of the injury and the efficacy of aminoguanidine were determined based on biochemical parameters (lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels in tissue), and on light microscopy findings in cord tissue collected at different times post-injury. Biochemical parameters were performed one hour, three and five days after injury. Functional recovery was assessed at 3, and 5 days after cord trauma with the inclined-plane technique and Tarlov's motor grading scale. Although there was no statistically significant difference at the 1(st) hour, the values of the tissue nitric oxide in trauma created controls were 42% higher on the 3(rd) day and 40% higher on the 5(th) day when compared with those in sham controls. The levels of the tissue lipid peroxidation in trauma created controls were 88% higher at the 1(st) hour and 52.8% higher on the 5(th) day when compared with shame controls, but there was no meaningful difference on the 3(rd) day. In the trauma created control group, the mean motor function scores decreased to 1.16 +/- 0.40 and to 1 +/- 0 on the 3(rd) and 5(th) day, respectively. In this group the mean values of the inclined plane were 39.16 +/- 2.04 on the 3(rd) day and 37.91 +/- 1.02 on the 5(th) day. No statistically significant difference was observed in both tissue lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels for all time points between the aminoguanidine group and the sham-operated controls (p>0.01). The motor function scores were observed as 2.16 +/- 0.40 on the 3(rd) day and as 3 +/- 0 on the 5(th) day in aminoguanidine group. These values were significantly higher than the trauma created controls (p<0.01). Aminoguanidin treatment also improved the inclined plane performance of the rats; In this group, the mean values of the inclined plane scores were 44.58 +/- 2.92 and 52.91 +/- 1.88 on the 3(rd) and 5(th) days, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the trauma created controls (p<0.01). This study shows that the nitric oxide level does not increase in the spinal cord tissue during the first hour after the spinal cord trauma. It increases significantly in the spinal cord tissue not only three days but also five days following the trauma. Aminoguanidine treatment, which is started just after the trauma, can prevent both the nitric oxide production and lipid peroxidation in spinal cord tissue and it can improve the functional status of the animals. In this respect, aminoguanidine may have a potential role in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.","amino_acids","pubmed"

The protective effects of a variety of competitive and non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists indicate that activation of the NMDA receptor complex is essential for dynorphin A-induced spinal cord injury. 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC) is a high affinity, partial agonist at strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors associated with the NMDA receptor complex. Pretreatment of rats with ACPC (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior to dynorphin A) significantly eliminated the persistent hindlimb motor deficits and neuropathological changes produced by 20 nmol of this peptide. The neuroprotective effects of ACPC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) were abolished by parenteral administration of glycine (800 mg/kg, 30 min prior to ACPC), consistent with other in vivo and in vitro studies indicating that the pharmacological actions of ACPC are effected through strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors. When given instead as six daily injections (200 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by an injection-free day, ACPC also significantly improved neurological recovery following dynorphin-A injection.

NMDA receptor antagonists significantly improved recovery from dynorphin A-induced hindlimb paralysis, and substantially eliminated neuropathological changes without attenuating the acute blood flow reductions or lactic acid elevations. Additionally, glutamate and aspartate concentrations were increased significantly in spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid samples removed during the time that peptide-induced spinal cord blood flow reductions were observed. In contrast, neither amino acid concentration was elevated in media removed after 1-hr exposure of spinal cord neuronal cell cultures to 100 microM concentrations of dynorphin A. These results indicate that the paralysis and spinal cord injuries produced in rats after spinal subarachnoid injection of dynorphin A result predominantly from spinal cord ischemia, and further identify excitatory amino acids and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mechanisms as important mediators in this injury model.","amino_acids","pubmed"

Microdialysis was performed during continuous epidural SCS in animals subjected to ischemic spinal cord injury. Recovery of amino acid neurotransmitters from stimulated, injured animals was compared to that from a control group. Evoked potentials from the cortex and spinal cord were recorded to insure adequate stimulation and stable cord function. A significant increase in the concentrations of glycine and taurine was seen before, during, and after 90 minutes of continuous stimulation and was independent of the degree of injury. Levels of the other putative amino acid neurotransmitters were not significantly elevated.

Levels of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter amino acids [gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, aspartate, glycine, taurine] and levels of nonneurotransmitter amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, alanine, threonine, serine) were determined at 5 min, 4 h, and 24 h posttrauma.

In injured animals, the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate were significantly decreased by 5 min posttrauma, and remained depressed at 4 h and 24 h as compared with corresponding laminectomy controls. In contrast, the inhibitory amino acids, glycine, GABA, and taurine, were decreased at 5 min postinjury, had partially recovered at 4 h, and were almost fully recovered at 24 h. The nonneurotransmitter amino acids were unchanged at 5 min posttrauma and significantly increased at 4 h, with partial recovery at 24 h.

Increased work of breathing, mechanical disadvantage, neuromuscular disease, impaired nutritional status, shock, hypoxemia, acidosis, and deficiency of potassium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphorus are the major non-neurologic factors which contribute to respiratory muscle fatigue and failure. Respiratory muscle fatigue has two components. High frequency fatigue occurs rapidly with intense contractile efforts but is usually not severe. It also recovers rapidly with rest. Low frequency fatigue develops more slowly but is severe and requires hours for recovery. Since the spontaneous rate of neural stimulation is predominantly in the low frequency range, this component of fatigue is of particular clinical importance. Fatigue of the inspiratory muscles leads to acute respiratory acidosis, but before carbon dioxide retention occurs, it can be recognized from characteristic symptoms and signs. These include dyspnea which responds to mechanical ventilation, rapid shallow breathing, and asynchronous movements of the chest and abdomen. Inspiratory muscle fatigue must be treated by putting these muscles to rest, by mechanically supporting ventilation. In addition, underlying metabolic nutritional and circulatory abnormalities must be corrected and infection treated. Aminophylline and isoproterenol can restore inspiratory muscle contractility, but controlled clinical trials remain to be done regarding their application in acute and chronic respiratory failure. Inspiratory muscle training improves strength and endurance in patients with obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord injury, but does not always improve physical exercise performance. Again, more work is needed to develop the indications for inspiratory muscle training and to determine the optimum type and duration of the training regimen.","aminophylline","pubmed"

At 24 h post-SCI, there was a massive loss of motor function and cysts formation in the spinal cord. The SCI mice, following 3 days and onwards, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the population and hypertrophy of GFAP + astrocytes, suggesting the occurrence of reactive astrogliosis. Intra-fourth ventricular administration of CART (54-102) or intravenous treatment with MP, dose dependently improved motor function score, while CART-antibody (intra-fourth ventricular) was ineffective. This neuroprotective effect of MP was potentiated by the subeffective dose of CART and antagonized by CART-antibody. CART or MP treatment not only prevented the cysts formation, but also significantly attenuated the population of GFAP + astrocytes at days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-SCI and the hypertrophy of astrocytes at day 14 and 28. The histological consequence of SCI, like cysts formation in the spinal cord, was rapidly improved by CART and/or MP.

Here, we investigated whether this same drug/training regimen could enhance functional recovery following either thoracic (T9) or cervical (C5) spinal cord injury. Different groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a beam walking task, and in a straight alley for assessment of hindlimb locomotor recovery using the BBB locomotor scale. For rats that received C5 hemisections, forelimb grip strength was assessed using a grip strength meter. Three separate experiments assessed the consequences of training rats on the beam walking task 24 h following a thoracic lateral hemisection with administration of either amphetamine or saline. Beginning 1 h following drug administration, rats either received additional testing/retraining on the beam hourly for 6 h, or they were returned to their home cages without further testing/retraining. Rats with thoracic spinal cord injuries that received amphetamine in conjunction with testing/retraining on the beam at 1 day post injury (DPI) exhibited significantly impaired recovery on the beam walking task and BBB. Rats with cervical spinal cord injuries that received training with amphetamine also exhibited significant impairments in beam walking and locomotion, as well as impairments in gripping and reaching abilities. Even when administered at 14 DPI, the drug/training regimen significantly impaired reaching ability in cervical spinal cord injured rats. Impairments were not seen in rats that received amphetamine without training. Histological analyses revealed that rats that received training with amphetamine had significantly larger lesions than saline controls. These data indicate that an amphetamine/training regimen that improves recovery after cortical injury has the opposite effect of impairing recovery following spinal cord injury because early training with amphetamine increases lesion severity.","amphetamine","pubmed"

Kinematics provided no evidence that improved function was related to improved quality of reach. There was no evidence of neuroprotection in the cervical spinal cord.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate if, like 5HT, endogenous sources of norepinephrine (NE) facilitate motoneuron PICs after chronic spinal transection. Cutaneous-evoked reflex responses in tail muscles of awake chronic spinal rats were measured after increasing presynaptic release of NE by administration of amphetamine. An increase in long-lasting reflexes, known to be mediated by the calcium component of the PIC (CaPIC), was observed even at low doses (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) of amphetamine. These findings were repeated in a reduced S2 in vitro preparation, demonstrating that the increased long-lasting reflexes by amphetamine were neural. Under intracellular voltage clamp, amphetamine application led to a large facilitation of the motoneuron CaPIC. This indicates that the increases in long-lasting reflexes induced by amphetamine in the awake animal were, in part, due to actions directly on the motoneuron. Reflex responses in acutely spinal animals were facilitated by amphetamine similar to chronic animals but only at doses that were ten times greater than that required in chronic animals (0.2 mg/kg chronic vs. 2.0 mg/kg acute), pointing to a development of supersensitivity to endogenous NE in chronic animals. In summary, the increases in long-lasting reflexes and associated motoneuron CaPICs by amphetamine are likely due to an increased release of endogenous NE, which motoneurons become supersensitive to in the chronic stages of spinal cord injury.","amphetamine","pubmed"

Grafting OEC or astrocytes alone had no effects.

Comparable results were observed in a co-culture system where OEC promoted dopamine cell survival and neurite elongation through a mechanism involving both releasable factors and direct contact.

In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5 mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6 h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6 weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interleukin-1beta/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression - a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.","atorvastatin","pubmed"

We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 +/- 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 +/- 1.22).

While the alternative, anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype is believed to promote cell protection, regeneration, and plasticity, pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages persist after SCI and contribute to protracted cell and tissue loss. Thus, identifying non-invasive, clinically viable, pharmacological therapies for altering macrophage phenotype is a challenging, yet promising, approach for treating SCI. Azithromycin (AZM), a commonly used macrolide antibiotic, drives anti-inflammatory macrophage activation in rodent models of inflammation and in humans with cystic fibrosis. We hypothesized that AZM treatment can alter the macrophage response to SCI and reduce progressive tissue pathology. To test this hypothesis, mice (C57BL/6J, 3-month-old) received daily doses of AZM (160 mg/kg) or vehicle treatment via oral gavage for 3 days prior and up to 7 days after a moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI (75-kdyn force injury). Fluorescent-activated cell sorting was used in combination with real-time PCR (rtPCR) to evaluate the disposition and activation status of microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils, as well as macrophage phenotype in response to AZM treatment. An open-field locomotor rating scale (Basso Mouse Scale) and gridwalk task were used to determine the effects of AZM treatment on SCI recovery. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were used to determine the effect of AZM treatment on macrophage phenotype in vitro. In accordance with our hypothesis, SCI mice exhibited significantly increased anti-inflammatory and decreased pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in response to AZM treatment. In addition, AZM treatment led to improved tissue sparing and recovery of gross and coordinated locomotor function. Furthermore, AZM treatment altered macrophage phenotype in vitro and lowered the neurotoxic potential of pro-inflammatory, M1 macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that pharmacologically intervening with AZM can alter SCI macrophage polarization toward a beneficial phenotype that, in turn, may potentially limit secondary injury processes. Given that pro-inflammatory macrophage activation is a hallmark of many neurological pathologies and that AZM is non-invasive and clinically viable, these data highlight a novel approach for treating SCI and other maladaptive neuroinflammatory conditions.","azithromycin","pubmed"

Azithromycin (AZM), an FDA approved macrolide antibiotic, has been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory properties in a variety of inflammatory conditions. Indeed, we previously observed that post-SCI AZM treatment reduces pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Further, a combined pre- and post-injury treatment paradigm improved functional recovery from SCI. Therefore, for the current study, we hypothesize that post-injury AZM treatment will improve recovery from SCI. To test this hypothesis, we examined the therapeutic potential of delayed AZM treatment on locomotor, sensory, and anatomical recovery. We administered AZM beginning 30-min, 3-h, or 24-h following contusion SCI in female mice, and then daily for 7 days. AZM administration beginning 30-min and 3-h post-injury improved locomotor recovery with increased stepping function relative to vehicle controls. Further, delaying treatment for 30-min after SCI significantly reduced lesion pathology. Initiating AZM treatment 24-h post-injury was not therapeutically effective. Regardless of the timing of the initial treatment, AZM did not statistically reduce the development of neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia) nor increase neuron survival. Collectively, these results add to a growing body of evidence supporting AZM's translational potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI and other neuroinflammatory conditions in which patients currently have very few options.","azithromycin","pubmed"

The main outcome measure was neurologic status, which was assessed over 52 weeks with ""marked recovery"" defined as the conversion to higher sensory and motor function. To complete the drug safety profile, drug toxicity was assessed with assays from standard blood work. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of the cohort (n = 651), 18% (n = 115) received baclofen within 4 weeks post injury. Baclofen use was associated with higher rates of marked neurologic recovery, even after adjustment for injury severity (HR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0 for high dose vs none). Baclofen exposure was not associated with liver or renal side effects. The use of other medications indicated for spasticity was not associated with neurological outcomes. Overall, this longitudinal analysis provides level 3 evidence on the neurologic safety of baclofen and potential beneficial effects on recovery in the early days after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The usefulness of concomitant medication files from completed clinical trials is highlighted.

Thus, it is of crucial importance to find ways to promote axonal regeneration. In addition, the prevention of retrograde degeneration leading to the atrophy/death of descending neurons is an obvious prerequisite to activate axonal regeneration. Lampreys show an amazing regenerative capacity after SCI. Recent histological work in lampreys suggested that GABA, which is massively released after a SCI, could promote the survival of descending neurons. Here, we aimed to study if GABA, acting through GABAB receptors, promotes the survival and axonal regeneration of descending neurons of larval sea lampreys after a complete SCI. First, we used in situ hybridization to confirm that identifiable descending neurons of late-stage larvae express the gabab1 subunit of the GABAB receptor. We also observed an acute increase in the expression of this subunit in descending neurons after SCI, which further supported the possible role of GABA and GABAB receptors in promoting the survival and regeneration of these neurons. So, we performed gain and loss of function experiments to confirm this hypothesis. Treatments with GABA and baclofen (GABAB agonist) significantly reduced caspase activation in descending neurons 2 weeks after a complete SCI. Long-term treatments with GABOB (a GABA analogue) and baclofen significantly promoted axonal regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. These data indicate that GABAergic signalling through GABAB receptors promotes the survival and regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. Finally, we used morpholinos against the gabab1 subunit to knockdown the expression of the GABAB receptor in descending neurons. Long-term morpholino treatments caused a significant inhibition of axonal regeneration. This shows that endogenous GABA promotes axonal regeneration after a complete SCI in lampreys by activating GABAB receptors.","baclofen","pubmed"

The next morning he had a generalized-tonic-clonic seizure followed by cardiac arrest, with return of spontaneous circulation following resuscitation.

With strict blood pressure (BP) control, there was resolution of visual abnormalities, headaches, encephalopathy, and seizures. Although PRES has been most commonly described in malignant hypertension, it can be seen in patients with normotension or moderate hypertension who have low baseline BPs, such as patients with SCI. These patients are prone to AD due to imbalanced sympathetic outflow to vasculature below the level of injury caused by noxious stimulus. This results in massive regional vasoconstriction leading to an uncontrolled rise in BP above baseline. This episode of PRES could have been prevented by identifying patient's risk, recognizing early signs and potential triggers of AD, and implementing aggressive treatment of the underlying noxious stimuli.","baclofen","pubmed"

Previous work has described adaptations in spinal systems that might underlie this hyperexcitability, including an increase in constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors in spinal motoneurons. That work, however, examined adaptations following complete transection SCI, whereas SCI in humans is usually anatomically and functionally incomplete. We therefore evaluated whether constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors contributes to reflex hyperexcitability in an incomplete compression model of SCI and to spasms in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm that 5-HT2C receptor constitutive activity contributes to reflex excitability after incomplete SCI. We also evaluated whether constitutive activity could be altered by manipulation of neural activity levels after SCI, testing the hypothesis that it reflects homeostatic processes acting to maintain spinal excitability. We decreased neural activity after SCI by administering baclofen and increased activity by administering the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. We found that drug administration produced minimal alterations in in vivo locomotor function or reflex excitability. Similarly, we found that neither baclofen nor fluoxetine altered the contribution of constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors to reflexes after SCI, although the contribution of 5-HT2C receptors to reflex activity was altered after SSRIs. These results confirm the importance of constitutive activity in 5-HT2C receptors to spinal hyperexcitability following SCI in the clinically relevant case of incomplete SCI but suggest that this activity is not driven by homeostatic processes that act to maintain overall levels of spinal excitability.NEW & NOTEWORTHY After spinal cord injury (SCI), most people will develop muscle spasms below their level of injury that can severely impact function.

The degree of consciousness varies from coma to vegetative state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state. Correct diagnosis has important ethical and legal implications, and pain may be cause of misdiagnosis. We describe here a patient with traumatic brain injury, classified as UWS. His clinical picture was dominated by spasticity, and pain. He underwent intrathecal treatment of spasticity with baclofen. Improvement was not that expected. However, there was a dramatic improvement when ziconotide was added to relieve pain; the patient began to eat by mouth, talk, and his tracheal tube could be removed and he is currently classified as having severe disability. The suspension of ziconotide caused a clear re-worsening of clinical condition, reverted by his reintroduction. Pain is an important factor in patients with DOC. Anecdotal reports of improved consciousness with intrathecal baclofen therapy may be due to pain relief. Reduction of pain in DOC is important and drugs should not interfere with cognition, and must be effective and manageable.

To further understand changes in excitatory and inhibitory brainstem interneuronal circuits following SCI, we studied recovery curves of the blink reflex (BR) to paired suprathreshold stimuli at various intervals (160, 300, 500, and 1000 msec), and prepulse inhibition of the BR following right index finger stimulation 100 msec prior to supraorbital nerve stimulation. Both parameters were studied in patients with SCI without baclofen treatment (n = 19), in patients with continuous intrathecal baclofen (CITB) (n = 9), and in healthy controls (n = 13). R2 recovery, expressed as the ratio of R2 area following the second stimulus divided by the R2 area following the first stimulus, was significantly greater in SCI patients without baclofen compared to controls and patients with CITB at all intervals, while there was no difference between patients with CITB and controls. Prepulse inhibition of R2 was significantly less in patients without baclofen compared to patients with CITB and healthy controls. Our findings indicate enhanced excitability and reduced inhibition of brainstem interneuronal circuits in patients with SCI, that are restored in the presence of baclofen to levels comparable to controls. In conclusion, SCI patients show more extended alterations in brainstem circuitry than previously thought. Decreased GABAergic mechanisms seem to be related to both excitatory and inhibitory brainstem circuit alterations. Baclofen appears to effectively restore this decreased GABAeregic activity.","baclofen","pubmed"

Because the half-life time of GABA is very short in vivo, GABA itself is not used for clinical practice. An analogue of GABA, baclofen, is an agonist of GABA-B receptor, and has very strong antispastic effect by acting to the posterior horn of the spinal cord. However, baclofen poorly crosses through the blood brain barrier, and the antispastic effect is modest when administered orally. Therefore, direct continuous infusion of small doses of baclofen into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal baclofen therapy, ITB) has become an established treatment for control of otherwise intractable severe spasticity. Spasticity is clinically defined as hypertonic state of the muscles with increased tendon reflexes, muscles spasm, spasm pain, abnormal posture, and limitation of involuntary movements. Spasticity is a common symptom after damage mainly to the pyramidal tract system in the brain or the spinal cord. Such damage is caused by traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and so on. Patients in persistent vegetative state (PVS) usually have diffuse and widespread damage to the brain, spasticity is generally seen in such patients. Control of spasticity may become important in the management of PVS patients in terms of nursing care, pain relief, and hygiene, and ITB may be indicated. Among PVS patients who had ITB to control spasticity, sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from PVS after ITB have been reported worldwide. The mechanism of such recovery of consciousness is poorly understood, and it may simply be a coincidence. On the other hand, electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been tried for many years in many patients in PVS, and some positive effects on recovery of consciousness have been reported. SCS is usually indicated for control of neuropathic pain, but it has also antispastic effect. The mechanism of SCS on pain is known to be mediated through the spinal GABA neuronal system. Thus, ITB and SCS have a common background, spinal GABA neuronal mechanism. The effect of GABA agonists on recovery of consciousness is not yet established, but review of such case studies becomes a clue to solve problems in PVS, and there may be hidden serendipity.","baclofen","pubmed"

The patients were subdivided into two categories according to the aetiology of spasticity: 15 had Multiple Sclerosis and seven had suffered a Spinal Cord Injury at different levels (from C4 to T11). Clinical status was assessed with the Ashworth and Penn spasm scales. Functional benefits were evaluated with the Barthel index score and pain relief with a self-reported visual analogue pain scale. Postoperatively, all patients presented improvement in spasticity, reduction of spasm frequency, significant improvement in functional status, enhancement of life comfort and reduction of pain.

The recent National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) showed that very high dose methylprednisolone given within 8 hr after injury improves neurologic recovery. The mechanism is believed to be inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Many other drugs have been claimed to be beneficial in animal studies, including other lipid peroxidation inhibitors, free radical scavengers, opiate receptor blockers, NMDA receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, and protease inhibitors. In chronic spinal cord injury, much progress also has been made. Myelin was found to possess factors that inhibit axonal regeneration. Blocking these factors enhances spinal cord regeneration. Monosialic gangliosides (GM1) were recently found to improve neurologic recovery in spinal-cord-injured patients. Given as late as 48-72 hr after injury, the mechanism of action is not well understood. However, the GM1 results give hope that recovery mechanisms can be manipulated pharmacologically. Nonregenerative therapy for chronic spinal cord injury is also being developed. Several drugs, including 4-aminopyridine and baclofen, respectively blockers of potassium channels and GABA-B receptors, improve conduction in demyelinated axons. These drugs may be useful for identifying patients who might benefit from remyelination therapy. Finally, NASCIS has complicated acute spinal cord injury studies. To bring a drug to clinical trial, an investigator must now determine the optimal treatment dose, timing, and duration over a range of injury severities, in comparison and combination with methylprednisolone. This requirement has so increased the scale of drug testing that multicenter laboratory trials may be necessary.","baclofen","pubmed"

Rarefaction of vessels was detectable at the injury site 2 days after SCI before they disappeared in the developing cavity after 2 and 4 weeks, whereas no changes were observed in the penumbra. Investigation of the temporal expression of angiogenic genes using quantitative RT-PCR disclosed a constant down-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and transient decreases of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), as well as placental growth factor (PlGF), with the lowest values obtained 3 days after injury, when compared to the expression levels obtained in sham-operated rats. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the only angiogenic factor with a constant increased gene expression when compared with controls, starting at day 3 post-SCI. mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) were elevated at every time point following SCI, whereas those encoding for the cysteine-rich protein CCN1/CYR61 were upregulated after 2 h, 6 h, and 1 week only.

It is clinically recognized as a phenomenon of velocity-dependent increase in resistance, i.e., hypertonia. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of spasticity improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying this complex phenomenon and its relations to other components of UMN syndrome (weakness and disordered motor control), as well as the resultant clinical problems. This theoretical framework provides a foundation to set up treatment goals and to guide goal-oriented clinical assessment and treatment. Among a spectrum of treatment options, botulinum toxin (BoNT) therapy is the preferred treatment for focal spasticity. The evidence is very robust that BoNT therapy effectively reduces spasticity; however, it does not improve voluntary movement. In this chapter, we highlight a few issues on how to achieve the best clinical outcomes of BoNT therapy, such as dosing, dilution, guidance techniques, adjunctive therapies, early treatment, repeated injections, and central effects, as well as the ways to improve motor function in selected subgroups of patients with spasticity. We also discuss the reasons of poor responses to BoNT therapy and when not to use BoNT therapy.","botulinum_toxin","pubmed"

In this open label study, we aim to evaluate the effect of the BoNT-A on the spinal nociception in patients affected by spasticity of the lower limbs with associated pain with predominantly neuropathic features. Ten patients with stroke, 10 with multiple sclerosis and 5 with spinal cord injury were enrolled in the study. They were tested with clinical scales (neuropathic pain scale inventory (NPSI), numerical rating scale (NRS), modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and with the nociceptive withdrawal reflex at lower limbs to explore the spinal temporal summation threshold at baseline and 30 day after BoNT-A injection. OnabotulinumtoxinA (50 to 200 units per site) was injected in the lower limb muscles according to the distribution of spasticity. No significant differences were found at baseline for neurophysiological features across groups. After the BoNT-A injection, we recorded a significant reduction in MAS and NRS scores. Regarding the neurophysiological parameters, we described a significant increase in the temporal summation threshold after the BoNT-A injection. Our data supports the hypothesis that peripherally injected OnabotulinumtoxinA modulates the excitability of spinal cord nociceptive pathways.

We found that treadmill training allowed the retention of hind limb motor function after incomplete SCI, even with a heavy load after complete spinal transection. Moreover, treadmill training alleviated the secondary injury in distal lumbar spinal motor neurons, and enhanced BDNF/TrkB expression in the lumbar spinal cord. To discover the influence of skeletal muscle contractile activity on motor function and gene expression, we adopted botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to block the neuromuscular activity of the rat gastrocnemius muscle.

Neuropathic pain (NP) results from a dysfunction and derangement in the transmission and signal processing along the nervous system and it is a recognized disease in itself. The prevalence of NP is estimated to be between 6.9% and 10% in the general population. This condition can complicate the recovery from stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord lesions, and several neuropathies promoting persistent disability and poor quality of life. Subjects suffering from NP describe it as burning, itching, lancing, and numbness, but hyperalgesia and allodynia represent the most bothersome symptoms. The management of NP is a clinical challenge and several non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions have been proposed with variable benefits. Botulinum toxin (BTX) as an adjunct to other interventions can be a useful therapeutic tool for the treatment of disabled people. Although BTX-A is predominantly used to reduce spasticity in a neuro-rehabilitation setting, it has been used in several painful conditions including disorders characterized by NP. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms that operate in reducing pain are still unclear and include blocking nociceptor transduction, the reduction of neurogenic inflammation by inhibiting neural substances and neurotransmitters, and the prevention of peripheral and central sensitization. Some neurological disorders requiring rehabilitative intervention can show neuropathic pain resistant to common analgesic treatment. This paper addresses the effect of BTX-A in treating NP that complicates frequent disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system such as spinal cord injury, post-stroke shoulder pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy, which are commonly managed in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, BTX-A has an effect in relief pain that may characterize less common neurological disorders including post-traumatic neuralgia, phantom limb, and complex regional pain syndrome with focal dystonia. The use of BTX-A could represent a novel therapeutic strategy in caring for neuropathic pain whenever common pharmacological tools have been ineffective. However, large and well-designed clinical trials are needed to recommend BTX-A use in the relief of neuropathic pain.","botulinum_toxin","pubmed"

But what are the prospects for quadriplegics? Certain fundamental issues make treatment approaches to quadriplegia different and difficult. Injury at cervical region poses additional problems for any surgical intervention with life-threatening risks of i) endangering respiratory function, ii) cavitation, cysts, and syringomyelia formation extending cephalad to the injury, and iii) mid-lower cervical injuries, lower motor neuron death, and the resultant degeneration of brachial plexus axons would still leave the upper limbs denervated and paralyzed even as treatment procedures might successfully salvage the lower limbs. With these apparently insurmountable impediments in quadriplegic cord repair, it would be wise to turn to alternative treatment strategies. Conventional treatment models since the days of Ralph Gerard (1940) have all used intra-vertebral procedures. We present here a plausible extra-vertebral repair model suitable for incomplete cord injuries at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. The procedure consists of identifying the extent of viable grey-white matter in the injured area and to utilize it efficiently as a ""neural tissue bridge."" Next, labile state is induced by using botulinum toxin/colchicine (Krishnan, 1983, 1991; Krishnan et al., 2001 a,b) and Ca+ channel blockers in the motorsensory nerve terminals of polisegmentally innervated skeletal muscles that ""bridge"" the injured cord segments.

The action of GABA depends on the intracellular chloride concentration, which is determined largely by the expression of two cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), KCC2 and NKCC1, which serve as chloride exporters and importers, respectively. We hypothesized that the reduction in hyperreflexia with exercise after SCI relies on a return to chloride homeostasis. Sprague Dawley rats received a spinal cord transection at T12 and were assigned to SCI-7d, SCI-14d, SCI-14d+exercise, SCI-28d, SCI-28d+exercise, or SCI-56d groups. During a terminal experiment, H-reflexes were recorded from interosseus muscles after stimulation of the tibial nerve and the low-frequency-dependent depression (FDD) was assessed. We provide evidence that exercise returns spinal excitability and levels of KCC2 and NKCC1 toward normal levels in the lumbar spinal cord. Acutely altering chloride extrusion using the KCC2 blocker DIOA masked the effect of exercise on FDD, whereas blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide returned FDD toward intact levels after SCI. Our results indicate that exercise contributes to reflex recovery and restoration of endogenous inhibition through a return to chloride homeostasis after SCI. This lends support for CCCs as part of a pathway that could be manipulated to improve functional recovery when combined with rehabilitation programs.","bumetanide","pubmed"

Identification of specific molecular pathways that are involved in pain syndromes has become a major priority in current SCI research. We have investigated the role of a cation-dependent chloride transporter, Cl-regulatory protein Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) 1 (NKCC1), phosphorylation profile of NKCC1 and its specific involvement in neuropathic pain following contusion SCI (cSCI) using a rat model. Administration of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (BU) increases the mean hindpaw withdrawal latency time (WLT), thermal hyperalgesia (TH) following cSCI. These results demonstrate implication of NKCC1 co-transporter and BUin SCI-induced neuropathic pain. The with-no-lysine (K)-1 (WNK1) kinase has been shown to be an important regulator of NKCC1 phosphorylation in many systems, including nocioception. Mutations in a neuronal-specific exon of WNK1 (HSN2) was identified in patients that have hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSANII) also implicates WNK1 in nocioception, such that these patients have loss of perception to pain, touch and heat. In our ongoing research we proposed two studies utilizing our contusion SCI (cSCI) NP model of rat. Study 1 aimed at NKCC1 expression and activity is up-regulated following cSCI in the early edema and chronic neuropathic pain phases. Study 2 aimed at identifying the expression profile of alternatively spliced WNK1 isoforms in animals exhibiting thermal hyperalgesia (TH) following cSCI. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (275-300 g) following laminectomy received cSCI at T9 with the NYU impactor-device II by dropping 10 g weight from the height of 12.5 mm. Control rats obtained laminectomy but no impaction. Following injury, functional recovery was assessed by BBB locomotor scores on day 1, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 42 and development of thermal hyperalgesia on day 21, 28, 35, and 42 day of injury by monitoring hind paw withdraw latency time (WLT) in seconds compared with the baseline data before injury. Increased NKCC1 may explain observed increase in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2, exhibiting NKCC1 localization in neurons. This data supports NKCC1's role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic phases of injury, namely spinal cord edema and chronic phase neuropathic pain. NKCC1 dependent chloride influx requires the phosphorylation at specific residues. Probing for the HSN2 exon of WNK1 reveals two key findings: i) the HSN2 exon is found in alternatively spliced neuronal isoforms found at 250 kDa and 230 kDa; ii) the 250 kDa isoform is found only in tissue that is injured. This data implicates the NKCC1/WNK1/WNK1HSN2 involvement in post-injury response that contributes to the development of neuropathic pain. Targeting this system may have therapeutic benefit.","bumetanide","pubmed"

This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 microM were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (< or = 10%) of the preanoxic response.

In this investigation, the effect of buprenorphine was assessed at the molecular, behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological levels after SCI. Rats were injured at the T10 thoracic level using the NYU impactor device. Half of the animals received buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days immediately after SCI, and the other half were untreated. Microarray analysis (n = 5) was performed and analyzed using the Array Assist software. The genes under study were grouped in four categories according to function: regeneration, apoptosis, second messengers, and nociceptive related genes. Microarray analysis demonstrated no significant difference in gene expression between rats treated with buprenorphine and the control group at 2 and 4 days post-injury (DPI). Experiments performed to determine the effect of buprenorphine at the electrophysiological (tcMMEP), behavioral (BBB, grid walking and beam crossing), and histological (luxol staining) levels revealed no significant difference at 7 and 14 DPI in the return of nerve conduction, functional recovery, or white matter sparing between control and experimental groups (p > 0.05, n = 6).

After injury, single pellet reaching performance and forelimb muscle activity decreased in all rats. From 1 to 6 weeks after injury, rats were tested on these tasks with and without buspirone (1-2 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (1-5 mg/kg). Reaching and grasping success rates of buspirone-treated rats improved rapidly within 2 weeks after injury and plateaued over the next 4 weeks of testing. Electromyography (EMG) from selected muscles in the dominant forelimb showed that buspirone-treated animals used new reaching strategies to achieve success after the injury. However, forelimb performance dramatically decreased within 2 weeks of buspirone withdrawal. In contrast, fluoxetine treatment resulted in a more progressive rate of improvement in forelimb performance over 8 weeks after injury. Neither buspirone nor fluoxetine significantly improved quadrupedal locomotion on the horizontal ladder test. The improved accuracy of reaching and grasping, patterns of muscle activity, and increased excitability of spinal motor-evoked potentials after buspirone administration reflect extensive reorganization of connectivity within and between supraspinal and spinal sensory-motor netxcopy works. Thus, both serotonergic drugs, buspirone and fluoxetine, neuromodulated these networks to physiological states that enabled markedly improved forelimb function after cervical spinal cord injury.","buspirone","pubmed"

Human trials must be performed to determine whether individuals with SCI respond similarly. We hypothesized that Buspirone and Trazodone would decrease the propensity to hypocapnic CSA during sleep. We studied eight males with chronic SCI and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [age: 48.8 ± 14.2 yr; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 44.9 ± 23.1] in a single-blind crossover design. For 13 days, participants were randomly assigned either Buspirone (7.5-15 mg twice daily), Trazodone (100 mg), or a placebo followed by a 14-day washout period before crossing over to the other interventions. Study nights included polysomnography and induction of CSA using a noninvasive ventilation protocol. We assessed indexes of SDB, CO2 reserve, apneic threshold (AT), controller gain (CG), plant gain (PG), and ventilatory parameters. CO2 reserve was significantly widened on Buspirone (-3.6 ± 0.9 mmHg) compared with both Trazodone (-2.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.009) and placebo (-1.8 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.001) but not on Trazodone vs. placebo (P = 0.061).

The objective of the present study was, first, to verify buspirone effect on locomotor spinal network and to evaluate if it promoted functional recovery when combined with training. Also, we evaluated buspirone impact on locomotion in mice that had recovered from a previous hemisection before sustaining the spinal transection. This dual lesion paradigm has allowed confirmation of spinal network involvement in recovery after an incomplete SCL. Buspirone acutely increased the number of steps taken, the coupling strength between hindlimbs, angular excursion of the hip joint during locomotion, and improved paw positioning at contact and paw drag (ps < 0.05). Moreover, it induced long-lasting improvements of paw positioning at contact and paw drag when combined with training in mice after a dual lesion paradigm. Altogether, the results indicate that buspirone exerts considerable acute facilitation of spinally mediated locomotion, and could be used in combination with training to promote functional recovery after SCL.","buspirone","pubmed"

The vagus nerve contains mechano- and chemosensory fibers as well as the motor fibers necessary for the central nervous system (CNS) control of GI reflexes. Cell bodies for the vagal afferent fibers are located within the nodose gangla (NG) and the majority of vagal afferent axons are unmyelinated C fibers that are sensitive to capsaicin through activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels. Vagal afferent fibers also express receptors for GI hormones, including cholecystokinin (CCK). Previously, T3-SCI provokes a transient GI inflammatory response as well as a reduction of both gastric emptying and centrally-mediated vagal responses to GI peptides, including CCK. TRPV1 channels and CCK-A receptors (CCKar) expressed in vagal afferents are upregulated in models of visceral inflammation.

Vagal afferent response to graded mechanical stimulation of the stomach was significantly attenuated by T3-SCI at 3-day and 3-week recovery. Immunocytochemical labeling for CCKar and TRPV1 demonstrated expression on dissociated gastric-projecting NG neurons. Quantitative assessment of mRNA expression by qRT-PCR revealed significant elevation of CCKar and TRPV1 in the whole NG following T3-SCI in 3-day recovery, but levels returned to normal after 3-weeks. Three days after injury, systemic administration of CCK-8 s showed a significantly diminished gastric vagal afferent response in T3-SCI rats compared to control rats while systemic capsaicin infusion revealed a significant elevation of vagal response in T3-SCI vs control rats. These findings demonstrate that T3-SCI provokes peripheral remodeling and prolonged alterations in the response of vagal afferent fibers to the physiological signals associated with digestion.","capsaicin","pubmed"

Nociceptive sensory input is capable of altering motor output at the spinal level, and nociceptive neurons are sensitized after SCI. Here we tested the hypotheses that stretch-induced locomotor deficits are dependent on nociceptive afferents by depleting TRPV1+ sensory afferents using capsaicin injections in neonatal rats. Following maturation, animals received 25g-cm contusive SCI at T10. After plateau of locomotor recovery at 6 weeks, daily stretching was performed for 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without stretch, and again for two additional weeks. Animals were sacrificed 2 h after the last stretching session for histological assessments. Consistent with previous findings, stretch-induced drops in locomotor function were observed in nociceptor-intact animals but were nearly absent in nociceptor-depleted animals. These functional changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in the number of c-Fos+ nuclei throughout the lumbar enlargement. As expected, nociceptor-depleted animals had very little CGRP+ axonal innervation of the dorsal horn. Nociceptor-intact stretched animals had significantly higher levels of CGRP+ as compared to non-stretched SCI rats, suggesting that stretching promoted intraspinal CGRP+ sprouting. These results indicate that stretch-induced locomotor dysfunction in animals with incomplete SCI involves C-fibers, adding a negative post-SCI role to their adaptive roles (e.g., bladder control), and suggesting that the clinical use of muscle stretching to combat contractures and spasticity may be unintentionally detrimental to locomotor function.","capsaicin","pubmed"

Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury.","capsaicin","pubmed"

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death.","capsaicin","pubmed"

Following chronic cervical spinal cord injury, bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation-induced inhibition of phrenic activity was exaggerated. Supersensitivity of phrenic motor outputs to the inhibitory effect of bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation is due to a shift of phrenic motoneuron types and slow recovery of phrenic motoneuron discharge in cervical spinal cord-injured animals. These data suggest that activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibres may retard phrenic output recovery following cervical spinal cord injury. The alteration of phenotype and discharge pattern of phrenic motoneuron enables us to understand the impact of spinal cord injury on spinal respiratory activity. Cervical spinal injury interrupts bulbospinal pathways and results in cessation of phrenic bursting ipsilateral to the lesion. The ipsilateral phrenic activity can partially recover over weeks to months following injury due to the activation of latent crossed spinal pathways and exhibits a greater capacity to increase activity during respiratory challenges than the contralateral phrenic nerve. However, whether the bilateral phrenic nerves demonstrate differential responses to respiratory inhibitory inputs is unclear. Accordingly, the present study examined bilateral phrenic bursting in response to capsaicin-induced pulmonary chemoreflexes, a robust respiratory inhibitory stimulus. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated adult rats at 8-9 weeks after C2 hemisection (C2Hx) or C2 laminectomy. Intra-jugular capsaicin (1.5 μg kg-1 ) injection was performed to activate the bronchopulmonary C-fibres to evoke pulmonary chemoreflexes. The present results indicate that capsaicin-induced prolongation of expiratory duration was significantly attenuated in C2Hx animals. However, ipsilateral phrenic activity was robustly reduced after capsaicin treatment compared to uninjured animals. Single phrenic fibre recording experiments demonstrated that C2Hx animals had a higher proportion of late-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons that were relatively sensitive to capsaicin treatment compared to early-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons. Moreover, late-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons in C2Hx animals had a weaker discharge frequency and slower recovery time than uninjured animals. These results suggest bilateral phrenic nerves differentially respond to bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation following unilateral cervical hemisection, and the severe inhibition of phrenic bursting is due to a shift in the discharge pattern of phrenic motoneurons.","capsaicin","pubmed"

The present study examined whether the pulmonary chemoreflex can recover during the chronic injury phase and investigated the role of bronchopulmonary C-fibers on the altered breathing pattern after C2Hx. In the first protocol, bronchopulmonary C-fibers were excited by intrajugular capsaicin administration in uninjured and complete C2Hx animals 8 wk postsurgery. Capsaicin evoked pulmonary chemoreflexes in both groups, but the reflex intensity was significantly weaker in C2Hx animals. To examine whether spared spinal white matter tissue contributes to pulmonary chemoreflex recovery, the reflex was evaluated in animals with different extents of lateral injury. Linear regression analyses revealed that tidal volume significantly correlated with the extent of spared tissue; however, capsaicin-induced apnea was not related to injury severity when the ipsilateral-to-contralateral white matter ratio was <50%. In the second protocol, the influence of background bronchopulmonary C-fiber activity on respiration was investigated by blocking C-fiber conduction via perivagal capsaicin treatment. The rapid shallow breathing of C2Hx animals persisted after perivagal capsaicin treatment despite attenuation of pulmonary chemoreflexes. These results indicate that the pulmonary chemoreflex can recover to some extent following spinal injury, but remains attenuated even when there is moderate spinal tissue sparing, and that altered breathing pattern of C2Hx animals cannot be attributed to endogenous activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibers.","capsaicin","pubmed"

Our work shows that these relations can have a lasting effect on spinal plasticity, inducing a form of learning that alters the effect of subsequent nociceptive stimuli. The capacity of lower spinal systems to adapt, in the absence of brain input, is examined in spinally transected rats that receive a nociceptive shock to the tibialis anterior muscle of one hind leg. If shock is delivered whenever the leg is extended (controllable stimulation), it induces an increase in flexion duration that minimizes net shock exposure. This learning is not observed in subjects that receive the same amount of shock independent of leg position (uncontrollable stimulation). These two forms of stimulation have a lasting, and divergent, effect on subsequent learning: controllable stimulation enables learning whereas uncontrollable stimulation disables it (learning deficit). Uncontrollable stimulation also enhances mechanical reactivity. We review evidence that training with controllable stimulation engages a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent process that can both prevent and reverse the consequences of uncontrollable shock. We relate these effects to changes in BDNF protein and TrkB signaling. Controllable stimulation is also shown to counter the effects of peripheral inflammation (from intradermal capsaicin). A model is proposed that assumes nociceptive input is gated at an early sensory stage. This gate is sensitive to current environmental relations (between proprioceptive and nociceptive input), allowing stimulation to be classified as controllable or uncontrollable. We further propose that the status of this gate is affected by past experience and that a history of uncontrollable stimulation will promote the development of neuropathic pain.","capsaicin","pubmed"

This reflex pathway, which is activated by small myelinated (Adelta) bladder afferent nerves, is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Spinal cord injury at cervical or thoracic levels disrupts voluntary voiding, as well as the normal reflex pathways that coordinate bladder and sphincter function. Following spinal cord injury, the bladder is initially areflexic but then becomes hyperreflexic due to the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. The recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury is dependent in part on the plasticity of bladder afferent pathways and the unmasking of reflexes triggered by unmyelinated, capsaicin-sensitive, C-fiber bladder afferent neurons. Plasticity is associated with morphologic, chemical, and electrical changes in bladder afferent neurons and appears to be mediated in part by neurotrophic factors released in the spinal cord and the peripheral target organs.

This neural system coordinates the activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract: (1) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (2) an outlet (consisting of bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the pelvic floor). During urine storage the outlet is closed and the bladder is quiescent, thereby maintaining a low intravesical pressure over a wide range of bladder volumes. During micturition the outlet relaxes and the bladder contracts to promote the release of urine. This reciprocal relationship between bladder and outlet is generated by visceral reflex circuits, some of which are under voluntary control. Experimental studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination center (the pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brainstem.

This report describes changes in micturition reflexes 2 h to 14 weeks following spinal cord transection at the lower thoracic level. In acute spinal cats micturition reflexes were blocked, however, several weeks after transection, a long latency (180-200 ms) spinal reflex could be activated by C-fiber bladder afferents. This reflex was blocked by capsaicin in doses (20-30 mg/kg, s.c.) that did not affect micturition reflexes in intact cats. Micturition reflexes were unmasked in acute spinal and facilitated in chronic spinal cats by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Spinal neurons and axons containing opioid peptides were more prominent below the level of transection in chronic spinal cats. VIP, a putative neurotransmitter in C-fiber bladder afferents, inhibited micturition reflexes when injected intrathecally (2-10 micrograms) in intact cats but facilitated micturition reflexes in spinal cats (doses 0.1-1 micrograms, i.t.). VIP-containing C-fiber afferent projections to lamina I of the sacral spinal cord expanded in spinal cats. Thus VIP afferents may have an important role in the recovery of bladder reflexes after spinal injury. Paraplegic animals also exhibit bladder-sphincter dyssynergia, which causes functional outlet obstruction. Studies in rats have revealed that outlet obstruction induced by partial urethral ligation facilitates spinal micturition reflex pathways and causes an expansion of HRP-labelled bladder afferent projections in the spinal cord. These findings raise the possibility that the alterations in central reflex connections in paraplegic animals may be induced in part by changes in peripheral afferent input secondary to outlet obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","capsaicin","pubmed"

The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes.","carbamazepine","pubmed"

An acute SCI rat model was established and neurological function was tested. After carvedilol (10 mg/kg, oral gavage) treatment for 21 days, the status of osteoporosis, neuron damage, astrocyte activation, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated in rats. Carvedilol significantly improved locomotor activity that was decreased by SCI. In addition, carvedilol promoted bone growth by regulating the expression of nuclear factor-κB ligand (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand; RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), inactivating osteoclasts and thereby increasing bone mineral density in tibias. In addition, carvedilol reduced SCI-induced neural damage, increased neuron number and reduced astrocyte activation in the spinal cord. Furthermore, the production and mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 were significantly reduced, reduced glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity were markedly increased and malondialdehyde content was markedly decreased in the spinal cords of carvedilol-treated rats.

This has been reported to be lost after spinal cord transection (txSCI), contributing to impaired function. However, anesthesia may confound evaluating EUS activity. We therefore evaluated urodynamic parameters in unanesthetized, restrained rats and compared the effects of txSCI to that of a clinically relevant, incomplete, contusive injury (iSCI) on lower urinary tract function. Adult female rats were subjected to txSCI or standardized iSCI at the T8 vertebral level. As expected, all injured rats were initially unable to void but developed a reflex bladder with time, with iSCI rats recovering more rapidly than txSCI rats. LUT function was evaluated urodynamically at 2 and 6 weeks after injury. In response to infusion of saline into the bladder, controls consistently exhibited coordinated contraction of the bladder and activation of the EUS in a phasic pattern and had a high voiding efficiency (86.4+/-2.5%). Voiding efficiency of iSCI rats was reduced to approximately 57% and txSCI rats to approximately 32%. However, two different patterns of EUS activity during voiding were present in both txSCI and iSCI groups at both time points: (1) rats with phasic EUS activity, similar to controls and (2) those that only exhibited tonic EUS activity during voiding. The former had more normal voiding efficiencies. Thus, phasic EUS activity and the improved voiding efficiency associated with it can occur and can be detected in unanesthetized rats after both incomplete and complete SCI.","chloral_hydrate","pubmed"

The present study was designed to assess the effect of ACR on neurological recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-230 g were anaesthetised with chloral hydrate and laminectomy was performed at T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) loaded with a weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed cord for 5 minutes. Animals were divided into seven groups of eight rats each. The animals in Group 1 served as control whereas rats in Group 2 underwent laminectomy alone (sham). The rats in Group 3 to 6 were subjected to SCI as mentioned above. Animals in Groups 4, 5 and 6 also received ACR in the doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, i.p., respectively in addition to SCI, whereas the rats in Group 7 received ACR alone at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. The first dose of ACR was given 30 minutes before SCI, followed by daily administration of drug for 7 days. Post traumatic neurological recovery was recorded daily for 10 days using a modified Tarlov score, inclined plane test and sensory and vocal score. Electrophysiological changes were assessed using somatosensory and corticomotor evoked potentials. The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals and the injured site of the spinal cord was analysed for lipid hydroperoxides (LPH), conjugated dienes (CD) and glutathione (GSH). Neuropathological changes in the spinal cord were assessed using light microscopy. The rats exposed to compression injury alone showed a maximum neurological deficit at 24 hr and then a gradual recovery was observed over a period of 10 days. The rats treated with ACR along with SCI showed poor or no recovery over a period of 10 days. Our electrophysiological and histopathological studies also confirmed that concomitant exposure to ACR produces a significant deleterious effect on the recovery from SCI. SCI induced increase in oxidative stress (increase in LPH and CD and decrease in GSH) is also exacerbated by ACR suggesting a role of free radicals. The results of this study suggest that increased body burden of ACR may retard the recovery from neurotrauma or even lead to permanent disability.","chloral_hydrate","pubmed"

In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/α1 receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and α1 receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.","chlorpromazine","pubmed"

Loss of descending serotonergic (5HT) input to spinal circuits is thought to contribute to motor impairments, with enhanced motor function demonstrated through augmentation of 5HT signaling. However, the presence of spastic motor behaviors in SCI is attributed, in part, to changes in spinal 5HT receptors that augment their activity in the absence of 5HT, although data demonstrating motor effects of 5HT agents that deactivate these receptors are conflicting. The effects of enhancement or depression of 5HT signaling on locomotor function have not been thoroughly evaluated in human iSCI. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate acute effects of 5HT medications on locomotion in 10 subjects with chronic (>1 year) iSCI. Peak overground and treadmill locomotor performance, including measures of gait kinematics, electromyographic (EMG) activity, and oxygen consumption, were assessed before and after single-dose administration of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a 5HT antagonist using a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over design. Results indicate that neither medication led to improvements in locomotion, with a significant decrease in peak overground gait speed observed after 5HT antagonists (from 0.8±0.1 to 0.7±0.1 m/s; p=0.01). Additionally, 5-HT medications had differential effects on EMG activity, with 5HT antagonists decreasing extensor activity and SSRIs increasing flexor activity. Our data therefore suggest that acute manipulation of 5HT signaling, despite changes in muscle activity, does not improve locomotor performance after iSCI.","citalopram","pubmed"

Using an adult mouse SCI model, we analyzed the effects of complete spinal cord lesions on the intrinsic electrophysiological properties, excitability, and neuromodulatory responses to serotonin (5-HT) in mouse lumbar V2a spinal INs, which help regulate left-right alternation during locomotion. Four weeks after SCI, V2a INs showed almost no changes in baseline excitability or action potential properties; the only parameter that changed was a reduced input resistance. However, V2a INs became 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive to 5-HT. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that SCI caused a coordinated loss of serotonergic fibers and the 5-HT transporter (SERT). Blocking the SERT with citalopram in intact mice did not increase 5-HT sensitivity to the level seen after SCI. SCI also evoked an increase in 5-HT(2C) receptor cluster number and intensity, suggesting that several plastic changes cooperate in increasing 5-HT sensitivity.

Following medical stabilization, recovery from SCI typically involves long term rehabilitation. While recovery of walking ability is a primary goal in many patients early after injury, those with a motor incomplete SCI, indicating partial preservation of volitional control, may have the sufficient residual descending pathways necessary to attain this goal. However, despite physical interventions, motor impairments including weakness, and the manifestation of abnormal involuntary reflex activity, called spasticity or spasms, are thought to contribute to reduced walking recovery. Doctrinaire thought suggests that remediation of this abnormal motor reflexes associated with SCI will produce functional benefits to the patient. For example, physicians and therapists will provide specific pharmacological or physical interventions directed towards reducing spasticity or spasms, although there continues to be little empirical data suggesting that these strategies improve walking ability. In the past few decades, accumulating data has suggested that specific neuromodulatory agents, including agents which mimic or facilitate the actions of the monoamines, including serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE), can initiate or augment walking behaviors in animal models of SCI. Interestingly, many of these agents, particularly 5HTergic agonists, can markedly increase spinal excitability, which in turn also increases reflex activity in these animals. Counterintuitive to traditional theories of recovery following human SCI, the empirical evidence from basic science experiments suggest that this reflex hyper excitability and generation of locomotor behaviors are driven in parallel by neuromodulatory inputs (5HT) and may be necessary for functional recovery following SCI. The application of this novel concept derived from basic scientific studies to promote recovery following human SCI would appear to be seamless, although the direct translation of the findings can be extremely challenging. Specifically, in the animal models, an implanted catheter facilitates delivery of very specific 5HT agonist compounds directly onto the spinal circuitry. The translation of this technique to humans is hindered by the lack of specific surgical techniques or available pharmacological agents directed towards 5HT receptor subtypes that are safe and effective for human clinical trials. However, oral administration of commonly available 5HTergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be a viable option to increase central 5HT concentrations in order to facilitate walking recovery in humans. Systematic quantification of how these SSRIs modulate human motor behaviors following SCI, with a specific focus on strength, reflexes, and the recovery of walking ability, are missing. This video demonstration is a progressive attempt to systematically and quantitatively assess the modulation of reflex activity, volitional strength and ambulation following the acute oral administration of an SSRI in human SCI. Agents are applied on single days to assess the immediate effects on motor function in this patient population, with long-term studies involving repeated drug administration combined with intensive physical interventions.","citalopram","pubmed"

This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery.

However, our knowledge about spinal plasticity is rather limited. Our recent studies point to changes within the spinal cord below the lesion. After a lateral left hemisection (T10), cats recovered stepping with both hindlimbs within 3 weeks. After a complete section (T13) in these cats, bilateral stepping was seen on the next day, a skill usually acquired after several weeks of treadmill training. This indicates that durable plastic changes occurred below the lesion. However, because sensory feedback entrains the stepping rhythm, it is difficult to reveal central pattern generator (CPG) adaptation. Here, we investigated whether lumbar segments of cats with a chronic hemisection were able to generate fictive locomotion-that is, without phasic sensory feedback as monitored by five muscle nerves in each hindlimb. With a chronic left hemisection, the number of muscle nerves displaying locomotor bursts was larger on the left than on the right. In addition, transmission of cutaneous reflexes was relatively facilitated on the left. Later during the acute experiment, a complete spinalization (T13) was performed and clonidine was injected to induce rhythmic activities. There were still more muscle nerves displaying locomotor bursts on the left. The results demonstrate that spinal networks were indeed modified after a hemisection with a clear asymmetry between left and right in the capacity to generate locomotion. Plastic changes in CPG and reflex transmission below the lesion are thus involved in the stepping recovery after an incomplete SCI.","clonidine","pubmed"

We investigated whether a pharmacological intervention using Tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication acting as an α2-adrenergic agonist, could lead to improvements in walking endurance. We placed subjects on a 4-week program and measured the change in clinical measures of walking speed, endurance, and mobility. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to class subjects into groups based on recovery patterns. Two classes of recovery were found by GMM: high and low functioning. Radom coefficient regression (RCR) was then used to identify significant changes over time. Statistically significant improvements in walking endurance were shown for the high functioning group. However, a small number of subjects in the high functioning group showed improvement greater than the smallest real difference (SRD), which indicates a clinical significance as well. We also investigated the extent to which these recovery patterns can be predicted using baseline measures. Baseline walking endurance was found to be a robust predictor of recovery in walking endurance. Subjects that began the intervention with already higher endurance showed a greater chance of improvement in endurance over time.

The outcome measures were walking speed, endurance and mobility. Subjects were randomized into one of three groups; no intervention (control), Lokomat (Lok) and tizanidine (Tiz). To account for variability, we used growth mixture modelling (GMM) to class subjects based on their recovery patterns. GMM identified two classes of recovery: high and low function. Significant improvements were seen in walking speed and mobility in high and low functioning subjects in the Lok group, and in walking endurance in high functioning subjects in the Tiz group. However, changes with training were clinically important only for approximately 10% of subjects, who achieved a minimal important difference (MID) in functional outcomes as a result of the training. We used mixed model ANOVAs to compare the group effects. Improvements with training were seen in both classes, however no differences between interventions were found. The GMM had classed all subjects that achieved the MID as high functioning. GMM can be used to successfully class subjects; however larger subject numbers and longer interventions are required to fully utilize this technique. Our results demonstrate that both interventions have potential to improve walking capacity, but more intense training for a longer period may need to achieve MID.","clonidine","pubmed"

Our results demonstrate that the endogenous cholinergic propriospinal system, acting via M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors, is capable of consistently producing well-coordinated locomotor activity in the in vitro neonatal preparation, placing it in a position to contribute to normal locomotion and to provide a basis for recovery of locomotor capability in the absence of descending pathways. Tests of these suggestions, however, reveal that the spinal cholinergic system plays little if any role in the induction of locomotion, because MLR-evoked locomotion in decerebrate cats is not prevented by cholinergic antagonists. Furthermore, it is not required for the development of stepping movements after spinal cord injury, because cholinergic agonists do not facilitate the appearance of locomotion after spinal cord injury, unlike the dramatic locomotion-promoting effects of clonidine, a noradrenergic α-2 agonist. Furthermore, cholinergic antagonists actually improve locomotor activity after spinal cord injury, suggesting that plastic changes in the spinal cholinergic system interfere with locomotion rather than facilitating it. Changes that have been observed in the cholinergic innervation of motoneurons after spinal cord injury do not decrease motoneuron excitability, as expected. Instead, the development of a ""hyper-cholinergic"" state after spinal cord injury appears to enhance motoneuron output and suppress locomotion. A cholinergic suppression of afferent input from the limb after spinal cord injury is also evident from our data, and this may contribute to the ability of cholinergic antagonists to improve locomotion. Not only is a role for the spinal cholinergic system in suppressing locomotion after SCI suggested by our results, but an obligatory contribution of a brainstem cholinergic relay to reticulospinal locomotor command systems is not confirmed by our experiments.","clonidine","pubmed"

Participants with an incomplete SCI were assigned to 3 groups: no intervention, Lokomat, or tizanidine. Outcome measures were the 10-m walk test, 6-minute walk test, and the Timed Up and Go. Participants were classified in 2 ways: (1) based on achieving an improvement above the minimally important difference (MID) and (2) using growth mixture modeling (GMM). Functional levels of participants who achieved the MID were compared and random coefficient regression (RCR) was used to assess recovery in GMM classes. Overall, walking speed and endurance improved, with no difference between interventions. Only a small number of participants achieved the MID. Both MID and GMM-RCR analyses revealed that tizanidine improved endurance in high-functioning participants. GMM-RCR classification also showed that speed and mobility improved after locomotor training. Improvements in function were achieved in a limited number of people with SCI. Using the MID and GMM techniques, differences in responses to interventions between high-and low-functioning participants could be identified. These techniques may, therefore, have potential to be used for characterizing therapeutic effects resulting from different interventions.","clonidine","pubmed"

Since these measures are neither objective nor quantitative, the therapeutic effects of such medications on neuromuscular properties have not been fully evaluated. In this study, as a first attempt, we examined the effect of tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication, on modification of the neuromuscular properties of patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Each patient was administered 2 mg of tizanidine four times per day for four weeks. The spastic ankle of each patient was evaluated at baseline (prior to any medication, and then 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the start of medication. The ankle was perturbed with a small-amplitude Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) perturbation at various positions over the ankle range-of-motion. A parallel-cascade system identification technique, which provides an objective and quantitative measure of neuromuscular properties, was used to calculate the intrinsic and reflex stiffness. The stiffness vs. joint angle trends were then calculated for each evaluation; these curves were compared across the intervention time to determine the recovery pattern (i.e. change over time) due to the tizanidine intervention. All patients exhibited decreases in reflex stiffness (which abnormally increase after SCI) due to the medication; however, patients were observed to exhibit multiple recovery patterns. For some patients, the reflex stiffness continuously reduced over the four-week intervention period, while for other patients, the decrease during the first week (i.e. between the baseline and 1-Week evaluations) was most pronounced. Also, some patients presented a significant decrease with time, while others presented no improvement in the intrinsic stiffness. These findings suggest that tizanidine may be effective in reducing not only reflex stiffness, but also the subject's intrinsic stiffness for certain patients. Future work remains to identify predictors which can objectively determine which patients are likely to exhibit maximal benefit from the tizanidine prior to being prescribed with the medication.","clonidine","pubmed"

However, the mechanisms involved in clonidine-induced functional recovery are poorly understood. Sensory feedback from the legs is critical for hindlimb locomotor recovery in spinalized mammals and clonidine could alter how spinal neurons respond to peripheral inputs in adult spinalized cats. To test this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of clonidine on the responses of hindlimb muscles, primarily in the left hindlimb, evoked by stretching the left triceps surae muscles and by stimulating the right tibial and superficial peroneal nerves in eight adult decerebrate cats that were spinalized 1 month before the terminal experiment. Cats were not trained following spinalization. Clonidine had no consistent effect on responses of ipsilateral muscles evoked by triceps surae muscle stretch. However, clonidine consistently potentiated the amplitude and duration of crossed extensor responses. Moreover, following clonidine injection, stretch and tibial nerve stimulation triggered episodes of locomotor-like activity in approximately one-third of trials. Differential effects of clonidine on crossed reflexes and on ipsilateral responses to muscle stretch indicate an action at a pre-motoneuronal site. We conclude that clonidine facilitates hindlimb locomotor recovery following spinalization in untrained cats by enhancing the excitability of central pattern generating spinal neurons that also participate in crossed extensor reflex transmission.","clonidine","pubmed"

One RCT provided Level 1 evidence that GM-1 ganglioside in combination with physical therapy improved motor scores, walking velocity, and distance better than placebo and physical therapy in persons with incomplete SCI. Multiple studies (levels of evidence 1-5) showed that clonidine and cyproheptadine may improve locomotor function and walking speed in severely impaired individuals with incomplete SCI. Gains in walking speed associated with GM-1, cyproheptadine, and clonidine are low compared to those seen with locomotor training.

Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-Séquard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries.","clonidine","pubmed"

For example, proprioceptive feedback from limb loading during the stance phase is crucial for the recovery of stepping in spinal-injured animals and humans. Our recent results showed that step training modified transmission from group I afferents of extensors in spinal cats. However, cutaneous afferents are also activated during locomotion and are necessary for proper foot placement in spinal cats. We therefore hypothesized that step training would also modify transmission in cutaneous pathways to facilitate recovery of stepping. We tested transmission in cutaneous pathways by comparing intracellular responses in lumbar motoneurons (n = 136) in trained (n = 11) and untrained (n = 7) cats spinalized 3-5 weeks before the acute electrophysiological experiment. Three cutaneous nerves were stimulated, and each evoked up to three motoneuronal responses mediated by at least three different pathways. Overall, of 71 cutaneous pathways tested, 10 were modified by step training: transmission was reduced in 7 and facilitated in 3. Remarkably, 6 of 10 involved the medial plantar nerve innervating the plantar surface of the foot, including two of the facilitated pathways. Because the cutaneous reflexes are exaggerated after spinalization, we interpret the decrease in most pathways as a normalization of cutaneous transmission necessary to recover locomotor movements. Overall, the results showed a high degree of specificity in plasticity among cutaneous pathways and indicate that transmission of skin inputs signaling ground contact, in particular, is modified by step training.","clonidine","pubmed"

The EMG activity of the lower limb muscles, initially characterized by tonic discharge and abnormal timing, became more phasic with less clonus following medication, which was related to a change in the kinematic pattern. Further kinematic and functional improvement were gained by training. Previously wheelchair-bound, both patients became functionally ambulatory overground with the aid of Canadian crutches. Thus, a potentially effective strategy for facilitating the expression of the locomotor pattern following spinal cord injury is proposed.

But what are the prospects for quadriplegics? Certain fundamental issues make treatment approaches to quadriplegia different and difficult. Injury at cervical region poses additional problems for any surgical intervention with life-threatening risks of i) endangering respiratory function, ii) cavitation, cysts, and syringomyelia formation extending cephalad to the injury, and iii) mid-lower cervical injuries, lower motor neuron death, and the resultant degeneration of brachial plexus axons would still leave the upper limbs denervated and paralyzed even as treatment procedures might successfully salvage the lower limbs. With these apparently insurmountable impediments in quadriplegic cord repair, it would be wise to turn to alternative treatment strategies. Conventional treatment models since the days of Ralph Gerard (1940) have all used intra-vertebral procedures. We present here a plausible extra-vertebral repair model suitable for incomplete cord injuries at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels.

Three days after intracerebral hemorrhage, brain edema, hematoma volume and the number of apoptotic cells were quantified. In another cohort of mice, brain atrophy was evaluated two weeks following intracerebral hemorrhage. Neurobehavioral tests were performed on the 3rd, the 7th and the 14th day. Fingolimod significantly decreased edema, apoptosis and brain atrophy. More importantly, fingolimod enhanced neurobehavioral recovery. Preliminary experiments showed no difference in the number of inflammatory (CD68-positive) cells between the two groups.

The objective of this retrospective case-control study was to identify risk factors for PMM by comparing dogs with complete sensorimotor loss following IVDE that did and did not develop the disease after surgery. We also investigated whether any risk factors for PMM influenced return of ambulation. Medical records of client-owned dogs with paraplegia and loss of pain perception that underwent surgery for IVDE from 1998 to 2016, were reviewed. Dogs were categorized as PMM yes or no based on clinical progression or histopathology. Walking outcome at 6 months was established. Signalment, onset and duration of signs (categorized), steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (yes or no), site of IVDE (lumbar intumescence or thoracolumbar) and longitudinal extent of IVDE were retrieved and their associations with PMM and walking outcome were examined using logistic regression. One hundred and ninety seven dogs were included, 45 with and 152 without PMM. A 6-month-outcome was available in 178 dogs (all 45 PMM dogs and 133 control dogs); 86 recovered walking (all in the control group). Disc extrusions at the lumbar intumescence were associated with PMM (p = 0.01, OR: 3.02, CI: 1.3-7.2). Surgery performed more than 12 h after loss of ambulation was associated with PMM (OR = 3.4; CI = 1.1-10.5, p = 0.03 for 12-24 h and OR = 4.6; CI = 1.3-16.6, p = 0.02 for the > 24 h categories when compared with the ≤12 h category).

The goals of treatment in spinal metastases are pain control and improvement of neurological function in order to achieve better quality of life (QoL). The standard of care in most cases is rapid initiation of corticosteroids in combination with either surgical decompression in case of an operable candidate, followed by radiation therapy (RT) or RT alone. Surgery is associated with improved outcomes, but is not appropriate for many patients presenting with advanced symptoms of MSCC, such as paralysis, or those with a poor performance status, or cachexic state, as well as altered mental conditions, co-morbidities, surgical risks, and limited life expectancy. On the other hand, aggressive surgical treatment and post-operative RT is advocated for those with more favorable prognosis, or who are expected to have higher neurological recovery potential. Many candidates may require for combined anterior and posterior approaches to effectively deal with the compressive pathology and stabilize the spine. Most patients are presently treated by primary RT, given with the aim of improving function and symptom management. However, there is still debate regarding the most appropriate RT schedule.

This study investigated the role of neuronal regeneration and the location of the neuronal regeneration after SCI in rats. This is an experimental animal study of acute spinal cord injury investigating the neuronal regeneration after SCI. Double immunofluorescence staining of NF-200 and BrdU was performed to detect the location of the neuronal regeneration. Forty-five adult Wistar rats were tested. Allen hit model (10 g) induced acute SCI sites targeted at the T10 segments. Nestin expression was detected via immunohistochemistry. Double immunofluorescence staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was performed 10 mm away from the spinal cord center. Neural functional recovery was determined using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score and electro-physiological examination. The study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 81272172). The funder of this study had no capacity to influence the scholarly conduct of the research, interpretation of results, or dissemination of study outcomes. BrdU- and NF-200-positive cells were rarely detected and absent at 3 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. We also detected the BrdU and NF-200 co-expressed cells are at 3 to 5 mm away from the injured site, and no co-expressed cells were detected at the injured site in this SCI model. The BBB score and electro-physiological examination of the nervous system were significantly different at 4 weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that neurons are regenerated 3 to 5 mm away from the injured site, and no neurons are regenerated at the injured site in this SCI model, which suggests a novel train of thought on SCI treatment.","corticosteroids","pubmed"

When neurologic injury occurs it is generally of a very low incidence and with a gradual onset, and spontaneous recovery can be expected. Most reports in the literature are of delayed-onset paraplegia after vertebral collapse. We report a unique case of a sudden and catastrophic thoracic spinal cord injury occurring spontaneously. An 88-year-old woman had a sudden thoracic vertebral fracture with complete spinal cord injury while attempting to get out of bed. She was treated with continuous oral corticosteroids for >40 years for both rheumatoid arthritis and restrictive lung disease. She was never investigated or treated for osteoporosis. Plain radiographs indicated multilevel osteoporotic fractures throughout the spine with diffuse, marked osteopenia. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed changes in keeping with severe vertebral osteoporosis and spinal cord injury. She was treated nonoperatively in view of the extremely osteoporotic spine and her overall poor medical condition. Despite an initial improvement in her respiratory condition with medical therapy, she died 72 hours following admission. With increasing awareness of the morbidity attached to the osteoporotic spine, investigation and pharmacologic treatment are warranted and may reduce the possibility of catastrophic neurologic impairment as occurred in this case.","corticosteroids","pubmed"

Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment. This first decade of the new millennium, now touted as the Decade of the Spine, will hopefully witness the emergence of universal and efficacious pharmacologic therapy and ultimately a cure for SCI.","corticosteroids","pubmed"

While medications and physical rehabilitation are prescribed to alleviate spastic symptoms, the insufficiency of their effects remains an important problem to be addressed. Given the challenges associated with increasing the dose of medication, we hypothesized that a combination therapy with medication and physical rehabilitation can be effective. Therefore, we examined the effects of treadmill training (TMT) along with serotonergic medication using a spastic rat model after contusive injury. Spasticity-strong SCI rats were selected 4 weeks after SCI and received one of the following interventions for 2 weeks: only TMT, TMT with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), TMT with cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist), only fluoxetine, or only cyproheptadine. We performed the swimming test to quantify the frequency of spastic behaviors. We also evaluated hindlimb locomotor functions every week. At the end of the intervention, we examined the Hoffman reflex from the plantar muscle and the immunoreactivity of the 5-HT2A receptor in spinal cord tissues. While the TMT group and cyproheptadine-treated groups showed decreased spastic behaviors and reduction in spinal hyperreflexia, the fluoxetine-treated group showed the opposite effect, even with TMT. Moreover, TMT suppressed the expression of the 5-HT2A receptor in the lumbar spinal motor neurons, while cyproheptadine treatment did not change it. We did not observe any differences in locomotor functions between the groups. Taken together, our findings indicate that TMT and cyproheptadine significantly alleviated spastic symptoms, but did not show synergistic or additive effects.","cyproheptadine","pubmed"

Loss of descending serotonergic (5HT) input to spinal circuits is thought to contribute to motor impairments, with enhanced motor function demonstrated through augmentation of 5HT signaling. However, the presence of spastic motor behaviors in SCI is attributed, in part, to changes in spinal 5HT receptors that augment their activity in the absence of 5HT, although data demonstrating motor effects of 5HT agents that deactivate these receptors are conflicting. The effects of enhancement or depression of 5HT signaling on locomotor function have not been thoroughly evaluated in human iSCI. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate acute effects of 5HT medications on locomotion in 10 subjects with chronic (>1 year) iSCI. Peak overground and treadmill locomotor performance, including measures of gait kinematics, electromyographic (EMG) activity, and oxygen consumption, were assessed before and after single-dose administration of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a 5HT antagonist using a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over design. Results indicate that neither medication led to improvements in locomotion, with a significant decrease in peak overground gait speed observed after 5HT antagonists (from 0.8±0.1 to 0.7±0.1 m/s; p=0.01). Additionally, 5-HT medications had differential effects on EMG activity, with 5HT antagonists decreasing extensor activity and SSRIs increasing flexor activity. Our data therefore suggest that acute manipulation of 5HT signaling, despite changes in muscle activity, does not improve locomotor performance after iSCI.","cyproheptadine","pubmed"

In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/α1 receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and α1 receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.","cyproheptadine","pubmed"

Here we examine how over time motoneurons compensate for lost 5-HT to regain excitability. We find that, months after a spinal transection in rats, changes in post-transcriptional editing of 5-HT2C receptor mRNA lead to increased expression of 5-HT2C receptor isoforms that are spontaneously active (constitutively active) without 5-HT. Such constitutive receptor activity restores large persistent calcium currents in motoneurons in the absence of 5-HT. We show that this helps motoneurons recover their ability to produce sustained muscle contractions and ultimately enables recovery of motor functions such as locomotion. However, without regulation from the brain, these sustained contractions can also cause debilitating muscle spasms. Accordingly, blocking constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors with SB206553 or cyproheptadine, in both rats and humans, largely eliminates these calcium currents and muscle spasms, providing a new rationale for antispastic drug therapy.","cyproheptadine","pubmed"

The EMG activity of the lower limb muscles, initially characterized by tonic discharge and abnormal timing, became more phasic with less clonus following medication, which was related to a change in the kinematic pattern. Further kinematic and functional improvement were gained by training. Previously wheelchair-bound, both patients became functionally ambulatory overground with the aid of Canadian crutches.

Riluzole and dantrolene have been shown to provide neuroprotection by reducing neuronal apoptosis after brain and spinal cord injury (SCI) in several animal models of neurologic disorders. As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we investigated the cumulative effects of riluzole and dantrolene. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of the combined administration of riluzole and dantrolene in experimental thoracic SCI. Twenty-nine Wistar rats were laminectomized at T12 and divided in five groups. Rats in GI (n=6) underwent laminectomy alone and were treated with placebo. Rats in GII (n=6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with placebo. Rats in GIII (n=5) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with riluzole and placebo 15 minutes and 1 hour after laminectomy, respectively. Rats in GIV (n=6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with placebo and dantrolene 15 minutes and 1 hour after laminectomy, respectively. Rats in GV (n=6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with riluzole and dantrolene 15 minutes and 1 hour after laminectomy, respectively. A compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. Behavioral testing of hind limb function was performed using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, which revealed significant recovery in the group treated with the association of riluzole and dantrolene compared with other groups. After euthanasia, the spinal cord was evaluated using light microscopy and immunochemistry with anti-NeuN and transferase dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. Animals treated with the association of riluzole and dantrolene showed a larger number of NeuN-positive neurons adjacent to the epicenter of injury (p≤.05). Furthermore, the TUNEL staining was similar between animals treated with riluzole and dantrolene and those that did not receive spinal cord trauma (p>.05). These results showed that riluzole and dantrolene have a synergistic effect in neuroprotection after traumatic SCI by decreasing apoptotic cell death.","dantrolene","pubmed"

We examined the effects of traumatic compressive injury on (Ca2+)i dynamics in spinal cord white matter. We conducted electrophysiological studies with ryanodine and inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) receptor agonists and antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury (SCI). A 25-30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber (37 degrees C) and injured with a modified clip (2-g closing force) for 15 sec. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential (CAP) with glass microelectrodes. The CAP decreased to 55.2+/-6.8% of control (p < 0.05) after spinal cord injury (SCI). Chelation of Ca2+i with BAPTA-AM (a high-affinity calcium chelator) promoted significantly greater recovery of CAP amplitude (83.2+/-4.2% of control; p < 0.05) after injury. Infusion of caffeine (1 and 10 mM) exacerbated CAP amplitude decline (45.1+/-5.9% of control; p < 0.05; 44.6+/-3.1% of control; p < 0.05) postinjury. Blockade of Ca2+i release through ryanodine-sensitive receptors (RyRs) with dantrolene (10 microM) and ryanodine (50 microM), conferred significant (p < 0.05) improvement in CAP amplitude after injury. On the other hand, blockade of Ca2+i with inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate receptor (IP3Rs) blocker 2APB (10 microM) also conferred significant improvement in CAP amplitude after injury (82.9+/-7.9%; p < 0.05). In conclusion, the injurious effects of Ca2+i in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) white matter injury appear to be mediated both by RyRs and through IP3Rs calcium-induced calcium release receptors (CICRs).","dantrolene","pubmed"

The inflammatory response plays a key role in this pathology. Recent evidence suggests that myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme produced and released by neutrophils, is of special importance in spreading tissue damage. Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is an irreversible inhibitor of MPO. Recently, we demonstrated, in a model of brain ischemia/reperfusion, that dapsone has antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. The effects of dapsone on MPO activity, lipid peroxidation (LP) processes, motor function recovery, and the amount of spared tissue were evaluated in a rat model of SCI. MPO activity had increased 24.5-fold 24 hr after SCI vs. the sham group, and it had diminished by 38% and 19% in the groups treated with dapsone at 3 and 5 hr after SCI, respectively. SCI increased LP by 45%, and this increase was blocked by dapsone. In rats treated with dapsone, a significant motor function recovery (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score, BBB) was observed beginning during the first week of evaluation and continuing until the end of the study. Spontaneous recovery 8 weeks after SCI was 9.2 ± 1.12, whereas, in the dapsone-treated groups, it reached 13.6 ± 1.04 and 12.9 ± 1.17. Spared tissue increased by 42% and 33% in the dapsone-treated groups (3 and 5 hr after SCI, respectively) vs. SCI without treatment. Dapsone significantly prevented mortality. The results show that inhibition of MPO by dapsone significantly protected the spinal cord from tissue damage and enhanced motor recovery after SCI.","dapsone","pubmed"

Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive erythropoietin (5000 IU/kg), darbepoetin (10 mug/kg), or saline, as a single intravenous injection 1 h after a thoracic contusion SCI. The animals were evaluated for behavioral recovery over 6 weeks, which included BBB locomotor testing, horizontal ladder testing, video-analysis of gait, and hindlimb monofilament sensory testing. At 6 week post-injury, the spinal cords were evaluated histologically to measure white and grey matter sparing at and around the epicenter of injury. We found that neither erythropoietin nor darbepoetin led to improved behavioral recovery over saline controls, with no significant differences observed in BBB scores, BBB subscores, footfall errors on horizontal ladder testing, width of hindlimb base of support, or threshold for paw withdrawal on sensory testing. Furthermore, no differences were observed in grey or white matter sparing between the three experimental groups. Using doses of erythropoietin and darbepoetin that other investigators have reported to be beneficial in SCI and stroke models, we were unable to demonstrate a neuroprotective effect when administered 1 h after injury.

The patient recovered progressively and was discharged from the hospital ten days after erythropoietin therapy. This case report supports the beneficial role of erythropoietin in function, maintenance, and recovery of neurons. Erythropoietin is a double-edge sword, as long-term erythropoietin therapy has some complications, like thromboembolism and stroke.

Mice lacking NgR are viable but display hypoactivity and motor impairment. DRG neurons lacking NgR do not bind Nogo-66, and their growth cones are not collapsed by Nogo-66. Recovery of motor function after dorsal hemisection or complete transection of the spinal cord is improved in the ngr(-/-) mice.

Similarly, addition of 10 nM FK506 increased the percentage of neurites in the 20- to 40-micron range. A low dose (1 mM) of dexamethasone did not have a significant effect on neurite outgrowth, but a higher dose (10 mM) increased the percentage of neurites in the 10- to 45-micron range. These agents also lessened the degree of thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and dexamethasone can potentiate neurite outgrowth and protect against apoptotic cell death in a human postmitotic neuronal cell line. Such effects may have implications for lessening neuronal injury after neurotrauma, stroke, or neurodegeneration.","dexamethasone","pubmed"

Furthermore, the different functional recovery between treated and non-treated animals was recorded. Although the administration of dexamethasone showed a beneficial effect on the functional recovery of the animals, the tissue expression of VPF after SCI is not influenced by dexamethasone administration. Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of the dexamethasone after experimental SCI is not mediated through an interference on the biological effects of the 165-aa vascular permeability factor.","dexamethasone","pubmed"

While several mechanisms were proposed to account for these effects, limited information exists regarding GC actions in sensory areas of the spinal cord. Presently, we studied the time course of Fos expression, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical staining to monitor neuronal responses to SCI with or without GC treatment. Rats with sham-operation or transection at the thoracic level (T7-T8) received vehicle or 5 mg/kg of the GC dexamethasone (DEX) at 5 min post-lesion and were sacrificed 2 or 4 h after surgery. Another group of SCI rats received vehicle or intensive DEX treatment (5 min, 6 h, 18 h and 46 h post-lesion) and were sacrificed 48 h after surgery. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons or Fos immunoreactive nuclei was studied by computer-assisted image analysis in superficial dorsal horn (Laminae I-III) and central canal area (Lamina X) below the lesion. While constitutive Fos immunoreactive nuclei were sparse in controls, SCI increased Fos expression at 2 and 4 h after injury. DEX treatment significantly enhanced the number of Fos positive nuclei in Laminae I-III by 4 h after transection, although the response was not maintained by intensive steroid treatment when tested at 48 h after SCI. NADPH-d positive neurons in Laminae I-III increased at 2 and 4 h after SCI while a delayed increased was found in central canal area (Lamina X). DEX treatment decreased NADPH-d positive neurons to sham-operated levels at all time points examined. Thus, while GC stimulation of Fos suggests activation of neurons involved in sympathetic outflow and/or pain, down-regulation of NADPH-d indicates attenuation of nociceptive outflow, considering the role of enzyme-derived nitric oxide in pain-related mechanisms. Differential hormonal effects on these molecules agree with their localization in different cell populations.","dexamethasone","pubmed"

SCI induces the expression of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), that in the absence of the high affinity component, TrkA, can promote cell death by apoptosis. We therefore hypothesized that a reduction of p75NTR expression in SCI may increase tissue sparing and therefore improve recovery of function. As a tool to test our hypothesis we used the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) to down-regulate p75NTR expression. A standardized thoracic spinal cord contusion injury was produced in female rats. Laminectomized and SCI rats received various doses of DEX immediately after injury and the treatment was continued daily for 7 days. DEX, given at high doses (20 mg/kg, s.c.) but not at low doses (1 or 8 mg/kg) prevented the increase in p75NTR mRNA and protein in SCI rats, without affecting the expression of TrkA. High doses of DEX also reduced cellular apoptosis both in white and gray matters. This effect correlated with the ability of DEX to accelerate behavioral recovery of function measured by a combined behavioral score. These data suggest that reduction of p75NTR in SCI may be a therapeutic strategy to limit cell and tissue damage and therefore to improve recovery of function in SCI patients.","dexamethasone","pubmed"

For the first time, similar methodology also has been applied to study the effects of hypothermia. Canine spinal cords were injured at T13 by use of an epidural balloon and then were treated with local hypothermia or intramuscular dexamethasone or both. Motor recovery was assessed using a modified Tarlov scale. At either 6 days or 7 weeks, spinal cords T8 through L4 were removed and divided into 10 ordered blocks, which were analyzed for wet and dry weight, potassium concentration, and sodium concentration. Correlations between clinical motor and chemical results were evaluated. The conclusions drawn are as follows: 1) The canine severe rapid compressive injury model, unlike the previously published less severe feline impact injury model, is not associated with widespread early loss of spinal cord tissue potassium content (dry weight). 2) The dog compressive model, unlike the cat impact model, does not provide evidence that one fundamental mechanism of the confirmed beneficial action of steroids entails enhanced early preservation of tissue potassium content. 3) At 6 days, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and increase in sodium concentration, representing edema, occurred at and adjacent to the direct compression site in all lesioned dog groups except those treated with dexamethasone, demonstrating an antiedema effect of dexamethasone that was nullified by concurrent local hypothermia. 4) This antiedema effect of dexamethasone was associated with superior early motor improvement but did not lead to superior long-term function, in comparison with hypothermia. 5) At 7 weeks, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and potassium concentration, and increase in sodium concentration, all restricted to the directly compressed segment, signify necrosis. 6) This new chemical index of necrosis was highly correlated with clinical motor performance.","dexamethasone","pubmed"

Medical therapy consisted of intravenous mannitol, dexamethasone, and sodium bicarbonate given during the acute phase of the injury. Both groups were immobilized using either a halo or a Philadelphia collar. Criteria for entry into the surgical group were one or both of the following: (a) failure to improve progressively after an initial period of improvement, with persistent compression of neural tissue visualized on myelography and (b) unacceptable instability of the spinal bony elements. The patients were given neurological scores based on the motor power of the major muscle groups. The stability of the spine was scored using the Panjabi-White scale.

Most injuries (77%) resulted from degenerative disk disease, occurring at or near the thoracolumbar junction, and producing chronic, complete paraplegia. Neurological examination of each dog was recorded on videotape before and at intervals after administration of 4-AP. The drug was administered systemically in total doses between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg body weight. Three areas of neurological status changed significantly at 15-45 minutes following administration of 4-AP: (a) striking improvements in hindlimb placing occurred in 18 animals; (b) increased awareness of painful stimuli to the hindlimb in 10 animals; (c) partial recovery of the cutaneus trunci muscle reflex of the back skin in 9 animals. These effects reversed within a few hours of administration. Other animals (36%) showed no change in neurological signs except a slight enhancement of hindlimb reflex tone. Significant side effects were seen in 6 dogs receiving higher intravenous doses, with elevation of body temperature and apparent anxiety, leading to mild seizures in 3 of the animals.

Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knock-out (KO) mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wild-type (WT) mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 h post-SCI. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of KOs at 24 h post-injury. To complement these findings with KO mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels.

Diclofenac administration to injured WT mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of KOs but did not improve recovery in KOs. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 h post-SCI.

To examine the relevance of these findings to neurotrauma, we conducted electrophysiological studies with inorganic Ca(2+) channels blockers and L- and N-subtype-specific calcium channel antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury. Confocal immunohistochemistry was used to examine for localization of L- and N-type calcium channels in spinal cord white matter tracts. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber and injured with a modified clip (2g closing force) for 15s. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential at two points with glass microelectrodes. The compound action potential decreased to 71.4+/-2.0% of control (P<0. 05) after spinal cord injury. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) promoted significantly greater recovery of compound action potential amplitude (86.3+/-7.6% of control; P< 0.05) after injury. Partial blockade of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels with cobalt (20 microM) or cadmium (200 microM) conferred improvement in compound action potential amplitude. Application of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers diltiazem (50 microM) or verapamil (90 microM), and the N-type antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM), significantly enhanced the recovery of compound action potential amplitude postinjury. Co-application of the L-type antagonist diltiazem with the N-type blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA showed significantly greater (P<0.05) improvement in compound action potential amplitude than application of either drug alone. Confocal immunohistochemistry with double labelling for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GalC and NF200 demonstrated L- and N-type Ca(2+) channels on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not axons, in spinal cord white matter. In conclusion, the injurious effects of Ca(2+) in traumatic central nervous system white matter injury appear to be partially mediated by voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.

Spinal cord injury impaired cognitive function, which was associated with reduced dopamine receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex. The effect of spinal cord injury (SCI) has been studied widely in paraplegia and motor areas of the brain, but its mechanisms in memory and cognitive impairment remain controversial. Here, we focused on the impact of SCI on prefrontal performance via dopamine levels and receptors. We divided 18 male rats into three groups, i.e. control, laminectomy and SCI groups. Laminectomy and SCI were induced at T10 of the spinal cord. One week later, after locomotor recovery, the novel object recognition and T-maze (spontaneous alternation) tests were applied. After behavioural assessments, the rats were killed and their brain tissues harvested. According to the behavioural findings, cognitive function was impaired in the SCI group (P < 0.05). Also, SCI significantly increased the dopamine level and decreased the expression of dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex 2 weeks after injury (P < 0.05). Given the role of dopamine in cognition, SCI could impair novel object recognition and spatial working memory via dopaminergic systems.","dopamine","pubmed"

We aimed to determine the effects of optimizing spinal cord perfusion on neurological recovery and risks for adverse events. We searched multiple databases for published and unpublished reports. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. We synthesized data and evaluated confidence in anticipated treatment effects according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We identified 20 eligible observational studies and 1 eligible randomized controlled trial. According to low or very low quality evidence, the effect of MAP support on neurological recovery after acute traumatic spinal cord injury is uncertain, and the use of vasopressors to support MAP may be associated with increased rates of predominantly cardiac adverse events. Increased SCPP appears likely to be associated with improved neurological recovery, but SCPP monitoring via intradural catheters at the anatomical site of injury may involve increased risks of cerebrospinal fluid leakage requiring revision surgery or pseudomeningocele. No study directly compared the effects of specific MAP goal ranges, SCPP ranges, SCPP monitoring techniques, or durations of treatment. Very low quality evidence suggests that norepinephrine may have less risk of adverse events than dopamine. The current literature is insufficient to make strong recommendations about interventions to support spinal cord perfusion via MAP or SCPP goals in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries. Data are compatible with a variety of treatment decisions, and individualized approaches may be optimal. Further investigation to clarify the risks, benefits, and alternatives to MAP or SCPP support in this population is warranted.","dopamine","pubmed"

A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.","dopamine","pubmed"

The striatal A2AR-D2R heteromer has a tetrameric structure and forms part of a signaling complex that includes a Gs and a Gi protein and the effector adenyl cyclase (subtype AC5). Another target of caffeine, the adenosine A1 receptor-dopamine D1 receptor (A1R-D1R) heteromer, seems to have a very similar structure. Initially suggested to be localized in the striatum, the A1R-D1R heteromer has now been identified in the spinal motoneuron and shown to mediate the spinally generated caffeine-induced locomotion. In this study, we review the recently discovered properties of A2AR-D2R and A1R-D1R heteromers. Our studies demonstrate that these complexes are a necessary condition to sustain the canonical antagonistic interaction between a Gs-coupled receptor (A2AR or D1R) and a Gi-coupled receptor (D2R or A1R) at the adenylyl cyclase level, which constitutes a new concept in the field of G protein-coupled receptor physiology and pharmacology. A2AR antagonists targeting the striatal A2AR-D2R heteromer are already being considered as therapeutic agents in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we review the preclinical evidence that indicates that caffeine and A2AR antagonists could be used to treat the motivational symptoms of depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, while A1R antagonists selectively targeting the spinal A1R-D1R heteromer could be used in the recovery of spinal cord injury.","dopamine","pubmed"

We have recently reported that the locomotor CPG in neonatal mice rapidly recovers the ability to produce neurochemically induced fictive locomotion following an upper lumbar spinal cord compression injury. Here we address the question of recovery of multi-rhythmic activity and the serotonin-sensitivity of the CPG. In isolated spinal cords from control and 3 days post-injury mice, application of dopamine and NMDA elicited multi-rhythmic activity with slow and fast components. The slow component comprised 10-20 s episodes of activity that were synchronous in ipsilateral or all lumbar ventral roots, and the fast components involved bursts within these episodes that displayed coordinated patterns of alternation between ipsilateral roots. Rhythm strength was the same in control and injured spinal cords. However, power spectral analysis of signal within episodes showed a reduced peak frequency after recovery. In control spinal cords, serotonin triggered fictive locomotion only when applied at high concentration (30 µM, constant NMDA). By contrast, in about 50% of injured preparations fictive locomotion was evoked by 2-3 times lower serotonin concentrations (10-15 µM). This increased serotonin sensitivity was correlated with post-injury changes in the expression of specific serotonin receptor transcripts, but not of dopamine receptor transcripts.","dopamine","pubmed"

We recently found that a crushed spinal cord lesion can minimize fibrotic scarring and grafted cell death compared with open-dura injuries. To determine if this SCI model is applicable for studying cardiovascular recovery, we examined hemodynamic consequences following crushed SCI and tested cardiovascular responses to serotonin (5-HT) or dopamine (DA) receptor agonists. Using a radio-telemetric system, multiple cardiovascular parameters were recorded prior to, 2, and 4 weeks after SCI, including resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), as well as spontaneous or colorectal distension (CRD)-induced autonomic dysreflexia (AD). The results showed that this injury caused tachycardia at rest as well as the occurrence of spontaneous or artificially induced dysreflexic events. Four weeks post-injury, specific activation of 5-HT2A receptors by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intrathecal (i.t.) delivery of Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) remarkably increased resting MAP levels in a dose-dependent fashion. During CRD-induced autonomic dysreflexia, systemic administration of DOI alleviated the severity of bradycardia responsive to episodic hypertension. In contrast, selective stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors with 8-OH-DPAT or non-selective activation of DA receptors with apomorphine did not affect cardiovascular performance. Thus, crush injuries induce cardiovascular abnormalities in rats that are sensitive to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation, indicating a reliable SCI model to study how cell-based approaches impact the severity of autonomic dysreflexia and identify a possible target for pharmacological interventions.","dopamine","pubmed"

Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.","dopamine","pubmed"

Improving neurological recovery by reducing secondary injury is a major principle in the management of SCI. To minimize secondary injury, blood pressure (BP) augmentation has been advocated. The objective of this study was to review the evidence behind BP management after SCI. METHODS This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Using the PubMed database, the authors identified studies that investigated BP management after acute SCI. Information on BP goals, duration of BP management, vasopressor selection, and neurological outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Eleven studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. Nine studies were retrospective, and 2 were single-cohort prospective investigations. Of the 9 retrospective studies, 7 reported a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of higher than 85 mm Hg. For the 2 prospective studies, the MAP goals were higher than 85 mm Hg and higher than 90 mm Hg. The duration of BP management varied from more than 24 hours to 7 days in 6 of the retrospective studies that reported the duration of treatment. In both prospective studies, the duration of treatment was 7 days. In the 2 prospective studies, neurological outcomes were stable to improved with BP management. The retrospective studies, however, were contradictory with regard to the correlation of BP management and outcomes. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were the agents that were frequently used to augment BP. However, more complications have been associated with dopamine use than with the other vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS There are no high-quality data regarding optimal BP goals and duration in the management of acute SCI. Based on the highest level of evidence available from the 2 prospective studies, MAP goals of 85-90 mm Hg for a duration of 5-7 days should be considered. Norepinephrine for cervical and upper thoracic injuries and phenylephrine or norepinephrine for mid- to lower thoracic injuries should be considered.","dopamine","pubmed"

Behavioural recovery is evident within a few days and approaches normal function within about 3 weeks. Fictive locomotion in the isolated injured spinal cord cannot be elicited by a neurochemical cocktail containing NMDA, dopamine and serotonin 1 day post-injury, but can 3 days post-injury as readily as in the uninjured spinal cord. Low frequency coordinated rhythmic activity can be elicited in the isolated uninjured spinal cord by NMDA + dopamine (without serotonin), but not in the isolated injured spinal cord. In both the injured and uninjured spinal cord, eliciting bona fide fictive locomotion requires the additional presence of serotonin. Following incomplete compression injury in the thoracic spinal cord of neonatal mice 1 day after birth (P1), we previously reported that virtually normal hindlimb locomotor function is recovered within about 3 weeks despite substantial permanent thoracic tissue loss. Here, we asked whether similar recovery occurs following lumbar injury that impacts more directly on the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). As in thoracic injuries, lumbar injuries caused about 90% neuronal loss at the injury site and increased serotonergic innervation below the injury. Motor recovery was slower after lumbar than thoracic injury, but virtually normal function was attained by P25 in both cases. Locomotor CPG status was tested by eliciting fictive locomotion in isolated spinal cords using a widely used neurochemical cocktail (NMDA, dopamine, serotonin). No fictive locomotion could be elicited 1 day post-injury, but could within 3 days post-injury as readily as in age-matched uninjured control spinal cords. Burst patterning and coordination were largely similar in injured and control spinal cords but there were differences. Notably, in both groups there were two main locomotor frequencies, but injured spinal cords exhibited a shift towards the higher frequency. Injury also altered the neurochemical dependence of locomotor CPG output, such that injured spinal cords, unlike control spinal cords, were incapable of generating low frequency rhythmic coordinated activity in the presence of NMDA and dopamine alone. Thus, the neonatal spinal cord also exhibits remarkable functional recovery after lumbar injuries, but the neurochemical sensitivity of locomotor circuitry is modified in the process.","dopamine","pubmed"

Although traditionally it is believed that in mammalian spinal cord, monoamine neurotransmitters mainly originate from the brain, accumulating evidence indicates that especially when the spinal cord is injured, they can also be produced in the spinal cord. In this review, I will present evidence for a possible pathway for two-step synthesis of dopamine and serotonin in the spinal cord. Published data from different sources and unpublished data from my own ongoing projects indicate that monoenzymatic cells expressing aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) are present in the spinal cord and that these TH and THP cells often lie in close proximity to AADC cells. Prompted by the above evidence, I hypothesize that dopamine and serotonin could be synthesized sequentially in two monoenzymatic cells in the spinal cord via a TH-AADC and a TPH-AADC cascade respectively. The monoamines synthesized through this pathway may compensate for lost neurotransmitters following spinal cord injury and also may play specific roles in the recovery of sensory, motor and autonomic functions.","dopamine","pubmed"

DA-mediated regulation of urinary activity is considered to occur through an interaction between midbrain DA neurons and the pontine micturition center. Here we show that DA is produced in the rat spinal cord and modulates the bladder reflex. We observed numerous tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons in the autonomic nuclei and superficial dorsal horn in L6-S3 spinal segments. These neurons are dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH)- and some contain detectable dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), suggesting their capacity to produce DA. Interestingly, following a complete thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) to interrupt supraspinal projections, more TH+ neurons emerged in the lumbosacral spinal cord, coincident with a sustained, low level of DA expression there and a partially recovered micturition reflex. Non-selective blockade of spinal DA receptors reduced bladder activity whereas activation of spinal D2-like receptors increased bladder activity and facilitated voiding. Additionally, depletion of lumbosacral TH+ neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) decreased bladder non-voiding contractions and voiding efficiency. Furthermore, injecting the transsynaptic neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the bladder detrusor labeled TH+ cells in the lumbosacral cord, confirming their involvement in spinal micturition reflex circuits. These results illustrate that DA is synthesized in the rat spinal cord; plasticity of lumbosacral TH+ neurons following SCI may contribute to DA expression and modulate the spinal bladder reflex. Thus, spinally-derived DA and receptors could be a novel therapeutic target to improve micturition recovery after SCI.","dopamine","pubmed"

Furthermore, 71.43% of patients with penetrating SCI treated with vasopressors experienced associated cardiogenic complications.

The first goal of the current study was to establish the effects of chronic SCI on the function of the spinal ejaculation generator. Male rats received a contusion injury of the spinal cord at spinal level T6-T7. Ejaculatory reflexes elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsal penile nerve (DPN) were evaluated in injured and control rats at 4-6 weeks following SCI. SCI males demonstrated significant reductions in bursting of the bulbocavernosus muscle (BCM), an indicator for expulsion phase of ejaculation, and in seminal vesicle pressure (SVP) increases, an indicator for the emission phase of ejaculation, following DPN stimulation. Thus, contusion SCI resulted in long-term impairment of ejaculatory reflexes. The D3 agonist 7-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (7OHDPAT) facilitates ejaculation in spinal cord intact rats, thus the second goal of the current study was to test whether subcutaneous infusions of 7OHDPAT can facilitate ejaculatory reflexes in rats with chronic SCI.

Results showed that 7OHDPAT administration facilitated ejaculatory reflexes in SCI males with or without DPN stimulation, provided that supraspinal inputs to the lumbar cord were severed by transection just prior to evaluating the reflex. Thus, 7OHDPAT administration in SCI males was able to overcome the detrimental effects of SCI on ejaculatory reflexes.","dopamine","pubmed"

We observed that immediately after nerve cord transection leeches were unable to crawl, but remarkably, after a day to weeks, animals began to show elements of crawling and intersegmental coordination. Over a similar time course, excessive swimming due to the loss of descending inhibition returned to control levels. Additionally, removal of the brain did not prevent crawl recovery, indicating that connectivity of severed descending neurons was not essential. After crawl recovery, a subset of animals received a second transection immediately below the anterior-most ganglion remaining. Similar to their initial transection, a loss of crawling with subsequent recovery was observed. These data, in recovered individuals, support the idea that compensatory plasticity directly below the site of injury is essential for the initiation and coordination of crawling.

We then move to a discussion of dopamine's role in modulation of swimming in aquatic species such as the larval xenopus, lamprey and zebrafish. The control of terrestrial walking in vertebrates by dopamine is less studied and we review current evidence in mammals with a focus on rodent species. We discuss data suggesting that the source of dopamine within the spinal cord is mainly from the A11 area of the diencephalon, and then turn to a discussion of dopamine's role in modulating walking patterns from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. Similar to the descending serotonergic system, the dopaminergic system may serve as a potential target to promote recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury (SCI); evidence suggests that dopaminergic agonists can promote recovery of function following SCI. We discuss pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches that could be deployed in SCI and their potential tractability. Throughout the review we draw parallels with both noradrenergic and serotonergic modulatory effects on spinal cord networks. In all likelihood, a complementary monoaminergic enhancement strategy should be deployed following SCI.","dopamine","pubmed"

In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/α1 receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and α1 receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.","dopamine","pubmed"

Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-Séquard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries.","dopamine","pubmed"

Derived from microbial organisms, opsin genes encoding light-activated ion channels and pumps (channelrhodopsin-2 [ChR2]; halorhodopsin [NpHR], respectively), engineered for expression in the mammalian brain, can be genetically targeted into specific neural populations using viral vectors. When exposed to light with appropriate wavelength, action potentials can be triggered in ChR2-expressing neurons, whereas inhibition of action potentials can be obtained in NpHR-expressing neurons, thus allowing for powerful control of neural activity. Optogenetics is now intensively used in laboratory animals, both in vitro and in vivo, for exploring functions of complex neural circuits and information processing in the normal brain and during various neurological conditions. The clinical perspectives of adopting optogenetics as a novel treatment strategy for human neurological disorders have generated considerable interest, largely because of the enormous potential demonstrated in recent rodent and nonhuman primate studies.

Spinal cord injury studies use the presence of noradrenergic (NA) axons caudal to the injury site as evidence of axonal regeneration and we previously found more NA axons just caudal to the transection in OEG- than media-injected spinal rats. We therefore hypothesized that OEG transplantation promotes descending coeruleospinal regeneration that contributes to the recovery of hindlimb locomotion. Now we report that NA axons are present throughout the caudal stump of both media- and OEG-injected spinal rats and they enter the spinal cord from the periphery via dorsal and ventral roots and along large penetrating blood vessels. These results indicate that the presence of NA fibers in the caudal spinal cord is not a reliable indicator of coeruleospinal regeneration. We then asked if NA axons appose cholinergic neurons associated with motor functions, i.e., central canal cluster and partition cells (active during fictive locomotion) and somatic motor neurons (SMNs). We found more NA varicosities adjacent to central canal cluster cells, partition cells, and SMNs in the lumbar enlargement of OEG- than media-injected rats. As non-synaptic release of NA is common in the spinal cord, more associations between NA varicosities and motor-associated cholinergic neurons in the lumbar spinal cord may contribute to the improved treadmill stepping observed in OEG-injected spinal rats. This effect could be mediated through direct association with SMNs and/or indirectly via cholinergic interneurons.","dopamine","pubmed"

However, only partial central network-activating effects were found with single molecules since none administered separately could elicit weight-bearing and functional stepping movements in Tx animals. In turn, a recent breakthrough revealed that full spinal locomotor network-activating effects may be induced with synergistic drug combinations. Indeed, specific cocktails comprising some of these agonists and precursors were found, indeed, to powerfully generate weight-bearing stepping with plantar foot placement in untrained, non-assisted and non-sensory-stimulated Tx mice. This significant finding provides clear evidence suggesting that combinatorial approaches based on drug-drug synergistic interactions may constitute innovative solutions for the design and development of novel pharmacological therapies in the field of SCI and related neurological disorders.","dopamine","pubmed"

Olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) express a variety of growth factors and cell adhesion molecules and promote axonal regrowth and functional recovery in spinal cord injury in animal models and patients. In the present study, we explored the possibility to increase the survival, function, axonal outgrowth and striatal reinnervation of NSC by co-grafting with OEC in 6-OHDA lesioned parkinsonian rats. In the presence of OEC, significantly enhanced survival of NSC-derived DA neurons and axonal fiber outgrowth was evident in the striatum of NSC+OEC co-grafted rats at 24 weeks post-grafting as compared with NSC alone grafted rats. The increased survival of NSC and their striatal reinnervation was further manifested in the form of significant and substantial restitution of motor function and neurochemical recovery in the co-grafted group. Significant enhanced expression of p75NTR (from OEC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (from NSC) confirmed the co-localization and survival of both types of cells at the transplantation site in co-grafted rats. Co-grafting results co-related well with our in vitro studies, which suggest that OEC not only significantly increase survival, neurite outgrowth and DA release of NSC-derived DA neuron but also protect against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity in co-culture conditions. These results collectively suggest that OEC increase the survival and function of transplanted NSC in 6-OHDA lesioned parkinsonian rats.","dopamine","pubmed"

We used immunohistochemistry to investigate distal plasticity of serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways that have been shown to modulate locomotion. After SCI, pups exhibited an expected decrease in monoaminergic innervation of the lumbosacral cord, consistent with partial loss of these descending pathways. Unlike published results for the adult, we found no evidence of partial reinnervation with time after injury. On the other hand, oligodendrocytes at and near the lesion epicenter of the young rats appeared unexpectedly resilient to the insult. No evidence of oligodendrocyte loss in spared white matter was detected at 24 h after injury, as compared to the 50% loss reported in adults. Rather, there was a significant increase in the density of oligodendrocytes by 5 days after injury that was associated with a dramatic upregulation of markers for glial progenitor cells after pup SCI. Our results suggest that an altered glial response near the injury epicenter as compared to that in adults is likely to contribute to the more rapid rate of recovery in hindlimb locomotor function in young rats after SCI.","dopamine","pubmed"

We co-grafted VM with either OEC or astrocytes derived from the same olfactory bulbs as the OEC to rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal system.

Grafting OEC or astrocytes alone had no effects. Intriguingly, only in the presence of OEC co-grafts, did dopamine neurons extend strikingly long neurites that reached peripheral striatal compartments. Comparable results were observed in a co-culture system where OEC promoted dopamine cell survival and neurite elongation through a mechanism involving both releasable factors and direct contact. Cell type analysis of fetal VM grafts suggested that dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra rather than of the ventral tegmental area were increased in the presence of OEC co-grafts.

Much research has been done in rodents, and a few studies have been done in nonhuman primate models. Early uncontrolled clinical reports were enthusiastic, but the outcome of the first randomized, double blind, controlled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure Parkinson's disease, although there were some significant positive findings. Were the earlier animal studies and clinical reports wrong? Should we give up on the goal? Some aspects of the trial design and implantation methods may have led to lack of effects and to some side effects such as dyskinesias. But a detailed review of clinical neural transplants published to date still suggests that neural transplantation variably reverses some aspects of Parkinson's disease, although differing methods make exact comparisons difficult. While the randomized clinical studies have been in progress, new methods have shown promise for increasing transplant survival and distribution, reconstructing the circuits to provide dopamine to the appropriate targets and with normal regulation. Selected promising new strategies are reviewed that block apoptosis induced by tissue dissection, promote vascularization of grafts, reduce oxidant stress, provide key growth factors, and counteract adverse effects of increased age. New sources of replacement cells and stem cells may provide additional advantages for the future.

We tested this approach using a recently developed a mammalian SCI model of chronic central pain, which results in development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. Thirty day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally hemisected at T13 and allowed 4 weeks for recovery of locomotor function and development of allodynia. Nonimmunosuppressed injured animals received either control-striated muscle (n = 7) or AM (n = 10) transplants.

In man, repetitive electrical stimulation via epidural electrodes increases plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, and CSF levels of norepinephrine. Repetitive electrical stimulation in man dates back to 1967 and has been used for the control of pain, to improve spasticity, bladder control, motor deficit and the autonomic hyperreflexia of spinal cord injury. In addition, improvement has been reported in epilepsy, cerebral palsy, torticollis and peripheral vascular diseases. The best controlled studies are in multiple sclerosis and peripheral vascular disease, and these results will be presented in more detail.","dopamine","pubmed"

We previously identified the transcription factor SOX9 as a key up-regulator of CSPG production and also demonstrated that conditional Sox9 ablation leads to decreased CSPG levels and improved recovery of hind limb function after SCI. We herein demonstrate increased neural input onto spinal neurons caudal to the lesion in spinal cord injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice as indicated by increased levels of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) compared to controls. Axonal sparing, long-range axonal regeneration and reactive sprouting were investigated as possible explanations for the increase in neural inputs caudal to the lesion and for the improved locomotor outcomes in spinal cord-injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice. Whereas retrograde tract-tracing studies failed to reveal any evidence for increased axonal sparing or for long-range regeneration in the Sox9 conditional knock out mice, anterograde tract-tracing experiments demonstrated increased reactive sprouting caudal to the lesion after SCI. Finally we demonstrate that application of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor to reduce CSPG degradation in Sox9 conditional knock out mice prevents the improvements in locomotor recovery observed in untreated Sox9 conditional knock out mice. These results suggest that improved recovery of locomotor function in Sox9 conditional knock out mice after SCI is due to increased reactive sprouting secondary to reduced CSPG levels distal to the lesion.","doxycycline","pubmed"

Efficient delivery of chondroitinase ABC to the injured mammalian spinal cord can be achieved by viral vector transgene delivery. This approach dramatically modulates injury pathology and restores sensorimotor functions. However, clinical development of this therapy is limited by a lack of ability to exert control over chondroitinase gene expression. Prior experimental gene regulation platforms are likely to be incompatible with the non-resolving adaptive immune response known to occur following spinal cord injury. Therefore, here we apply a novel immune-evasive dual vector system, in which the chondroitinase gene is under a doxycycline inducible regulatory switch, utilizing a chimeric transactivator designed to evade T cell recognition. Using this novel vector system, we demonstrate tight temporal control of chondroitinase ABC gene expression, effectively removing treatment upon removal of doxycycline. This enables a comparison of short and long-term gene therapy paradigms in the treatment of clinically-relevant cervical level contusion injuries in adult rats. We reveal that transient treatment (2.5 weeks) is sufficient to promote improvement in sensory axon conduction and ladder walking performance. However, in tasks requiring skilled reaching and grasping, only long term treatment (8 weeks) leads to significantly improved function, with rats able to accurately grasp and retrieve sugar pellets. The late emergence of skilled hand function indicates enhanced neuroplasticity and connectivity and correlates with increased density of vGlut1+ innervation in spinal cord grey matter, particularly in lamina III-IV above and below the injury. Thus, our novel gene therapy system provides an experimental tool to study temporal effects of extracellular matrix digestion as well as an encouraging step towards generating a safer chondroitinase gene therapy strategy, longer term administration of which increases neuroplasticity and recovery of descending motor control. This preclinical study could have a significant impact for tetraplegic individuals, for whom recovery of hand function is an important determinant of independence, and supports the ongoing development of chondroitinase gene therapy towards clinical application for the treatment of spinal cord injury.","doxycycline","pubmed"

Controlled expression of L1 is desired because overexpression after regenerative events may lead to adverse consequences. The regulated system was tested in several cell lines, where doxycycline completely eliminated green fluorescent protein or L1 expression by 3-5 days in vitro. Increased colony formation as well as decreased proliferation were observed in H9NSCs without doxycycline (hL1-on). To test the role of L1 in vivo after acute compression spinal cord injury of immunosuppressed mice, quantum dot labeled hL1-on or hL1-off cells were injected at three sites: lesion; proximal; and caudal. Mice transplanted with hL1-on cells showed a better Basso Mouse Scale score, when compared to those with hL1-off cells. As compared to the hL1-off versus hL1-on cell transplanted mice 6 weeks post-transplantation, expression levels of L1, migration of transplanted cells, and immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase were higher, whereas expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was lower. Results indicate that L1 expression is regulatable in human stem cells by doxycycline in a nonviral engineering approach. Regulatable expression in a prospective nonleaky Tet-off system could hold promise for therapy, based on the multifunctional roles of L1, including neuronal migration and survival, neuritogenesis, myelination, and synaptic plasticity.","doxycycline","pubmed"

The MEPs were recorded and the relationship between the variation of the MEPs and the residual locomotor capacity after spinal cord injury was analyzed. The 6 rabbits in mild-spinal-cord-injury group experienced transient attenuation of their TMS-MEPs, and the locomotor capacity remained intact (scores of 5) in almost all rabbits (5 of 6) when assessed 24 hours later; In the moderate-spinal-cord-injury group the 8 rabbits lost their TMS-MEP immediately after the weight-drop contusion, but they regained them partly in 1 hour one after another and scored 4 or 5 in the assessment of muscle power next day except for one score of 2; 8 rabbits had their spinal cords impaired severely in the contusion procedure and lost their TMS-MEP too but without recovery, their locomotor capacity outcomes were very poor, 5 of them had no response to transcranial magnetic stimulation next day, and in the other 3 rabbits we only found some polyphase waves with variant latency and lower amplitude which did not resemble common compound muscle action potential (CMAPs) evoked by TMS. Myogenic TMS-MEPs was very sensitive to the spinal cord injury and should be a valid technique for intraoperative monitoring, and a slight change of them, even if a transient lose, should be unnecessarily related to a severe movement disorder.

Peripheral nerve injury impairs motor, sensory, and autonomic functions, particularly in cases where nerve gaps are large and chronic nerve injury ensues. Previous studies have indicated that the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 constitutes a viable target to promote regeneration after acute injury. We screened libraries of known drugs for small molecule agonists of L1 and evaluated the effect of hit compounds in cell-based assays in vitro and in mice after femoral nerve and spinal cord injuries in vivo. We identified eight small molecule L1 agonists and showed in cell-based assays that they stimulate neuronal survival, neuronal migration, and neurite outgrowth and enhance Schwann cell proliferation and migration and myelination of neurons in an L1-dependent manner. In a femoral nerve injury mouse model, enhanced functional regeneration and remyelination after application of the L1 agonists were observed. In a spinal cord injury mouse model, L1 agonists improved recovery of motor functions, being paralleled by enhanced remyelination, neuronal survival, and monoaminergic innervation, reduced astrogliosis, and activation of microglia. Together, these findings suggest that application of small organic compounds that bind to L1 and stimulate the beneficial homophilic L1 functions may prove to be a valuable addition to treatments of nervous system injuries.","duloxetine","pubmed"

To characterize static and dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) of individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) compared to able-bodied controls in response to moderate increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) caused by mild whole-body cold stress. Japan METHODS: Five men with complete autonomic cervical SCI (sustained > 5 y) and six age-matched able-bodied men participated in hemodynamic, temperature, catecholamine and respiratory measurements for 60 min during three consecutive stages: baseline (10 min; 33 °C water through a thin-tubed whole-body suit), mild cold stress (20 min; 25 °C water), and post-cold recovery (30 min; 33 °C water). Static CA was determined as the ratio between mean changes in middle cerebral artery blood velocity and MAP, dynamic CA as transfer function coherence, gain, and phase between spontaneous changes in MAP to middle cerebral artery blood velocity. MAP increased in both groups during cold and post-cold recovery (mean differences: 5-10 mm Hg; main effect of time: p = 0.001). Static CA was not different between the able-bodied vs. the cervical SCI group (mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) of between-group difference: -4 (-11 to 3) and -2 (-5 to 1) cm/s/mm Hg for cold (p = 0.22) and post-cold (p = 0.24), respectively). At baseline, transfer function phase was shorter in the cervical SCI group (mean (95% CI) of between-group difference: 0.6 (0.2 to 1.0) rad; p = 0.006), while between-group differences in changes in phase were not different in response to the cold stress (interaction term: p = 0.06). This pilot study suggests that static CA is similar between individuals with cervical SCI and able-bodied controls in response to moderate increases in MAP, while dynamic CA may be impaired in cervical SCI because of disturbed sympathetic control.","epinephrine","pubmed"

Neurophysiological and neuroprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A novel implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system enables targeted drug delivery and induction of temporary paraplegia in awake, behaving nonhuman primates.

To reduce allodynia, it would be desirable to implant a permanent biological pump such as adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (AM), which secrete catecholamines and opioid peptides, both antinociceptive substances, near the spinal cord. We tested this approach using a recently developed a mammalian SCI model of chronic central pain, which results in development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. Thirty day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally hemisected at T13 and allowed 4 weeks for recovery of locomotor function and development of allodynia. Nonimmunosuppressed injured animals received either control-striated muscle (n = 7) or AM (n = 10) transplants. Nociceptive behavior was tested for 4 weeks posttransplant as measured by paw withdrawals to von Frey filaments, radiant heat, and pin prick stimuli. Hemisected animals receiving AM demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both fore- and hindlimb mechanical and thermal allodynia, but not analgesia, when compared to hemisected animals receiving striated muscle transplants (P < 0.05). Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity indicated prolonged transplant survival and production of catecholamines. HPLC analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples from animals receiving AM transplants demonstrated statistically significant increases in levels of dopamine (sevenfold), norepinephrine (twofold), and epinephrine (threefold), compared to control values several weeks following transplant (P < 0.05). By 28 days posttransplant, however, antinociceptive effects were diminished.

In Study 1, TM (40 min/day, 5 days/week, beginning 1 week postsurgery) did not prevent SCI-induced hindlimb cancellous bone loss after 3 weeks. In Study 2, TM did not attenuate SCI-induced plantar flexor muscles atrophy nor improve locomotor recovery after 4 weeks. In our main study, SCI produced extensive distal femur and proximal tibia cancellous bone deficits, a deleterious slow-to-fast fiber-type transition in soleus, lower muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), impaired muscle force production, and levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle atrophy after 8 weeks. TE alone (7.0 mg/week) suppressed bone resorption, attenuated cancellous bone loss, constrained the soleus fiber-type transition, and prevented LABC atrophy. In comparison, TE+TM concomitantly suppressed bone resorption and stimulated bone formation after SCI, produced near-complete cancellous bone preservation, prevented the soleus fiber-type transition, attenuated soleus fCSA atrophy, maintained soleus force production, and increased LABC mass. 75% of SCI+TE+TM animals recovered voluntary over-ground hindlimb stepping, while no SCI and only 20% of SCI+TE animals regained stepping ability. Positive associations between testosterone and locomotor function suggest that TE influenced locomotor recovery. In conclusion, short-term TM alone did not improve bone, muscle, or locomotor recovery in adult rats after severe SCI, while longer-term TE+TM provided more comprehensive musculoskeletal benefit than TE alone.","estradiol","pubmed"

This could be due to the enormous innervation of the spinocerebellar tract from the posterior gray horn in the spinal cord to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Although the neuroprotective role of estradiol in spinal cord (SC) injuries, as well as its ability to delay secondary cell death changes, is well-known, its effect on cerebellar layers is not fully investigated. In this study, a SCI model was achieved by injection of Kainic acid into SC of adult Male Wistar rats in order to assess the effects of SCI on the cerebellum. The animals were classified into SCI group (animals with SCI), estradiol-treated group (animals with SCI and received estradiol), control groups, and sham control group. The microscopical examination 24 h after induction of SCI revealed that KA induced the most characteristics of neurodegeneration including astrocytic propagation and microglial activation. The estradiol was injected intraperitoneally 20 min after induction of SCI, and the samples were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days. Histologically, the estradiol reduced the inflammatory response, enhanced the recovery of molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell layers, and therefore aided in the restoration of layer organization. These findings were also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and gene expression profiling.","estradiol","pubmed"

In the current study, we evaluated the roles of E2 administration before SCs transplantation in targeting SCI-induced axonal degeneration and demyelination. E2 (25 µg/kg, IP) was administered to the male Wistar rats underwent contusive SCI at T10 segment. At 7 days after injury, 1 × 106 SCs were transplanted to the injury epicenter of the spinal cord. The groups were laminectomy, SCI, SCI+E2, and SCI+E2+SCs. Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso-Bresnahan-Beattie locomotor test. Sections from spinal cord were also assessed for histoloical staining, including Luxol fast blue, Bielschowsky's silver and immunofluorescence evaluation of myelin basic protein (MBP). The SCI group showed impaired locomotion in the hind limb, increased number of cavities within spinal cord, low observable numbers of regenerating fibers, and a significant decrease in the rate of expression for MBP. These changes were counteracted in the treatment groups ( P < 0.05 vs SCI) with no significant changes among them.

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone.","estradiol","pubmed"

Young adult female rats received either sham or T9 spinal cord contusion injuries and were treated with estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, both, or nothing via Silastic capsules. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor testing was performed weekly and voiding behavior was assessed at 3 weeks post-injury. Four weeks after SCI, lesion volume and tissue sparing, quadriceps muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and motoneuron dendritic morphology were assessed. Spontaneous locomotor behavior improved after SCI, but hormone treatments had no effect. Voiding behavior was disrupted after SCI, but was significantly improved by treatment with either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone; combined treatment was maximally effective. Treatment with estradiol reduced lesion volume, but dihydrotestosterone alone and estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone were ineffective. SCI-induced decreases in motoneuron dendritic length were attenuated by all hormone treatments. SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were prevented by treatment with either dihydrotestosterone or estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone, but estradiol treatment was ineffective.

The inflammatory response initiated by spinal cord injury (SCI) involves the processing of interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and IL-18 mediated by caspase-1 which is under the control of an intracellular multiprotein complex called inflammasome. We recently described in a SCI model that between 24 and 72 h post-injury, most of inflammasome components including IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 are upregulated. In this study, we investigated the influence of E2 treatment after spinal cord contusion on inflammasome regulation. After contusion of T9 spinal segment, 12-week-old male Wistar rats were treated subcutaneously with E2 immediately after injury and every 12 h for the next 3 days. Behavioral scores were significantly improved in E2-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated groups. Functional improvement in E2-treated animals was paralleled by the attenuated expression of certain inflammasome components such as ASC, NLRP1b, and NLRP3 together with IL1b, IL-18, and caspase-1. On the histopathological level, microgliosis and oligodendrocyte injury was ameliorated. These findings support and extend the knowledge of the E2-mediated neuroprotective function during SCI.

The physical trauma to the spinal cord initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generates a non-permissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment. In addition, the effects of Tamoxifen in axonal outgrowth or synapse formation needs to be investigated.

Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 μg 17β-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).","estradiol","pubmed"

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-α mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-α antagonist. We also observed that ER-α was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-α. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-α dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen׳s effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition.","estradiol","pubmed"

The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-staining assay and behavior tests were employed to assess the role of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 in mediating estrogenic protection against spinal cord injury. We show that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 is mainly distributed in the ventral horn and white matter of the spinal cord, which is totally different from nuclear estrogen receptors. We also show that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 is specifically expressed by neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells, but not astrocytes. Furthermore, estrogen treatment prevents spinal cord injury-induced apoptotic cell death and enhances functional recovery after spinal cord injury, which can be mimicked by the specific G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 agonist G-1 and inhibited by specific knockdown of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 expression, but not pure nuclear ER antagonist ICI 182,780.

Therefore, therapeutic approaches to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death after SCI should be considered. Estrogens are well known to have a broad neuroprotective effect, but the protective effect of estrogens on oligodendrocytes after injury is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that 17β-estradiol attenuates apoptosis of oligodendrocytes by inhibiting RhoA and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation after SCI. Estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β were expressed in oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord, and 17β-estradiol treatment significantly inhibited oligodendrocyte cell death at 7 d after injury as compared with vehicle (cyclodextrin) control. 17β-Estradiol also attenuated caspase-3 and -9 activation at 7 d and reduced the loss of axons from progressive degeneration. In addition, 17β-estradiol inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were activated and peaked at 3 and/or 5 d after injury. Furthermore, administration of Rho inhibitor, PEP-1-C3 exoenzyme, inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, and decreased phosphorylated c-Jun level at 5 d after injury. Additionally, the attenuation of RhoA and JNK3 activation as well as oligodendrocyte cell death by 17β-estradiol was reversed by ER antagonist, ICI182780. Our results thus indicate that 17β-estradiol treatment improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing oligodendrocyte cell death via inhibition of RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were ER dependent. Furthermore, improvement of hindlimb motor function by posttreatment of 17β-estradiol suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI patients.","estradiol","pubmed"

In contrast, most experimental models of SCI in rodents induce damage in the thoracic cord, resulting primarily in white matter disruption. To address this disparity, experimental cervical SCI models have been developed. Thus, we used a recently characterized model of cervical hemicontusion SCI in adult male rats to assess the potential therapeutic effect of post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol. Rats received a hemicontusion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra (C5) followed by administration of 17β-estradiol via a slow release pellet (0.5 or 5.0 mg/pellet) beginning at 30 minutes post-SCI. Behavioral evaluation of skilled and unskilled forelimb function and locomotor function were conducted for 7 weeks after SCI. Upon conclusion of the behavioral assessments, spinal cords were collected and histochemistry and stereology were conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on the lesion characteristics. We found that post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol decreased neuronal loss in the ventral horn, decreased reactive astrogliosis, decreased the immune response, and increased white mater sparing at the lesion epicenter. Additionally, post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol improved skilled forelimb function and locomotor function. Taken together, these data suggest that post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol protected both the gray and white matter in cervical SCI. Moreover, this treatment improved function on skilled motor tasks that involve both gray and white matter components, suggesting that this is likely a highly clinically relevant protective strategy.","estradiol","pubmed"

Methylprednisolone, the only currently available therapy renders limited protection in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be tested to maximize neuroprotection and functional recovery. Previous data from our laboratory indicate that estrogen (17β-estradiol) at a high dose may attenuate multiple damaging pathways involved in SCI and improve locomotor outcome. Since use of high dose estrogen may have detrimental side effects and therefore may never be used in the clinic, the current study investigated the efficacy of this steroid hormone at very low doses in SCI. In particular, we tested the impact of dosing (1-10 μg/kg), mode of delivery (intravenous vs. osmotic pump), and delay in estrogen application (15 min-4 h post-SCI) on microgliosis and neuronal death in acute SCI in rats. Treatment with 17β-estradiol (1-10 μg/kg) significantly reduced microglial activation and also attenuated apoptosis of neurons compared to untreated SCI animals. The attenuation of cell death and inflammation by estrogen was observed regardless of mode and time of delivery following injury. These findings suggest estrogen as a potential agent for the treatment of individuals with SCI.","estradiol","pubmed"

Release of cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) was assessed 6 h, 3 days and 1 week post-injury. Reactive astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP and vimentin, and diffusion of CD68-positive inflammatory cells were examined from 3 days to 4 weeks following SCI. Treatment with 17beta-estradiol significantly increased locomotor function from the first week until 4 weeks post-SCI. The injured spinal cord of 17beta-estradiol-treated rats expressed more IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 than controls 6 h after injury. Moreover, 17beta-estradiol-treated rats showed reactive astrocytes as soon as 3 days following SCI, with increased GFAP expression, smaller lesion areas and more limited diffusion of CD68-positive cells after 1 week post-injury compared to controls. The number of CD68-positive cells was also reduced in 17beta-estradiol-treated rats one week post-SCI. However, these differences between 17beta-estradiol-treated and control rats disappeared after 4 weeks. These results suggest that 17beta-estradiol protects the spinal cord by stimulating early cytokines release and astroglial responses. These stimulations may prevent the area of damage from expanding and inflammatory cells to spread in the surrounding tissue during the critical first week following SCI.

Spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy. To gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of E2, the following end points of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) expression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and COX-2; (4) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression); and (5) tissue TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels. In another set of experiments, the pretreatment or posttreatment with E2 significantly ameliorates the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of E2 were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of E2. ICI 182,780 (500 microg/kg, s.c., 1 h before treatment with E2) significantly antagonized the effect of the E2 and abolished the protective effect against SCI.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17beta-estradiol and reproductive aging on motor function, neuronal death, and white matter sparing after SCI of post- and pre-menopausal rats. Two-month-old or 1- year-old female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with a silastic capsule containing 180 microg/mL of 17beta-estradiol or vehicle. Complete crush SCI at T8-9 was performed 1 week later. Additional animals of each age group were left ovary-intact but were spinal cord injured.

Administration of 17beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats improved recovery of hind-limb locomotion, increased white matter sparing, and decreased apoptosis in both the post- and pre-menopausal rats. Also, ovary-intact 1-year-old rats did worse than ovary-intact 2-month-old rats, suggesting that endogenous estrogen confers neuroprotection in young rats, which is lost in older animals.

Estradiol treatment significantly improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Fifteen to 30 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in estradiol-treated (100 microg/kg) rats when compared to vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion sizes increased progressively in either vehicle-treated or 17beta-estradiol-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with 17beta-estradiol, the lesion size was significantly reduced 18-28 days after SCI when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis revealed that apoptotic cell death peaked 24-48 h after injury. Also, SCI induced a marked increase in activated caspase-3 in the spinal cord, evident by 4 h after injury. However, administration of 17beta-estradiol significantly reduced the SCI-induced increase in apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activity after SCI. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol significantly increased expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, bcl-2 and bcl-x, after SCI while expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, bad and bax, was not affected by drug treatment. Finally, intravenous administration of 17beta-estradiol (100 microg/kg) immediately after injury (post-treatment) also significantly improved hind limb motor function 19-30 days after SCI compared to vehicle-treated controls.

Patients with SCI usually exhibit severe clinical symptoms, including sensory and motor dysfunction below the injured levels, paraplegia, quadriplegia and urinary retention, which can exacerbate the substantial medical and social burdens. The major pathological change observed in SCI is inflammatory reaction, which induces demyelination, axonal degeneration, and the apoptosis and necrosis of neurons. Traditional medical treatments are mainly focused on the recovery of motor function and prevention of complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of SCI and have proposed lots of effective treatments, but the clinical applications are still limited due to the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis after SCI. Endocrine hormones are kinds of molecules that are synthesized by specialized endocrine organs and can participate in the regulation of multiple physiological activities, and their protective effects on several disorders have been widely discussed. In addition, many studies have identified that endocrine hormones can promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery in individuals with central nervous system diseases. Therefore, studies investigating the clinical applications of endocrine hormones as treatments for SCI are necessary. In this review, we described the neuroprotective roles of several endocrine hormones in SCI; endocrine hormone administration reduces cell death and promotes functional repair after SCI. We also proposed novel therapies for SCI.","estrogen","pubmed"

When determining how sex affects SCI it remains imperative to expand outcomes beyond locomotor recovery and consider other complications plaguing the quality of life of patients with SCI. Interestingly, the SCI field predominately utilizes female rodents for basic science research which contrasts most other male-biased research fields. We discuss the unique caveats this creates to the translatability of preclinical research in the SCI field. We also review current clinical and preclinical data examining sex as biological variable in SCI. Further, we report how technical considerations such as housing, size, care management, and age, confound the interpretation of sex-specific effects in animal studies of SCI. We have uncovered novel findings regarding how age differentially affects mortality and injury-induced anemia in males and females after SCI, and further identified estrus cycle dysfunction in mice after injury. Emerging concepts underlying sexually dimorphic responses to therapy are also discussed.

Likewise, therapeutic systemic estrogen levels exhibit neuroprotective properties, but dose-dependent side effects are prohibitive. The current study thus uses low-dose estrogen delivery to the spinal cord injury (SCI) site using an agarose gel patch embedded with estrogen-loaded nanoparticles. Compared to controls, spinal cords from rodents treated with nanoparticle site-directed estrogen demonstrated significantly decreased post-injury lesion size, reactive gliosis, and glial scar formation.

However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone.","estrogen","pubmed"

However, it is not known whether and how SRC-1 mediates the neural regeneration promoted by estrogen after SCI. Study of the sex differences and changes of SRC-1 expression after SCI will be helpful to understand the above questions. In this study, the sex differences of expressions of SRC-1 and cytoskeleton-associated protein Profilin-1 in normal and SCI mice were detected by immunohistochemistry at 1-, 3-, and 7 days after injury, respectively. Although the SRC-1 expression in female mice was lower than that in males under normal conditions, its expression in females was more dominant after SCI. The expression of Profilin-1 in both sexes increased first, and then decreased at 3 days after injury. However, there was a second increase in females at 7 days after injury. Our study suggests that the more SRC-1 expression in females after SCI may play a role in improving the efficiency of estrogen function and thus, promote regeneration better.

We recently described in a SCI model that between 24 and 72 h post-injury, most of inflammasome components including IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 are upregulated. In this study, we investigated the influence of E2 treatment after spinal cord contusion on inflammasome regulation.

The physical trauma to the spinal cord initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generates a non-permissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment. In addition, the effects of Tamoxifen in axonal outgrowth or synapse formation needs to be investigated. This review will address some of the mechanisms activated by Tamoxifen after SCI and the results recently published by investigators in the field.","estrogen","pubmed"

Estrogen has been shown to be neuroprotective against SCI through estrogen receptors (ERs), but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the role of a newly found membrane ER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPR30 or GPER1), and discussed the feasibility of a GPR30 agonist as an estrogen replacement. Forty adult female C57BL/6J mice (10-12 weeks old) were divided randomly into vehicle, G-1, E2, G-1 + G-15 and E2 + G-15 groups. All mice were subjected to SCI using a crushing injury approach. The specific GPR30 agonist, G-1, mimicked the effects of E2 treatment by preventing SCI-induced apoptotic cell death and enhancing motor functional recovery after injury. GPR30 activation regulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways, increased GPR30 and anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but decreased the pro-apoptosis factor Bax and cleaved caspase-3. However, the neuroprotective effects of G-1 and E2 were blocked by the specific GPR30 antagonist, G-15. Thus, GPR30 rather than classic ERs is required to induce estrogenic neuroprotective effects. Given that estrogen replacement therapy may cause unexpected side effects, especially on the reproductive system, GPR30 agonists may represent a potential therapeutic approach for treating SCI.","estrogen","pubmed"

We herein demonstrate increased neural input onto spinal neurons caudal to the lesion in spinal cord injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice as indicated by increased levels of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) compared to controls. Axonal sparing, long-range axonal regeneration and reactive sprouting were investigated as possible explanations for the increase in neural inputs caudal to the lesion and for the improved locomotor outcomes in spinal cord-injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice. Whereas retrograde tract-tracing studies failed to reveal any evidence for increased axonal sparing or for long-range regeneration in the Sox9 conditional knock out mice, anterograde tract-tracing experiments demonstrated increased reactive sprouting caudal to the lesion after SCI.

We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 μg 17β-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).","estrogen","pubmed"

In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance: age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male. By deepening our understanding of why a gender advantage exists, potential new therapeutics can be designed to improve recovery for the male population following the initial trauma or putatively augment the neuroprotective privilege in females for enhanced outcomes.","estrogen","pubmed"

The only treatment currently available is methylprednisolone, which is widely used and renders limited efficacy in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be developed. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 μg/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 μg was found to be as effective as 100 μg in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes. Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury.

The estrogen group was treated with intramuscular injection of 100 µg/kg estrogen every day till the death of animal models, while the simple injury group was treated with intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL saline every day. Then these animals were put to death in the 1st d, 3rd d, 5th d, 8th d, 14th d and 21st d after SCI respectively and tissue sections were prepared, followed by B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) detection, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and detection of the cell apoptosis in animal models after SCI. In the 14th d after the injury of spinal cord nervous system, Gale grading and inclined plate maintenance tests were carried out. In the 1st d after SCI, there was a higher expression of Bcl-2 protein in the SCI tissues. Bcl-2 protein reached the peak in the 3rd d after SCI in the simple injured group, while the estrogen group reached the peak in the 8th d. At that time, Bcl-2 protein was both expressed in nerve cells, and in glial cells in a higher level. The expression began to decline in the 14th d after SCI, and with only a little expression in the 21st d after SCI (p<0.05). TUNEL detection results showed that, positive cells dominated by glial cells emerged in simple injured group only 24th h later; they reached the peak after 3~8 days, and then began to reduce. In the 21st d, positive cells still existed, and there was less cell apoptosis after treated with estrogen (p<0.05). Two weeks after SCI, Gale score and inclined plate maintenance rate were higher in the estrogen group than in the simple injured group (p<0.01). Adverse effects that occurred in injury group included blood dryness, necrosis, cyst cavity and cavity, while in estrogen group, adverse effects included focal bleeding, hydropic degeneration of neuron, disappearance of partial nissl bodies and neuraxial edema. All these findings suggest that, estrogen used for treating SCI can effectively inhibit the apoptosis of early nerve cells and glial cells in injured spinal cord nervous system by improving the micro-circulation, enhancing the expression of Bcl-2 protein, removing the free radicals and inhibiting the antioxidation. Thus, it can reduce the secondary SCI and promote the recovery of injured spinal cord nervous functions.","estrogen","pubmed"

This scar contains reactive astrocytes, activated microglia, macrophages and other myeloid cells, meningeal cells, proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and a dense extracellular matrix. Whether the scar is beneficial or detrimental to recovery remains controversial. In the acute phase of recovery, scar-forming astrocytes limit the invasion of leukocytes and macrophages, but in the subacute and chronic phases of injury the glial scar is a physical and biochemical barrier to axonal regrowth. The signals that initiate the formation of the glial scar are unknown. Both canonical and noncanonical signaling Wnts are increased after spinal cord injury (SCI). Because Wnts are important regulators of OPC and oligodendrocyte development, we examined the role of canonical Wnt signaling in the glial reactions to CNS injury. In adult female mice carrying an OPC-specific conditionally deleted β-catenin gene, there is reduced proliferation of OPCs after SCI, reduced accumulation of activated microglia/macrophages, and reduced astrocyte hypertrophy. Using an infraorbital optic nerve crush injury, we show that reducing β-catenin-dependent signaling in OPCs creates an environment that is permissive to axonal regeneration. Viral-induced expression of Wnt3a in the normal adult mouse spinal cord induces an injury-like response in glia. Thus canonical Wnt signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce injury responses among glial cells. These data suggest that targeting Wnt expression after SCI may have therapeutic potential in promoting axon regeneration.","estrogen","pubmed"

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-α mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-α antagonist. We also observed that ER-α was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-α. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-α dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen׳s effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition.","estrogen","pubmed"

Immediate treatment with diarylpropionitrile (DPN), a non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor ß ligand, resulted in a significant increase in Nrf2 levels, and reduction of inflammation and apoptosis compared to untreated SCI animals.

In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females.

AQP4 increases in TMX-treated SCI rats were associated with smaller fluid-filled cavities with borders consisting of densely packed AQP4-expressing astrocytes that closely resemble the organization of normal glia limitans externa (in contrast to large cavities in control SCI rats that lacked glia limitans-like borders and contained reactive glial cells).

We show that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 is mainly distributed in the ventral horn and white matter of the spinal cord, which is totally different from nuclear estrogen receptors. We also show that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 is specifically expressed by neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells, but not astrocytes. Furthermore, estrogen treatment prevents spinal cord injury-induced apoptotic cell death and enhances functional recovery after spinal cord injury, which can be mimicked by the specific G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 agonist G-1 and inhibited by specific knockdown of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 expression, but not pure nuclear ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Finally, we show that estrogen or G-1 up-regulates the protein expression level of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 to intensify estrogenic effects during spinal cord injury. These results reveal that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 may mediate estrogenic neuroprotection against spinal cord injury, and underline the promising potential of estrogen with its new target G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 for the treatment of spinal cord injury patients.","estrogen","pubmed"

Attenuating the detrimental aspects of the inflammatory response is a promising strategy to potentially ameliorate the secondary injury, and promote significant functional recovery.

Therefore, therapeutic approaches to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death after SCI should be considered. Estrogens are well known to have a broad neuroprotective effect, but the protective effect of estrogens on oligodendrocytes after injury is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that 17β-estradiol attenuates apoptosis of oligodendrocytes by inhibiting RhoA and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation after SCI. Estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β were expressed in oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord, and 17β-estradiol treatment significantly inhibited oligodendrocyte cell death at 7 d after injury as compared with vehicle (cyclodextrin) control. 17β-Estradiol also attenuated caspase-3 and -9 activation at 7 d and reduced the loss of axons from progressive degeneration. In addition, 17β-estradiol inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were activated and peaked at 3 and/or 5 d after injury. Furthermore, administration of Rho inhibitor, PEP-1-C3 exoenzyme, inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, and decreased phosphorylated c-Jun level at 5 d after injury. Additionally, the attenuation of RhoA and JNK3 activation as well as oligodendrocyte cell death by 17β-estradiol was reversed by ER antagonist, ICI182780. Our results thus indicate that 17β-estradiol treatment improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing oligodendrocyte cell death via inhibition of RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were ER dependent. Furthermore, improvement of hindlimb motor function by posttreatment of 17β-estradiol suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI patients.","estrogen","pubmed"

Disability, including long-lasting motor and sensory dysfunction, typically results from damage to the descending and ascending spinal tracts and interneurons and, secondarily, to the neuronal degeneration that occurs proximal and distal to the spinal insult. Numerous strategies are being implemented to protect neurons from damage, to enhance axon growth and to foster cell proliferation. Described in this report are recent clinical trials aimed at testing strategies to restore locomotion after SCI. While laboratory animal studies have indicated that it may be possible to minimize neuronal damage resulting from spinal cord injury, little progress has been made in reducing or reversing the events associated with the chronic phase of this condition. The strategy aiming to inhibit single molecule sometimes shows controversial results. In SCI, a lot of players participate in motor and sensory dysfunctions. Therefore, sufficient functional recovery may be achieved by regulating multiple targets. Regrowth of tracts connecting the brain and spinal cord, and axonal sprouting of propriospinal interneurons are fundamentally important for neuronal network working. In addition, remyelination, protection of neuronal death, inhibition of inflammation, and upregulation of beneficial influence of astrocytes are also quite crucial to supporting the axonal refining. Combination of several strategies might be useful as a practical therapy. Several compounds such as a Sema3A inhibitor, estrogen, withanoside IV and their relating compounds or other neurotrophic factor-mimicking agents may be candidates for useful SCI therapeutic drugs since those have multi-effects on damaged spinal cord.

Since use of high dose estrogen may have detrimental side effects and therefore may never be used in the clinic, the current study investigated the efficacy of this steroid hormone at very low doses in SCI. In particular, we tested the impact of dosing (1-10 μg/kg), mode of delivery (intravenous vs. osmotic pump), and delay in estrogen application (15 min-4 h post-SCI) on microgliosis and neuronal death in acute SCI in rats. Treatment with 17β-estradiol (1-10 μg/kg) significantly reduced microglial activation and also attenuated apoptosis of neurons compared to untreated SCI animals. The attenuation of cell death and inflammation by estrogen was observed regardless of mode and time of delivery following injury.

Blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability, tissue edema formation, microglial activation, neuronal cell death and myelin loss were determined in rats subjected to spinal cord contusion. The results showed that tamoxifen, administered at 30 min post-injury, significantly decreased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production induced by microglial activation, alleviated the amount of Evans blue leakage and edema formation. In addition, tamoxifen treatment clearly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons post-SCI. The myelin loss and the increase in production of myelin-associated axonal growth inhibitors were also found to be significantly attenuated at day 3 post-injury. Furthermore, rats treated with tamoxifen scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI than did vehicle-treated rats, suggesting improved functional outcome after SCI.

To gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of E2, the following end points of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) expression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and COX-2; (4) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression); and (5) tissue TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels. In another set of experiments, the pretreatment or posttreatment with E2 significantly ameliorates the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of E2 were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of E2.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17beta-estradiol and reproductive aging on motor function, neuronal death, and white matter sparing after SCI of post- and pre-menopausal rats. Two-month-old or 1- year-old female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with a silastic capsule containing 180 microg/mL of 17beta-estradiol or vehicle. Complete crush SCI at T8-9 was performed 1 week later. Additional animals of each age group were left ovary-intact but were spinal cord injured. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor test was performed. Spinal cords were collected on post-SCI days 1, 7, and 21, and processed for histological markers. Administration of 17beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats improved recovery of hind-limb locomotion, increased white matter sparing, and decreased apoptosis in both the post- and pre-menopausal rats. Also, ovary-intact 1-year-old rats did worse than ovary-intact 2-month-old rats, suggesting that endogenous estrogen confers neuroprotection in young rats, which is lost in older animals. Taken together, these data suggest that estrogen is neuroprotective in SCI and that the loss of endogenous estrogen-mediated neuroprotective seen in older rats can be attenuated with exogenous administration of 17beta-estradiol.","estrogen","pubmed"

Rats received a moderate, weight-drop contusion injury to spinal cord were administered orally with BF at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 14 d and functional recovery was measured by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor open field behavioral rating test, inclined plane test and foot print analysis. To examine the neuroprotective effect of BF, TUNEL staining and counting were also performed. In addition, the expression and/or activation of MMP-2, MMP-9 and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were examined by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography using spinal cord tissue from 1 d after injury. Our data showed that BF significantly inhibited the expression and activation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 after SCI. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were also significantly attenuated by BF. Furthermore, BF reduced apoptotic cell death at 1 d after injury, thereby significantly reduced lesion volume and improved functional recovery. Taken together, these results suggest that BF can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for treating acute spinal injury.","ethanol","pubmed"

Daily administration of EECP after the spinal cord injury ameliorated the locomotor function, which effect was accompanied by a reduced lesion size. Furthermore, the EECP suppressed iNOS gene expression, thus reducing NO generation, and also increased the expression level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 mRNAs in the lesion site, suggesting that the EECP reduced the inflammatory and apoptotic circumstances through attenuation of iNOS mRNA expression and facilitation of mRNA expression of neurotrophins in the injured spinal cord. These results suggest that Chinese propolis may become a promising tool for wide use in the nervous system for reducing the secondary neuronal damage following primary physical injury.","ethanol","pubmed"

In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of total ethanol extract of Scutellaria baicalensis (EESB), after SCI. Using primary microglial cultures, EESB treatment significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of such inflammatory mediators as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production were significantly attenuated by EESB treatment. For in vivo study, rats that had received a moderate spinal cord contusion injury at T9 received EESB orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg. EESB inhibited expression of proinflammatory factors and protein carbonylation and nitration after SCI. EESB also inhibited microglial activation at 4 h after injury. Furthermore, EESB significantly inhibited apoptotic cell death of neurons and oligodendrocytes and improved functional recovery after SCI. Lesion cavity and myelin loss were also reduced following EESB treatment. Thus, our data suggest that EESB significantly improve functional recovery by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress after injury.","ethanol","pubmed"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Methylprednisolone (MP), by reducing edema and protecting the cell membrane against peroxidation, is the only pharmacological agent with a proven clinically beneficial effect on SCI. Melatonin, known as a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have an effect on lipid peroxidation following experimental SCI. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of MP and melatonin on neurological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological recovery. Female albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into five groups of 18 rats each and six rats for the control group. Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of MP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","ethanol","pubmed"

In this study alcoholic intoxication neither caused depressed motor responsiveness in head-injured patients with high serum ethanol levels nor accounted for the motor examination in those exhibiting the flaccid state. Flaccidity was attributed principally to impaired ventilation in 4 patients, a major intracranial mass in 12, and a spinal cord injury in 1. Compared to the larger group of head-injured patients, the flaccid patients had a significantly greater incidence of hypercapnia (P less than 0.001), acidosis (P less than 0.01), and both elevated and uncontrollable intracranial pressure (ICP) (P less than 0.001). These findings and the high mortality rate (76%) in this study suggest that the magnitude of respiratory complications and the severity of mechanical brain injury are greater in flaccid patients. The flaccid patients undergoing surgical decompression for major intracranial mass lesions (11 cases) have all died and, although still small in number, this group may represent an important subset with a poor prognosis. Nonetheless, a protocol that encourages rapid radiological and electrophysiological assessment and vigorous surgical and ICP management until the probable cause of flaccidity is identified and treated has benefit. The flaccid state was reversed and a good recovery was attained after the restoration of blood pressure and/or ventilation in 2 patients who appeared to have sustained a very grave head injury. In another patient, absent somatosensory evoked potentials greatly facilitated the diagnosis of a spinal subdural hematoma. This program of prompt diagnosis and intense therapy did not result in a protracted course or undue numbers of severely brain-damaged survivors.","ethanol","pubmed"

Since many studies have shown improved outcome from spinal cord injury (SCI) by anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents, we tested the efficacy of oral gemfibrozil given before or after SCI for promoting tissue preservation and behavioral recovery after spinal contusion injury in mice. Unfortunately, the results were contrary to our hypothesis; in our first attempt, gemfibrozil treatment exacerbated locomotor deficits and increased tissue pathology after SCI. In subsequent experiments, the behavioral effects were not replicated but histological outcomes again were worse. We also tested the efficacy of a different PPAR-α agonist, fenofibrate, which also modulates immune responses and is beneficial in several neurodegenerative disease models. Fenofibrate treatment did not improve recovery, although there was a slight trend for a modest increase in histological tissue sparing. Based on our results, we conclude that PPAR-α agonists yield either no effect or worsen recovery from spinal cord injury, at least at the doses and the time points of drug delivery tested here.

Arterial blood pressure was overall well maintained except for a very transient hypotension at surgical incision. Blood loss was moderate and did not require transfusion. Soon after recovery, the patient complained of paresthesia in both legs and neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb hypoesthesia, compatible with an incomplete medullar syndrome at the level of T12-L1. On postoperative day one, a plain magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated a hyperintense signal in the spinal cord from T8 to T9 on T2-weighted images consistent with ischemia of the spinal cord whereas the heterogeneous aspect of the spinal cord was due to an unusually high fat content of the epidural space. Neurological signs improved progressively and one week later the patient had recovered normal sensory functions of both lower limbs. Although arterial ischemia is the most common cause of postoperative spinal cord injury, other mechanisms may be invoked. We raise the possibility that a combination of intraoperative risk factors (hypotension, excessive postural changes) with anatomic predispositions (increased epidural venous pressure or fat content, previous bone disease) can produce arterial and/or venous ischemia of the spinal cord.","fenofibrate","pubmed"

Herein, we compare the effects of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on forelimb motor function recovery after a C4 bilateral dorsal funiculi crush in adult female rats. After injury, single pellet reaching performance and forelimb muscle activity decreased in all rats. From 1 to 6 weeks after injury, rats were tested on these tasks with and without buspirone (1-2 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (1-5 mg/kg). Reaching and grasping success rates of buspirone-treated rats improved rapidly within 2 weeks after injury and plateaued over the next 4 weeks of testing. Electromyography (EMG) from selected muscles in the dominant forelimb showed that buspirone-treated animals used new reaching strategies to achieve success after the injury. However, forelimb performance dramatically decreased within 2 weeks of buspirone withdrawal. In contrast, fluoxetine treatment resulted in a more progressive rate of improvement in forelimb performance over 8 weeks after injury. Neither buspirone nor fluoxetine significantly improved quadrupedal locomotion on the horizontal ladder test. The improved accuracy of reaching and grasping, patterns of muscle activity, and increased excitability of spinal motor-evoked potentials after buspirone administration reflect extensive reorganization of connectivity within and between supraspinal and spinal sensory-motor netxcopy works. Thus, both serotonergic drugs, buspirone and fluoxetine, neuromodulated these networks to physiological states that enabled markedly improved forelimb function after cervical spinal cord injury.","fluoxetine","pubmed"

While medications and physical rehabilitation are prescribed to alleviate spastic symptoms, the insufficiency of their effects remains an important problem to be addressed. Given the challenges associated with increasing the dose of medication, we hypothesized that a combination therapy with medication and physical rehabilitation can be effective. Therefore, we examined the effects of treadmill training (TMT) along with serotonergic medication using a spastic rat model after contusive injury. Spasticity-strong SCI rats were selected 4 weeks after SCI and received one of the following interventions for 2 weeks: only TMT, TMT with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), TMT with cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist), only fluoxetine, or only cyproheptadine. We performed the swimming test to quantify the frequency of spastic behaviors. We also evaluated hindlimb locomotor functions every week. At the end of the intervention, we examined the Hoffman reflex from the plantar muscle and the immunoreactivity of the 5-HT2A receptor in spinal cord tissues. While the TMT group and cyproheptadine-treated groups showed decreased spastic behaviors and reduction in spinal hyperreflexia, the fluoxetine-treated group showed the opposite effect, even with TMT. Moreover, TMT suppressed the expression of the 5-HT2A receptor in the lumbar spinal motor neurons, while cyproheptadine treatment did not change it. We did not observe any differences in locomotor functions between the groups. Taken together, our findings indicate that TMT and cyproheptadine significantly alleviated spastic symptoms, but did not show synergistic or additive effects.","fluoxetine","pubmed"

Previous work has described adaptations in spinal systems that might underlie this hyperexcitability, including an increase in constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors in spinal motoneurons. That work, however, examined adaptations following complete transection SCI, whereas SCI in humans is usually anatomically and functionally incomplete. We therefore evaluated whether constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors contributes to reflex hyperexcitability in an incomplete compression model of SCI and to spasms in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm that 5-HT2C receptor constitutive activity contributes to reflex excitability after incomplete SCI. We also evaluated whether constitutive activity could be altered by manipulation of neural activity levels after SCI, testing the hypothesis that it reflects homeostatic processes acting to maintain spinal excitability. We decreased neural activity after SCI by administering baclofen and increased activity by administering the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. We found that drug administration produced minimal alterations in in vivo locomotor function or reflex excitability. Similarly, we found that neither baclofen nor fluoxetine altered the contribution of constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors to reflexes after SCI, although the contribution of 5-HT2C receptors to reflex activity was altered after SSRIs. These results confirm the importance of constitutive activity in 5-HT2C receptors to spinal hyperexcitability following SCI in the clinically relevant case of incomplete SCI but suggest that this activity is not driven by homeostatic processes that act to maintain overall levels of spinal excitability.NEW & NOTEWORTHY After spinal cord injury (SCI), most people will develop muscle spasms below their level of injury that can severely impact function. In this work, we examine the adaptations that occur within the spinal cord after SCI that contribute to these motor dysfunctions. We also evaluate one hypothesis about how these adaptations develop, which will potentially lead to intervention strategies to improve functional outcomes in persons with SCI.","fluoxetine","pubmed"

It has been demonstrated that activation of the serotonin system can promote locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. The present study was designed to investigate whether serotonergic activation can improve respiratory function during the chronic injury state. Bilateral diaphragm electromyogram and tidal volume were measured in anesthetized and spontaneously breathing adult rats at 8 wk post-C2Hx or C2 laminectomy. A bolus intravenous injection of a serotonin precursor [5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 10 mg/kg], a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine, 10 mg/kg), or a potent agonist for serotonin 2A receptors (TCB-2, 0.05 mg/kg) was used to activate the serotonergic system. Present results demonstrated that 5-HTP and TCB-2, but not fluoxetine, significantly increased the inspiratory activity of the diaphragm electromyogram ipsilateral to the lesion for at least 30 min in C2Hx animals, but not in animals that received sham surgery. However, the tidal volume was not increased after administration of 5-HTP or TCB-2, indicating that the enhancement of ipsilateral diaphragm activity is not associated with improvement of the tidal volume. These results suggest that exogenous activation of the serotonergic system can specifically enhance the ipsilateral diaphragmatic motor outputs, but this approach may not be sufficient to improve respiratory functional recovery following chronic cervical spinal injury.","fluoxetine","pubmed"

Recent evidence indicates that fluoxetine, an anti-depressant drug, is shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischaemic brain injury, but the precise mechanism underlying its protective effects is largely unknown. Here, we show that fluoxetine prevented blood-spinal cord barrier disruption via inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activation after spinal cord injury. After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with an infinite horizon impactor in the mouse, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and further administered once a day for indicated time points. Fluoxetine treatment significantly inhibited messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, 9 and 12 after spinal cord injury. By zymography and fluorimetric enzyme activity assay, fluoxetine also significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease 2 and matrix metalloprotease 9 activities after injury. In addition, fluoxetine inhibited nuclear factor kappa B-dependent matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in bEnd.3, a brain endothelial cell line, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Fluoxetine also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as zona occludens 1 and occludin after injury in vivo as well as in bEnd.3 cultures. By immunofluorescence staining, fluoxetine prevented the breakdown of the tight junction integrity in endothelial cells of blood vessel after injury. Furthermore, fluoxetine inhibited the messenger RNA expression of chemokines such as Groα, MIP1α and 1β, and prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators after injury. Finally, fluoxetine attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved locomotor function after injury. Thus, our results indicate that fluoxetine improved functional recovery in part by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease activation and preventing blood-spinal cord barrier disruption after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our study suggests that fluoxetine may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity following ischaemic brain injury and spinal cord injury in humans.","fluoxetine","pubmed"

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) is largely responsible for the early disruption of the blood spinal cord barrier. This system initiates macrophage infiltration and degradation of myelin, which plays a pivotal role in how NP occurs. In a recent study, we demonstrated that folic acid (FA) treatment to cSCI rats reduced NP and improved functional recovery by repressing MMP-2 expression. We hypothesize that MMP-2 expression is suppressed because FA actively methylates the DNA sequence that encodes for the MMP-2 protein. However, modulation of MMP-2 expression for alleviation of NP is only pertinent to the mid- to late-phase of injury. Therefore, we need to explore alternate therapeutic methods to target the early- to mid-phase of injury to wholly alleviate NP. Furthering our previous findings on inhibiting MMP-2 expression by FA in mid- and late- phase following cSCI in rats, we hypothesized that FA will methylate and suppress MMP-9 expression during the early- phase, day 1, 3, 7 post cSCI and mid- phase (day 18 post cSCI), in comparison with MMP-2 expression during mid- and the late-phase of cSCI. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250-270g) underwent cSCI, using a NYU impactor, with 12.5 gm/cm injury. The spinal cord-injured animals were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a standardized dose of FA (80 μg/kg body weight) on day 1, 2, 3, prior to cSCI, followed by daily injection up to 14 or 17 days post-cSCI in different experiments. Animals were euthanized on day 1, 3, 7 post cSCI (early- phase), day 18 post cSCI (mid- phase), and day 42 post cSCI (late-phase) and the epicenter region of injured spinal cord were harvested for MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression analysis by Western blots technique. i) During early-phase on day 1, 3, and 7, the quantitation displayed no statistical significance in MMP-9 expression, between water- and FA- injected rats. ii) On day 18 post-cSCI, FA significantly modulates the expression of MMP-9 (p = 0.043) iii) Comparing results with MMP-2 expression and inhibition, FA significantly modulates the expression of MMP-2 on day 18 post cSCI (FA- and water-injected rats (p = 0.003). iv) In addition, FA significantly modulates the expression of MMP-2 on day 42 post-cSCI comparing FA- and water- injected rat groups (p = 0.034). We report that FA administration results in alleviating cSCI-induced NP by inhibiting MMP-9 in the proposed mid- phase of cSCI. However, FA administration resulted in MMP-2 decline during both mid- through late- phase following cSCI. Our study elucidates a new phase of cSCI, the mid-phase. We conclude that further investigation on discovering and quantifying the nature of the mid- phase of SCI injury is needed.","folic_acid","pubmed"

Of 3,453 candidate papers, 145 met study criteria and were included in this review. Risk factors were reported for group 1: non-specific low back pain (smoking, overweight/obesity, negative recovery expectations), non-specific neck pain (high job demands, monotonous work); group 2: degenerative spinal disease (workers' compensation claim, degenerative scoliosis), and group 3: spinal tuberculosis (age, imprisonment, previous history of tuberculosis), spinal cord injury (age, accidental injury), vertebral fracture from osteoporosis (type 1 diabetes, certain medications, smoking), and neural tube defects (folic acid deficit, anti-convulsant medications, chlorine, influenza, maternal obesity). A range of comorbidities was identified for spinal disorders. Many associated factors for common spinal disorders identified in this study are modifiable. The most common spinal disorders are co-morbid with general health conditions, but there is a lack of clarity in the literature differentiating which conditions are merely comorbid versus ones that are risk factors. Modifiable risk factors present opportunities for policy, research, and public health prevention efforts on both the individual patient and community levels. Further research into prevention interventions for spinal disorders is needed to address this gap in the literature.","folic_acid","pubmed"

Recent studies have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP2 play a critical role in inducing NP following SCI. Promoter methylation of MMPs is known to suppress their transcription and reduce NP. In this context, it has been shown in rodents that folic acid (FA), an FDA approved dietary supplement and key methyl donor in the central nervous system (CNS), increases axonal regeneration and repair of injured CNS in part via methylation. Based on above observations, in this study, we test whether FA could decrease MMP2 expression and thereby decrease SCI-induced NP. Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250-270 g received contusion spinal cord injuries (cSCIs) with a custom spinal cord impactor device that drops a 10 g weight from a height of 12.5 mm. The injured rats received either i.p. injections of FA (80 µg/kg) or water (control) 3 days prior and 17 days post-cSCI (mid phase) or for 3 days pre-cSCI and 14 days post-cSCI ending on the 42nd day of cSCI (late phase). The functional neurological deficits due to cSCI were then assessed by Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores either on post-impaction days 0 through 18 post-cSCI (mid phase) or on days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 (late phase). Baseline measurements were taken the day before starting treatments. Thermal hyperalgesia (TH) testing for pain was performed on 4 days pre-cSCI (baseline data) and on days 18, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post-cSCI. Following TH testing, animals were euthanized and spinal cords harvested for MMP-2 expression analysis. The FA-treated groups showed higher BBB scores during mid phase (day 18) and in late phase (day 42) of injury compared to controls, suggesting enhanced functional recovery. There is a transient decline in TH in animals from the FA-treated group compared to controls when tested on days 18, 21, 28, and 35, indicative of a decrease in NP. However, when tested 25 days after stopping FA administration on day 42 of cSCI, no significant difference in TH was observed between FA-treated and control animals. Western blot analysis of the injured spinal cord from FA-treated animals showed significant decline in MMP2 expression compared to spinal cord samples from water-treated controls. Together, these data suggest that FA could alleviate NP and improve functional recovery post-SCI, possibly by reducing the expression of MMP2. Further studies will open up a novel and easy natural therapy, ideal for clinical translation with minimal side effects, for managing SCI-induced NP. Such studies might also throw light on a possible epigenetic mechanism in FA-induced recovery after SCI.","folic_acid","pubmed"

Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is an irreversible inhibitor of MPO. Recently, we demonstrated, in a model of brain ischemia/reperfusion, that dapsone has antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. The effects of dapsone on MPO activity, lipid peroxidation (LP) processes, motor function recovery, and the amount of spared tissue were evaluated in a rat model of SCI. MPO activity had increased 24.5-fold 24 hr after SCI vs. the sham group, and it had diminished by 38% and 19% in the groups treated with dapsone at 3 and 5 hr after SCI, respectively. SCI increased LP by 45%, and this increase was blocked by dapsone. In rats treated with dapsone, a significant motor function recovery (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score, BBB) was observed beginning during the first week of evaluation and continuing until the end of the study. Spontaneous recovery 8 weeks after SCI was 9.2 ± 1.12, whereas, in the dapsone-treated groups, it reached 13.6 ± 1.04 and 12.9 ± 1.17. Spared tissue increased by 42% and 33% in the dapsone-treated groups (3 and 5 hr after SCI, respectively) vs. SCI without treatment. Dapsone significantly prevented mortality. The results show that inhibition of MPO by dapsone significantly protected the spinal cord from tissue damage and enhanced motor recovery after SCI.","folic_acid","pubmed"

Two groups were intubated, anesthetized and had moderate brain injury induced by rapid axial head rotation without impact. One group of injured (Inj) animals received folic acid (Fol; 80 μg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 15 min following injury, and then daily for 6 days (Inj + Fol; n = 7). The second group of injured animals received an IP injection of saline (Sal) at the same time points (Inj + Sal; n = 8). Two uninjured (Uninj) control groups (Uninj + Fol, n = 8; Uninj + Sal, n = 7) were intubated, anesthetized and received folic acid (80 μg/kg) or saline by IP injection at the same time points as the injured animals following a sham procedure. Animals underwent neurobehavioral and cognitive testing on days 1 and 4 following injury to assess behavior, memory, learning and problem solving. Serum folic acid and homocysteine levels were collected prior to injury and again before euthanasia. The piglets were euthanized 6 days following injury, and their brains were perfusion fixed for histological analysis. Folic acid levels were significantly higher in both Fol groups on day 6. Homocysteine levels were not affected by treatment. On day 1 following injury, the Inj + Fol group showed significantly more exploratory interest, and better motor function, learning and problem solving compared to the Inj + Sal group. Inj + Fol animals had a significantly lower cognitive composite dysfunction score compared to all other groups on day 1. These functional improvements were not seen on day 4 following injury. Axonal injury measured by β-amyloid precursor protein staining 6 days after injury was not affected by treatment. These results suggest that folic acid may enhance early functional recovery in this piglet model of pediatric head injury. This is the first study to describe the application of complex functional testing to assess an intervention outcome in a swine model of TBI.","folic_acid","pubmed"

Numerous classes of drugs, already in use in the acute phase of spinal cord injury, are intriguing because they (1) readily cross the blood-spinal cord barrier to modulate activity in the central nervous system and (2) are administered during a window of time in which neuroprotection, and even some repair, are feasible.

In contrast, α2δ2 pharmacological blockade through gabapentin administration promoted corticospinal structural plasticity and regeneration in adulthood. Using an optogenetic strategy combined with in vivo electrophysiological recording, we demonstrated that regenerating corticospinal axons functionally integrate into spinal circuits.

Only few data of RLS in a context of spinal cord injury have been reported. We report the case of a woman with secondary RLS due to hemorrhage of a spinal cord cavernoma located at T9-T10.

Relief of symptom's severity was obtained with gabapentin 600mg in the evening. We hypothesize a possible involvement of the diencephalospinal pathway in the patient's RLS pathophysiology. A systematic study of focal lesions associated with RLS may contribute to improving our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this condition.

To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 ± 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes. Early intervention with anticonvulsants may have effects beyond pain management and warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in human SCI.","gabapentin","pubmed"

SCI-induced neuropathic pain can be manifested as both tactile allodynia (a painful sensation to a non-noxious stimulus) and hyperalgesia (an enhanced sensation to a painful stimulus). The mechanisms underlying these pain states are poorly understood. Clinical studies have shown that gabapentin, a drug that binds to the voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-2-delta-1 subunit (Ca(v)α2δ-1) proteins is effective in the management of SCI-induced neuropathic pain. Accordingly, we hypothesized that tactile allodynia post SCI is mediated by an upregulation of Ca(v)α2δ-1 in dorsal spinal cord. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether SCI-induced dysregulation of spinal Ca(v)α2δ-1 plays a contributory role in below-level allodynia development in a rat spinal T9 contusion injury model. We found that Ca(v)α2δ-1 expression levels were significantly increased in L4-6 dorsal, but not ventral, spinal cord of SCI rats that correlated with tactile allodynia development in the hind paw plantar surface. Furthermore, both intrathecal gabapentin treatment and blocking SCI-induced Ca(v)α2δ-1 protein upregulation by intrathecal Ca(v)α2δ-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides could reverse tactile allodynia in SCI rats. These findings support that SCI-induced Ca(v)α2δ-1 upregulation in spinal dorsal horn is a key component in mediating below-level neuropathic pain states, and selectively targeting this pathway may provide effective pain relief for SCI patients. Spinal cord contusion injury caused increased calcium channel Ca(v)α2δ-1 subunit expression in dorsal spinal cord that contributes to neuropathic pain states.","gabapentin","pubmed"

Recovery of locomotor function was assessed with an open field test and scored using the open field test scale (BBB scale). Somatosensory tests of paw withdrawal responses accompanied by supraspinal responses to both mechanical punctate (von Frey hairs) and nonpunctate (4 mm diameter blunt probe) as well as thermal (radiant heat) peripheral stimuli were performed. Comparisons at the level of the individual animal between precontusion and postcontusion responses indicated significant increases in reactions to low threshold punctate mechanical stimuli, non-punctate stimuli and thermal stimuli (p < 0.05). To demonstrate the validity of this model as a central pain model, gabapentin, an agent used clinically for central pain, was given i.p. at 10 or 30 mg/kg. Gabapentin treatment significantly and reversibly changed the responses, consistent with the attenuation of the abnormal sensory behavior, and the attenuated responses lasted for the duration of the drug effect (up to 6 h).

Considering the promising effects of melatonin (MEL) against destructive mechanisms in other models of brain damage, in the current study we evaluated its ameliorative effects on sensory-motor outcomes, inflammatory mediators, histological changes and other post-SCI complications. Rats, in SCI and MEL groups, underwent laminectomy followed by a severe compression injury by an aneurysm clip. Then, intrathecal treatment with vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or MEL was carried out post-injury. Acetone drop, von Frey, inclined plane, and BBB tests as well as weight changes and auricle temperature, were used to evaluate the neuropathic pain, motor function, and other post-SCI complications. The effects of MEL on the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed using gelatin zymography method every week till day 28 post-SCI. Histopathological assessments were performed on days 14, 21, and 28. MEL treatment resulted in decreased motor dysfunction, mechanical and cold allodynia, auricle temperature, and also ameliorated weight loss. Moreover, MEL suppressed MMP-9 activity while increasing that of MMP-2 post-SCI indicating its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Also, MEL significantly preserved white matter myelinated areas and the number of sensory neurons post-SCI. The results suggest MEL as a promising candidate for medical therapies with advantageous effects on improving functional recovery through suppressing inflammatory mediators, and attenuating spinal tissue damages.","gelatin","pubmed"

Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate or differentiate into other specific cell types. These cells represent potential treatments for SCIs. However, recent studies have shown that NSCs mainly differentiate into astrocytes, rather than neurons, in the microenvironment of an SCI. BMSCs have been reported to promote neuronal differentiation of NSCs and reduce the formation of astrocytes. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) provides superior mechanical properties and functional characteristics for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In this study, we proposed a functional scaffold developed by loading BMSCs and NSCs into 3D GelMA hydrogel. BMSCs and NSCs that were photo-encapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and demonstrated good proliferation in vitro. The NSCs differentiated more toward neurons and oligodendrocytes than toward astrocytes, a phenomenon more noticeable in low-modulus hydrogels. When functional hydrogel scaffolds, loaded with BMSCs and NSCs, were implanted into the hemisection site of the rat spinal cord, they could significantly promote motor function recovery and neuronal differentiation, and decrease glial scarring, fibrotic scarring, and inflammatory responses. The immense therapeutic potential of this system to promote axonal regeneration was thereby demonstrated. Taken together, loading of the GelMA scaffold with BMSCs and NSCs is a promising therapeutic strategy to trigger functional regeneration of the spinal cord.","gelatin","pubmed"

Here, we develop an injectable composite hydrogel system for use as a minimally invasive treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) using motor neurons (MNs) derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The composite hydrogel is based on a modified gelatin matrix integrated with shape-memory polymer fibers. The gelatin matrix creates a local microenvironment for cell assembly and also acts as a lubricant during injection through a fine catheter. Notably, shape-memory fiber scaffolds are able to recover to maintain the microstructures even after dramatic deformation from injection operation, providing the necessary support and guidance for motor neuron differentiation. We find that the composite hydrogel with an aligned fiber scaffold greatly improves the viability of ESCs and their differentiation toward MNs both in vitro and in vivo. When transplanted to SCI animals by injection, the ESC-loaded composite hydrogels are identified to significantly enhance tissue regeneration and motor function recovery in mice. With this proof-of-concept study, we believe that the injectable composite hydrogel system provides a promising solution for in vivo cell delivery with minimum invasiveness and can be readily extended to other stem-cell-based regenerative treatments.","gelatin","pubmed"

It remained to be explored whether such a strategy was effective for repairing the large spinal cord tissue loss as well as restoring motor function in larger animals. We have therefore extended in this study to construct a canine MSC-derived neural network tissue in vitro with the aim to evaluate its efficacy in treating adult beagle dog subjected to a complete transection of the spinal cord. The results showed that after co-culturing with neurotropin-3 overexpressing Schwann cells in a gelatin sponge scaffold for 14 days, TrkC overexpressing MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells. In the latter, some cells appeared to make contacts with each other through synapse-like structures with trans-synaptic electrical activities. Remarkably, the SCI canines receiving the transplantation of the MSC-derived neural network tissue demonstrated a gradual restoration of paralyzed limb motor function, along with improved electrophysiological presentation when compared with the control group. Magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging showed that the canines receiving the MSC-derived neural network tissue exhibited robust nerve tract regeneration in the injury/graft site. Histological analysis showed that some of the MSC-derived neuron-like cells had survived in the injury/graft site up to 6.5 months. Implantation of MSC-derived neural network tissue significantly improved the microenvironment of the injury/graft site. It is noteworthy that a variable number of them had integrated with the regenerating corticospinal tract nerve fibers and 5-HT nerve fibers through formation of synapse-like contacts. The results suggest that the transplanted MSC-derived neural network tissue may serve as a structural and functional ""neuronal relay"" to restore the paralyzed limb motor function in the canine with complete SCI.","gelatin","pubmed"

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) without supply constraints and ethical concerns have emerged as a viable treatment option for repairing neurological disorders. However, the primarily limitations in the neuroregeneration field are uncontrolled cell differentiation, and low cell viability caused by the ischemic environment. The mechanical property of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel can be easily controlled and shared similar characteristics with nerve tissue, thus promoting cell survival and controlled cell differentiation. We propose the combination of a 3D gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with iPSC-derived NSCs (iNSCs) to promote regeneration after SCI. In vitro, the iNSCs photoencapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and differentiated well, especially in lower-moduli hydrogels. More robust neurite outgrowth and more neuronal differentiation were detected in the soft hydrogel group. To further evaluate the in vivo neuronal regeneration effect of the GelMA hydrogels, a mouse spinal cord transection model was generated. We found that GelMA/iNSC implants significantly promoted functional recovery. Further histological analysis showed that the cavity areas were significantly reduced, and less collagen was deposited in the GelMA/iNSC group. Furthermore, the GelMA and iNSC combined transplantation decreased inflammation by reducing activated macrophages/microglia (CD68-positive cells). Additionally, GelMA/iNSC implantation showed striking therapeutic effects of inhibiting GFAP-positive cells and glial scar formation while simultaneously promoting axonal regeneration. Undoubtedly, use of this 3D hydrogel stem cell-loaded system is a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI repair.","gelatin","pubmed"

In this study, we evaluated the neurorestorative effects of an engineered HGF with a collagen biding domain (CBD-HGF). CBD-HGF remained in the spinal cord for 7 days after a single administration, while unmodified HGF was barely seen at 1 day. When a gelatin-furfurylamine (FA) hydrogel was applied on damaged spinal cord as a scaffold, CBD-HGF was retained in gelatin-FA hydrogel for 7 days, whereas HGF had faded by 1 day. A single administration of CBD-HGF enhanced recovery from spinal cord compression injury compared with HGF, as determined by motor recovery, and electrophysiological and immunohistochemical analyses. CBD-HGF alone failed to improve recovery from a complete transection injury, however CBD-HGF combined with gelatin-FA hydrogel promoted endogenous repair and recovery more effectively than HGF with hydrogel. These results suggest that engineered CBD-HGF has superior therapeutic effects than naïve HGF.

Although a scaffold is sometimes used for retaining transplanted cells in damaged tissue, it is also known to induce redundant immunoreactions during the degradation processes. In this study, the authors prepared cell sheets made of BMSCs, which are transplantable without a scaffold, and investigated their effects on axonal regeneration, glial scar formation, and functional recovery in a completely transected SCI model in rats. METHODS BMSC sheets were prepared from the bone marrow of female Fischer 344 rats using ascorbic acid and were cryopreserved until the day of transplantation. A gelatin sponge (GS), as a control, or BMSC sheet was transplanted into a 2-mm-sized defect of the spinal cord at the T-8 level. Axonal regeneration and glial scar formation were assessed 2 and 8 weeks after transplantation by immunohistochemical analyses using anti-Tuj1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies, respectively. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. RESULTS The BMSC sheets promoted axonal regeneration at 2 weeks after transplantation, but there was no significant difference in the number of Tuj1-positive axons between the sheet- and GS-transplanted groups. At 8 weeks after transplantation, Tuj1-positive axons elongated across the sheet, and their numbers were significantly greater in the sheet group than in the GS group. The areas of GFAP-positive glial scars in the sheet group were significantly reduced compared with those of the GS group at both time points. Finally, hindlimb locomotor function was ameliorated in the sheet group at 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study indicate that an ascorbic acid-induced BMSC sheet is effective in the treatment of SCI and enables autologous transplantation without requiring a scaffold.","gelatin","pubmed"

Previous work has demonstrated that recovery in the presence of spared axons after an incomplete lesion increases behavioral output after a subsequent complete spinal cord transection (TX). This suggests that spared axons direct adaptive changes in below-level neuronal networks of the lumbar cord. In response to spared fibers, we postulate that lumbar neuron networks support behavioral gains by preventing aberrant plasticity. As such, the present study measured histological and functional changes in the isolated lumbar cord after complete TX or incomplete contusion (SCI). To measure functional plasticity in the lumbar cord, we used an established instrumental learning paradigm (ILP). In this paradigm, neural circuits within isolated lumbar segments demonstrate learning by an increase in flexion duration that reduces exposure to a noxious leg shock. We employed this model using a proof-of-principle design to evaluate the role of sparing on lumbar learning and plasticity early (7 days) or late (42 days) after midthoracic SCI in a rodent model. Early after SCI or TX at 7 days, spinal learning was unattainable regardless of whether the animal recovered with or without axonal substrate. Failed learning occurred alongside measures of cell soma atrophy and aberrant dendritic spine expression within interneuron populations responsible for sensorimotor integration and learning. Alternatively, exposure of the lumbar cord to a small amount of spared axons for 6 weeks produced near-normal learning late after SCI. This coincided with greater cell soma volume and fewer aberrant dendritic spines on interneurons. Thus, an opportunity to influence activity-based learning in locomotor networks depends on spared axons limiting maladaptive plasticity. Together, this work identifies a time dependent interaction between spared axonal systems and adaptive plasticity in locomotor networks and highlights a critical window for activity-based rehabilitation.","gelatin","pubmed"

Anisotropic alginate-based capillary hydrogels (ACH) support peripheral nervous system derived axon growth, which is accompanied by glial supporting cell migration into the ACH. The aim of the present study was to analyze central nervous system (CNS) derived (entorhinal cortex, spinal cord slice cultures) axon regrowth into ACH containing linearly aligned capillaries of defined capillary sizes without and with gelatin constituent. Anisotropic ACH were prepared by ionotropic gel formation using Ba(2+), Cu(2+), Sr(2+), or Zn(2+) ions resulting in gels with average capillary diameters of 11, 13, 29, and 89μm, respectively. Postnatal rat entorhinal cortex or spinal cord slice cultures were placed on top of 500μm thick ACH. Seven days later axon growth and astroglial migration into the ACH were determined. Axon density within capillaries correlated positively with increasing capillary diameters, whereas longitudinally oriented axon outgrowth diminished with increasing capillary diameter. Axons growing into the hydrogels were always accompanied by astrocytes strongly suggesting that respective cells are required to mediate CNS axon elongation into ACH. Overall, midsize capillary diameter ACH appeared to be the best compromise between axon density and orientation. Taken together, ACH promote CNS axon ingrowth, which is determined by the capillary diameter and migration of slice culture derived astroglia into the hydrogel. Biomaterials are investigated as therapeutic tools to bridge irreversible lesions following traumatic spinal cord injury. The goal is to develop biomaterials, which promote longitudinally oriented regeneration of as many injured axons as possible as prerequisite for substantial functional recovery. Optimal parameters of the biomaterial have yet to be defined. In the present study we show that increasing capillary diameters within such hydrogels enhanced central nervous system axon regeneration at the expense of longitudinal orientation. Axon ingrowth into the hydrogels was only observed in the presence of glial supporting cells, namely astrocytes. This suggests that alginate-based hydrogels need to be colonized with respective cells in order to facilitate axon ingrowth.","gelatin","pubmed"

The ER stress-induced apoptosis response proteins CHOP, GRP78 and caspase-12 inhibited by NGF-GNL treatment were more obvious.

So far, there is still no effective treatment for spinal cord injury. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used to repair injured spinal cord as an effective strategy. However, the low neural differentiation frequency of MSCs has limited its application. The present study attempted to explore whether the grafted MSC-derived neural-like cells in a gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold could maintain neural features or transdifferentiate into myelin-forming cells in the transected spinal cord. We constructed an engineered tissue by co-seeding of MSCs with genetically enhanced expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) separately into a three-dimensional GS scaffold to promote the MSCs differentiating into neural-like cells and transplanted it into the gap of a completely transected rat spinal cord. The rats received extensive post-operation care, including cyclosporin A administrated once daily for 2 months. MSCs modified genetically could differentiate into neural-like cells in the MN + MT (NT-3-MSCs + TrKC-MSCs) group 14 days after culture in the GS scaffold. However, after the MSC-derived neural-like cells were transplanted into the injury site of spinal cord, some of them appeared to lose the neural phenotypes and instead transdifferentiated into myelin-forming cells at 8 weeks. In the latter, the MSC-derived myelin-forming cells established myelin sheaths associated with the host regenerating axons. And the injured host neurons were rescued, and axon regeneration was induced by grafted MSCs modified genetically. In addition, the cortical motor evoked potential and hindlimb locomotion were significantly ameliorated in the rat spinal cord transected in the MN + MT group compared with the GS and MSC groups. Grafted MSC-derived neural-like cells in the GS scaffold can transdifferentiate into myelin-forming cells in the completely transected rat spinal cord.","gelatin","pubmed"

Intra-GS formation of MSC assemblies emulating neural network (MSC-GS) were verified morphologically via electron microscopy (EM) and functionally by whole-cell patch clamp recording of spontaneous post-synaptic currents. The differentiated MSCs still partially maintained prototypic property with the expression of some mesodermal cytokines. MSC-GS or GS was then grafted acutely into a 2 mm-wide transection gap in the T9-T10 spinal cord segments of adult rats. Eight weeks later, hindlimb function of the MSC-GS-treated SCT rats was significantly improved relative to controls receiving the GS or lesion only as indicated by BBB score. The MSC-GS transplantation also significantly recovered cortical motor evoked potential (CMEP). Histologically, MSC-derived neuron-like cells maintained their synapse-like structures in vivo; they additionally formed similar connections with host neurites (i.e., mostly serotonergic fibers plus a few corticospinal axons; validated by double-labeled immuno-EM). Moreover, motor cortex electrical stimulation triggered c-fos expression in the grafted and lumbar spinal cord cells of the treated rats only. Our data suggest that MSC-derived neuron-like cells resulting from NT-3-TrkC-induced differentiation can partially integrate into transected spinal cord and this strategy should be further investigated for reconstructing disrupted neural circuits.","gelatin","pubmed"

The fate of the transplanted NSCs under the various conditions was examined by double immunofluorescence staining, using markers for neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with BrdU. Ultrastructural changes of the SCI site following the various treatments were examined under a transmission electron microscope. The number of double positive cells for glial fibrillary acidic protein and BrdU in the BYHWD + NSC group was significantly decreased when compared with that in the NSC group (P<0.05). However, the number of cells that were labeled double positive for myelin basic protein and BrdU, as well as neuron specific enolase and BrdU, was greater in the BYHWD + NSC group when compared with the NSC group. Electron microscopy demonstrated that treatment with BYHWD combined with NSCs significantly alleviated demyelination. Results from the BBB motor function test exhibited a significant improvement in the BYHWD + NSC group when compared with the SCI, BYHWD and NSC only groups. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the traditional Chinese medicine formula, BYHWD, exerted an effect on the differentiation and migration of NSCs. Combining the administration of BYHWD with NSCs was shown to have a synergistic effect on the recovery of neurological function, mitigating the progress of demyelination or ameliorating the recovery of myelination.","gelatin","pubmed"

Theoretically, it is expected that early blockade of activation of MMPs can provide neuro-protective effects from secondary tissue damage and improve functional neurological outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and to determine the regulatory effect of melatonin on MMP expression and activity after photochemically induced SCI in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300 g (age 8 weeks) received focal ischemia by photothrombosis using Rose Bengal (RB). The injured animals were divided into two groups; one group received 50 mg/kg of melatonin intraperitoneally, starting 1 h after injury and at 12 h intervals for 7 days, while animals in the control group received weight-adjusted doses of a saline vehicle. In each group, the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by Western blot and gelatin zymography at various times from 6 h to 3 days. The locomotor function was assessed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale at 3 days after SCI and then once per week for 4 weeks. The animals were killed at 28 days after the injury, and the histopathology of the lesions was assessed. The expressions and activities of MMP-9 were increased at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI in the control group. In the melatonin-treated group, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI compared with the control group, and the activity of MMP-9 was significantly reduced at 72 h after SCI. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the MMP-2 level in both groups during the experimental period. Melatonin treatment following photochemically induced SCI in rats significantly ameliorated the functional deficits. On histopathologic examination, the lesion size in the spinal cord after photothrombotic insult was significantly reduced by melatonin administration. This study showed that the up-regulation of MMP-9 correlated with the secondary damage after SCI in rats. The results of this study suggest that the ability of melatonin to reduce secondary tissue damage is intimately related to the reduction of MMP-9 expression, resulting in functional improvement.","gelatin","pubmed"

To investigate the effects of a sustained-release system of bFGF from gelatin hydrogel (GH) in a rat spinal cord contusion model. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a spinal cord contusion injury at the T10 vertebral level using an IH impactor (200 kdyn). One week after contusion, GH containing bFGF (20 µg) was injected into the lesion epicenter (bFGF - GH group). The GH-only group was designated as the control. Locomotor recovery was assessed over 9 weeks by Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan rating scale, along with inclined plane and Rota-rod testing. Sensory abnormalities in the hind paws of all the rats were evaluated at 5, 7, and 9 weeks. There were no significant differences in any of the motor assessments at any time point between the bFGF - GH group and the control GH group. The control GH group showed significantly more mechanical allodynia than did the group prior to injury. In contrast, the bFGF - GH group showed no statistically significant changes of mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared with pre-injury. Our findings suggest that bFGF-incorporated GH could have therapeutic potential for alleviating mechanical allodynia following spinal cord injury.","gelatin","pubmed"

Two months after transplantation of scaffolds, acid sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) positive cells expressing microtubule associated protein 2 (Map2) were observed as well as expressing adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in spinal cord. GFAP positive cells were distributed at the rostral and caudal of the injury/graft area in the GS and PLGA groups. Western blot showed ASIC1a and GFAP expression of injured spinal cord was downregulated in the GS group. The number of CD68 positive cells was fewer and NF nerve fibers were more in the GS group. Nissl staining and cell counting showed that the number of survival neurons was comparable between the GS and PLGA groups in the pyramidal layer of sensorimotor cortex and the red nucleus of midbrain. However, in the Clarke's nucleus at L1 spinal segment, the surviving neurons in the GS group were more numerous than that in the PLGA group. H&E staining showed that the tissue cavities in the GS group were smaller in size than that in the PLGA group. The results suggest that GS scaffold is more suitable for transplantation to promote the recovery of spinal cord injury compared with PLGA scaffold.","gelatin","pubmed"

Gelatin sponge blocks containing a Schwann cell suspension were transplanted into the injury site in the Schwann cell group; Schwann cells seeded in alginic acid sodium hydrogel were transplanted into the injury site in the Schwann cells-alginic acid sodium hydrogel group. At 12 h, 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after surgery, animals were assessed on the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and then were sacrificed. In the injury group, Bcl-2 immunoreactive cells peaked at 3 days after surgery, and the expression level returned to normal level at 14 days. In the co-transplantation group, Bcl-2 immunoreactive cells in the spinal cord-transected segments were significantly increased until 7 days (p < 0.05) and remained at this level for more than 14 days. In the injury group, the number of apoptotic cells was the highest, as compared with the other 3 groups, and peaked at 1 and 7 days following spinal cord injury, and they were mostly distributed in the white matter. The BBB scores were significantly higher in the Schwann cells-alginic acid sodium hydrogel transplantation group than in the simple injury and Schwann cell groups (p < 0.05).

Here, we examined the effect of ethanol extract of Bupleurum falcatum (BF) on functional recovery by inhibiting MMP-2 and -9 activation and inflammation after SCI. Rats received a moderate, weight-drop contusion injury to spinal cord were administered orally with BF at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 14 d and functional recovery was measured by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor open field behavioral rating test, inclined plane test and foot print analysis. To examine the neuroprotective effect of BF, TUNEL staining and counting were also performed. In addition, the expression and/or activation of MMP-2, MMP-9 and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were examined by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography using spinal cord tissue from 1 d after injury. Our data showed that BF significantly inhibited the expression and activation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 after SCI. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were also significantly attenuated by BF. Furthermore, BF reduced apoptotic cell death at 1 d after injury, thereby significantly reduced lesion volume and improved functional recovery.

Results Astroglias and RhoA labeled non-neuronal cells accumulated in the area adjacent to the implant, while the number of RhoA-positive cells was decreased dramatically in the absence of implant. Animals implanted with agarose gelatin recovered more quickly than those with PLA, concomitant with a higher survival rate of the neurons. Conclusion Both PLA and agarose gelatin benefited the recovery of spinal cord after injury by providing a scaffold for astroglia processes.

Endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4), resulting in blocking of GLP-1/GLP1R signalling process. Sitagliptin, a highly selective inhibitor of DPP4, has approved to have beneficial effects on diseases in which neurons damaged. However, the roles and the underlying mechanisms of sitagliptin in SCI repairing remain unclear. In this study, we used a rat model of SCI and PC12 cells/primary cortical neurons to explore the mechanism of sitagliptin underlying SCI recovery. We discovered the expression of GLP-1R decreased in the SCI model. Administration of sitagliptin significantly increased GLP-1R protein level, alleviated neuronal apoptosis, enhanced axon regeneration and improved functional recovery following SCI. Nevertheless, treatment with exendin9-39, a GLP-1R inhibitor, remarkably reversed the protective effect of sitagliptin. Additionally, we detected the AMPK/PGC-1α signalling pathway was activated by sitagliptin stimulating GLP-1R.

We aimed to investigate the therapeutic benefits and decipher the potential signaling pathways of liraglutide in spinal contusion injury. A SD rat model with controlled spinal contusion was established for this study. Behavioral tests and histological examinations were performed to assess the neuroprotective benefits. Several autophagy markers were measured by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining, including LC3B, Beclin-1 and p62. In addition, the AMPK-FOXO3 signaling pathway was investigated. Our results demonstrated that liraglutide treatment strongly enhanced motor function recovery and alleviated the degree of necrosis and loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord tissue after contusion. Autophagic responses were activated by liraglutide. LC3B-II/LC3B-I and Beclin-1 expression was enhanced while p62 expression was reduced.

In this study, we sought to determine whether exendin-4 plays a protective role in a rat model of SCI via SERCA2. To investigate the effects of exendin-4 on SCI, a rat model of SCI was induced by a modified version of Allen's method. Spinal cord tissue sections from rats and western blot analysis were used to examine SERCA2 expression after treatment with the long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor exendin-4 or the SERCA2 antagonist 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CE). Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale and slanting board test. Cell apoptosis was increased with CE treatment and decreased with exendin-4 treatment. Upregulation of SERCA2 in female rats with SCI resulted in an improvement of motor function scores and histological changes.

Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that MCC950 inhibited OGD-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neurons. Behavioral tests, Masson staining and GFAP immunohistochemical analysis showed that MCC950-treated mice had improved neuronal functional recovery and reduced scar formation at 28 days after SCI. H&E, Nissl and TUNEL staining confirmed that there were more living neurons and fewer apoptotic neurons in MCC950-treated mice than control mice at 3 days after SCI.

Recently, moderate microtubule stabilization by Taxol has been shown to efficiently promote neurite regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the potential for the clinical translation of Taxol in treating SCI is limited by its side effects and low ability to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). Self-assembled peptide hydrogels have shown potential as drug carriers for the local delivery of therapeutic agents. We therefore hypothesized that the localized delivery of Taxol by a self-assembled peptide scaffold would promote axonal regeneration by stabilizing microtubules during the treatment of SCI. In the present study, the mechanistic functions of the Taxol-releasing system were clarified in vitro and in vivo using immunofluorescence labeling, histology and neurobehavioral analyses. Based on the findings from the in vitro study, Taxol released from a biological functionalized SAP nanofiber scaffold (FGLmx/Taxol) remained active and promoted neurite extension. In this study, we used a weight-drop contusion model to induce SCI at T9. The local delivery of Taxol from FGLmx/Taxol significantly decreased glial scarring and increased the number of nerve fibers compared with the use of FGLmx and 5% glucose. Furthermore, animals administered FGLmx/Taxol exhibited neurite preservation, smaller cavity dimensions, and decreased inflammation and demyelination. Thus, the local delivery of Taxol from FGLmx/Taxol was effective at promoting recovery after SCI and has potential as a new therapeutic strategy for SCI.","glucose","pubmed"

We find that microRNA-421-3p is significantly decreased in cerebral I/R injury in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA-421-3p evidently suppresses pro-inflammatory factor expressions and inhibits NF-κB p65 protein expression and nuclear translocation in BV2 microglia cells treated with OGD/R. However, microRNA-421-3p neither promotes p65 mRNA expression, nor affects p65 mRNA or protein stability. Moreover, we find the m6A 'reader' protein YTH domain family protein 1 (YTHDF1) is the specific target of microRNA-421-3p, and YTHDF1 specifically binds to the m6a site of p65 mRNA to promote its translation. microRNA-421-3p prevents inflammatory response in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through targeting YTHDF1 to inhibit p65 mRNA translation. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the molecular pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury.","glucose","pubmed"

The Basso, Beatte, and Bresnahan scores method were utilized to evaluate the changes in behaviors during the recovery of the animals, and the metabolic information was measured with the 1 H-observed/13 C-edited NMR method.

Our results demonstrated that ER stress-induced apoptosis plays a significant role in injury of SCI model rats. FGF22 administration promoted recovery and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord lesions of model mice. The protective effect of FGF22 is related to decreased expression of CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78), caspase-12, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (Eif-2α) and Bad which are ER stress-induced apoptosis response proteins. Moreover, FGF22 administration also increased the number of neurons and the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) which was related to axon regeneration. We also demonstrated that the protective effect of FGF22 effectively reduces neuronal apoptosis and promotes axonal regeneration.

Moreover, patients with chronic hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) had high concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-8) of cerebrospinal fluid after SCI. Consistent with patient findings, chronic hyperglycemia before SCI in rats was associated with increased inflammatory responses and oxygen-free radicals in the spinal cord and blood, thus resulting in poor functional recovery and histological outcomes.

However, the potential protective effect of metformin on nerve regeneration after SCI is still unclear. In this study, we found that the administration of metformin improved functional recovery after SCI through reducing neuronal cell apoptosis and repairing neurites by stabilizing microtubules via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002 partly reversed the therapeutic effects of metformin on SCI in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, metformin treatment weakened the excessive activation of oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 partially abolished its antioxidant effect. We also found that the Nrf2 transcription was partially reduced by LY294002 in vitro. Taken together, these results revealed that the role of metformin in nerve regeneration after SCI was probably related to stabilization of microtubules and inhibition of the excessive activation of Akt-mediated Nrf2/ARE pathway-regulated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Methods: Primary rat BMSCs were co-cultured with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injured VSC4.1 motor neurons or primary cortical neurons. FACS analysis was used to detect the transfer of mitochondria from BMSCs to neurons. The bioenergetics profiling of neurons was detected by Extracellular Flux Analysis.

Results: MitoTracker-Red labelled mitochondria of BMSCs could be transferred to the OGD injured neurons. The gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) potentiator retinoid acid increased the quantity of mitochondria transfer from BMSCs to neurons, while GJIC inhibitor 18β glycyrrhetinic acid decreased mitochondria transfer.

A primary function of CNS astrocytes is to support the survival and function of neurons. In response to injury, astrocytes take on a reactive phenotype, which alters their molecular functions. Reactive astrocytes have been reported to be both beneficial and harmful to the CNS recovery process subsequent to injury. Understanding the molecular processes and regulatory proteins that determine the extent to which an astrocyte hinders or supports neuronal survival is important within the context of CNS repair. One protein that plays a role in modulating cellular survival is transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Global deletion of TG2 results in beneficial outcomes subsequent to in vivo ischemic brain injury. Ex vivo studies have also implicated TG2 as a negative regulator of astrocyte viability subsequent to injury. In this study we show that knocking down TG2 in astrocytes significantly increases their ability to protect neurons from oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion injury. To begin to understand how deletion of TG2 in astrocytes improves their ability to protect neurons from injury, we performed transcriptome analysis of wild type and TG2-/- astrocytes. TG2 deletion resulted in alterations in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion and axon growth/guidance. In addition, the majority of genes that showed increases in the TG2-/- astrocytes had predicted cJun/AP-1 binding motifs in their promoters. Furthermore, phospho-cJun levels were robustly elevated in TG2-/- astrocytes, a finding which was consistent with the increase in expression of AP-1 responsive genes. These in vitro data were subsequently extended into an in vivo model to determine whether the absence of astrocytic TG2 improves outcomes after CNS injury. Our results show that, following a spinal cord injury, scar formation is significantly attenuated in mice with astrocyte-specific TG2 deletion compared to mice expressing normal TG2 levels. Taken together, these data indicate that TG2 plays a pivotal role in mediating reactive astrocyte properties following CNS injury. Further, the data suggest that limiting the AP-1 mediated pro-survival injury response may be a contributing factor to that the detrimental effects of astrocytic TG2.","glucose","pubmed"

However, the effect of glucose metabolism in the spinal cord after injury remains unclear. AKR1B1, one member of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, is involved in the energy metabolism of plasm glucose and ROS production. The role of AKR1B1 in cancer cell proliferation and invasion has been confirmed. Meanwhile, Akt, one pivotal transcription factor particularly, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and ROS-mediated secondary injury in the lesion site. In our study, we established an acute SCI rat model to identify the expression of AKR1B1 and its role in neural recovery processes. Western blotting revealed the expression of AKR1B1 protein was elevated after injury, peaked at 3 days and declined gradually to normal at 14 days. Similar results was illustrated in immunohistochemistry staining of white matter. Double immunofluorescence staining showed AKR1B1 was expressed in glial cells and its expression was significantly increased in proliferative astrocytes during the pathological processes. Further experiments showed AKR1B1 was co-located with Akt protein in GFAP positive cells and immunoprecipitated with Akt in injured spinal cord as well. In summary, the present study demonstrated AKR1B1 played a vital role in astrocytes proliferation through Akt pathway, associated with the metabolism of hyperglycemia induced by SCI.","glucose","pubmed"

Here, we demonstrate that GIT1 deficiency remarkably increased neuronal apoptosis and enhanced JNK/p38 signaling, which resulted in stronger motor deficits by ischemia-reperfusion in vivo, consistent with the finding of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced neuronal injury in vitro. After treatment with JNK and p38 inhibitors, abnormally necroptotic cell death caused by GIT1 knockdown could be partially rescued, with the recovery of neuronal viability, which was still poorer than that in control neurons. Meanwhile, overactivation of JNK/p38 after GIT1 depletion was concomitant with excessive activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) that could be abolished by ASK1 silencing in HEK293T cells. Finally, GIT1 could disrupt the oligomerization of ASK1 via interaction between the synaptic localization domain that contains the coiled-coil (CC)-2 domain of GIT1 and the C-terminal CC domain of ASK1. It suppressed the autophosphorylation of ASK1 and led to decreasing activity of the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway.

High-grade fever (≥ 38°C) was associated with significantly more deranged metabolite levels than normothermia (36.5-37.5°C), that is, lower tissue glucose (median 2.0 vs 3.3 mM), higher lactate (7.8 vs 5.4 mM), higher glutamate (7.8 vs 6.4 µM), and higher lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (38.9 vs 29.3).

There are many important differences between spinal cord injury in experimental animals and in human clinical cases, making it difficult to introduce new therapies into clinical practice. Spinal cord injury is also common in pet dogs and requires new effective therapies, meaning that they can act as a translational model for the human condition while also deriving direct benefits from such research. In this study we investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of glyburide in dogs with clinical spinal cord injury. We recruited dogs that had incurred an acute thoracolumbar spinal cord injury within the previous 72 h. These had become acutely non-ambulatory on the pelvic limbs and were admitted to our veterinary hospitals to undergo anesthesia, cross sectional diagnostic imaging, and surgical decompression. Oral glyburide was given to each dog at a dose of 75 mcg/kg. In five dogs, we measured blood glucose concentrations for 10 h after a single oral dose. In six dogs, we measured serum glyburide and glucose concentrations for 24 h and estimated pharmacokinetic parameters to estimate a suitable dose for use in a subsequent clinical trial in similarly affected dogs. No detrimental effects of glyburide administration were detected in any participating dog. Peak serum concentrations of glyburide were attained at a mean of 13 h after dosing, and mean apparent elimination half-life was approximately 7 h. Observed mean maximum plasma concentration was 31 ng/mL. At the glyburide dose administered there was no observable association between glyburide and glucose concentrations in blood. Our data suggest that glyburide can be safely administered to dogs that are undergoing anesthesia, imaging and surgery for treatment of their acute spinal cord injury and can attain clinically-relevant serum concentrations without developing hazardous hypoglycemia. Serum glyburide concentrations achieved in this study suggest that a loading dose of 150 mcg/kg followed by repeat doses of 75 mcg/kg at 8-hourly intervals would lead to serum glyburide concentrations of 25-50 ng/mL within an acceptably short enough period after oral administration to be appropriate for a clinical trial in canine spinal cord injury.","glucose","pubmed"

We evaluated BSCB status using the Evans Blue dye extravasation test and measurement of tight junction (TJ) protein levels; we also assessed functional locomotor recovery. We detected autophagy-associated proteins in vivo and in vitro using both Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found that, in a rat model of SCI, LiCl attenuated the elevation in BSCB permeability, improved locomotor recovery, and inhibited the degradation of TJ proteins including occludin and claudin-5. LiCl significantly induced the extent of autophagic flux after SCI by increasing LC3-II and ATG-5 levels, and abolishing p62 accumulation. In addition, a combination of LiCl and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine not only partially eliminated the BSCB-protective effect of LiCl, but also exacerbated TJ protein degradation both in vivo and in vitro.

High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a mediator of inflammatory responses in the central nervous system and plays a critical role after SCI. Given this, we sought to identify both the role and underlying mechanisms of HMGB1 in cellular swelling and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expression in cultured rat spinal cord astrocytes after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). The post-natal day 1-2 Sprague-Dawley rat spinal cord astrocytes were cultured in vitro, and the OGD/R model was induced. We first investigated the effects of OGD/R on spinal cord astrocytic swelling and HMGB1 and AQP4 expression, as well as HMGB1 release. We then studied the effects of HMGB1 inhibition on cellular swelling, HMGB1 and AQP4 expression, and HMGB1 release. The roles of both toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in reducing cellular swelling resulting from HMGB1 inhibition in spinal cord astrocytes after OGD/R were studied. Intergroup data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test. The OGD/R increased spinal cord astrocytic swelling and HMGB1 and AQP4 expression, as well as HMGB1 release. Inhibition of HMGB1 using either HMGB1 shRNA or ethyl pyruvate resulted in reduced cellular volume, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum swelling, and lysosome number and decreased upregulation of both HMGB1 and AQP4 in spinal cord astrocytes, as well as HMGB1 release. The HMGB1 effects on spinal cord astrocytic swelling and AQP4 upregulation after OGD/R were mediated-at least in part-via activation of TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and NF-κB. These activation effects can be repressed by TLR4 inhibition using CLI-095 or C34, or by NF-κB inhibition using BAY 11-7082. Furthermore, either OGD/R or HMGB1 inhibition resulted in changes in IL-6 release. IL-6 was also shown to mediate AQP4 expression in spinal cord astrocytes. HMGB1 upregulates AQP4 expression and promotes cell swelling in cultured spinal cord astrocytes after OGD/R, which is mediated through HMGB1/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling and in an IL-6-dependent manner.","glucose","pubmed"

Rats were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, and SCI + HBO groups and the extent of neuronal damage and neurological recovery were evaluated 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. GRP78 and JNK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical, western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses, while caspase-3 activation was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SCI resulted in an upregulation in GRP78 and JNK expression compared to sham-operated animals. HBO treatment increased GRP78 level, but decreased that of JNK and suppressed caspase-3 activation as well as neuronal damage relative to the SCI group. In addition, hind limb motor function was improved by HBO treatment. HBO treatment reduces SCI-induced neuronal death and promotes the recovery of neurological function recovery by inhibiting the ERS response via modulation of GRP78 and JNK expression levels.","glucose","pubmed"

The influence of pericytes on microvessels after spinal cord injury (SCI) is less clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether pericytes took a protective effect on microvessels in melatonin-treated SCI. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, SCI group, and melatonin group (n = 27 per group). Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso Mouse Scale. Motor neurons were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Pericyte coverage was analyzed using immunofluorescence. Permeability of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) was assessed by administration of Evan's Blue. Protein levels of occludin, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Bcl-2, and Bax were determined using Western blotting. Mimicking the pathological conditions of SCI, melatonin-treated primary pericytes were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Secretion of Ang1 was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of ICAM-1 was detected by immunofluorescence. Melatonin treatment improved locomotor functional outcome and rescued motor neurons. Pericyte coverage was significantly reduced after SCI; melatonin treatment alleviated the loss of pericyte coverage and rescued perfused microvessels 7 days after injury. The permeability of BSCB and loss of occludin were attenuated, and edema formation and upregulation of AQP4 were inhibited, after melatonin treatment. The expression of Ang1 and Bcl-2 was improved, while the expression of ICAM-1 and Bax was inhibited, in melatonin-treated SCI mice. Furthermore, the secretion of Ang1 was increased and the expression of ICAM-1 was inhibited in melatonin-treated pericytes after OGD/R. Melatonin ameliorated the loss of blood vessels and disruption of BSCB to exert a protective effect on SCI, which might be mediated by increased pericyte coverage. The upregulation of Ang1 in pericytes could inhibit inflammation and apoptosis to protect the microvessels.","glucose","pubmed"

Ketones reduce neuronal excitation and promote neuroprotection. Here, we investigated the efficacy of KD as a treatment for acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Starting 4 hours following C5 hemi-contusion injury animals were fed either a standard carbohydrate based diet or a KD formulation with lipid to carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 3:1. The forelimb functional recovery was evaluated for 14 weeks, followed by quantitative histopathology. Post-injury 3:1 KD treatment resulted in increased usage and range of motion of the affected forepaw. Furthermore, KD improved pellet retrieval with recovery of wrist and digit movements. Importantly, after returning to a standard diet after 12 weeks of KD treatment, the improved forelimb function remained stable. Histologically, the spinal cords of KD treated animals displayed smaller lesion areas and more grey matter sparing. In addition, KD treatment increased the number of glucose transporter-1 positive blood vessels in the lesion penumbra and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) expression. Pharmacological inhibition of MCTs with 4-CIN (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate) prevented the KD-induced neuroprotection after SCI, In conclusion, post-injury KD effectively promotes functional recovery and is neuroprotective after cervical SCI. These beneficial effects require the function of monocarboxylate transporters responsible for ketone uptake and link the observed neuroprotection directly to the function of ketones, which are known to exert neuroprotection by multiple mechanisms. Our data suggest that current clinical nutritional guidelines, which include relatively high carbohydrate contents, should be revisited.","glucose","pubmed"

Neurologically injured patients are a unique subgroup, where optimal glycemic targets may differ, such that the findings of clinical trials involving heterogeneous critically ill patients may not apply. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intensive insulin therapy with conventional glycemic control among patients with traumatic brain injury, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, anoxic encephalopathy, central nervous system infections or spinal cord injury. Sixteen RCTs, involving 1248 neurocritical care patients, were included. Glycemic targets with intensive insulin ranged from 70-140 mg/dl (3.9-7.8 mmol/L), while conventional protocols aimed to keep glucose levels below 144-300 mg/dl (8.0-16.7 mmol/L). Tight glycemic control had no impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.83-1.17; p = 0.88), but did result in fewer unfavorable neurological outcomes (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-1.00; p = 0.04). However, improved outcomes were only observed when glucose levels in the conventional glycemic control group were permitted to be relatively high [threshold for insulin administration > 200 mg/dl (> 11.1 mmol/L)], but not with more intermediate glycemic targets [threshold for insulin administration 140-180 mg/dl (7.8-10.0 mmol/L)]. Hypoglycemia was far more common with intensive therapy (RR 3.10; 95% CI 1.54-6.23; p = 0.002), but there was a large degree of heterogeneity in the results of individual trials (Q = 47.9; p<0.0001; I2 = 75%). Mortality was non-significantly higher with intensive insulin in studies where the proportion of patients developing hypoglycemia was large (> 33%) (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.79-1.75; p = 0.44). Intensive insulin therapy significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia and does not influence mortality among neurocritical care patients. Very loose glucose control is associated with worse neurological recovery and should be avoided. These results suggest that intermediate glycemic goals may be most appropriate.","glucose","pubmed"

Induction of self-renewal and proliferation of endogenous regenerative machinery with noninvasive and nontoxic therapies could constitute a real hope and an alternative to cell transplantation for spinal cord injury patients. We previously showed that FM19G11 promotes differentiation of adult spinal cord-derived ependymal stem cells under hypoxia. Interestingly, FM19G11 induces self-renewal of these ependymal stem cells grown under normoxia. The analysis of the mechanism of action revealed an early increment of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 and 2 with an early drop of ATP, followed by a subsequent compensatory recovery with activated mitochondrial metabolism and the induction of glucose uptake by upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-4. Here we show that phosphorylation of AKT and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is involved in FM19G11-dependent activation of GLUT-4, glucose influx, and consequently in stem cell self-renewal. Small interfering RNA of uncoupling protein 1/2, GLUT-4 and pharmacological inhibitors of AKT, mTOR and AMPK signaling blocked the FM19G11-dependent induction of the self-renewal-related markers Sox2, Oct4, and Notch1. Importantly, FM19G11-treated animals showed accelerated locomotor recovery. In vivo intrathecal sustained administration of FM19G11 in rats after spinal cord injury showed more neurofilament TUJ1-positive fibers crossing the injured area surrounded by an increase of neural precursor Vimentin-positive cells. Overall, FM19G11 exerts an important influence on the self-renewal of ependymal stem progenitor cells with a plausible neuroprotective role, providing functional benefits for spinal cord injury treatment.","glucose","pubmed"

Recent evidence indicates that fluoxetine, an anti-depressant drug, is shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischaemic brain injury, but the precise mechanism underlying its protective effects is largely unknown. Here, we show that fluoxetine prevented blood-spinal cord barrier disruption via inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activation after spinal cord injury. After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with an infinite horizon impactor in the mouse, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and further administered once a day for indicated time points. Fluoxetine treatment significantly inhibited messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, 9 and 12 after spinal cord injury. By zymography and fluorimetric enzyme activity assay, fluoxetine also significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease 2 and matrix metalloprotease 9 activities after injury. In addition, fluoxetine inhibited nuclear factor kappa B-dependent matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in bEnd.3, a brain endothelial cell line, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Fluoxetine also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as zona occludens 1 and occludin after injury in vivo as well as in bEnd.3 cultures. By immunofluorescence staining, fluoxetine prevented the breakdown of the tight junction integrity in endothelial cells of blood vessel after injury. Furthermore, fluoxetine inhibited the messenger RNA expression of chemokines such as Groα, MIP1α and 1β, and prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators after injury. Finally, fluoxetine attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved locomotor function after injury. Thus, our results indicate that fluoxetine improved functional recovery in part by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease activation and preventing blood-spinal cord barrier disruption after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our study suggests that fluoxetine may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity following ischaemic brain injury and spinal cord injury in humans.","glucose","pubmed"

Axonal damage is a characteristic pathology seen in CNS injuries. Previously, it was reported that Nogo-A extracellular peptide residues 1-40 (NEP1-40), a competitive antagonist of Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1), has the ability to promote axonal regrowth and functional recovery after CNS injury. However, delivery of the therapeutic proteins into the brain parenchyma is limited due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We first generated a biologically active NEP1-40 fusion protein containing the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the transactivator of transcription (TAT), TAT-NEP1-40, which crosses the BBB in vivo after systemic delivery. The TAT-NEP1-40 can protect PC12 cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and promote neurite outgrowth when added exogenously to culture medium. The TAT-NEP1-40 protein transduced into the brain continued to sustain biological activities and protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injury through inhibition of neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, our data suggest that TAT-NEP1-40 may be a novel therapeutic candidate for axonal regeneration and functional recovery from CNS injuries such as cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, brain trauma, and also for spinal cord injury.","glucose","pubmed"

A series of 858 thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs (June 1990-June 2006) with an overall paraplegia rate of 2.7% was analyzed retrospectively. Serial segmental artery sacrifice was monitored by using somatosensory evoked potentials; segmental arteries were not reimplanted. Of a total of 20 cases of paraplegia, 3 occurred intraoperatively and 7 occurred late postoperatively: these will not be analyzed further. In 10 cases (the paraplegia group) spinal cord injury occurred within 48 hours after thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, despite intact somatosensory evoked potentials at the end of the procedure. These patients with early postoperative delayed paraplegia were compared with 10 matched control subjects who recovered without spinal cord injury. In the paraplegia group a median of 9 segmental arteries (range, 5-12 segmental arteries) were sacrificed. There were 9 male subjects: median age was 63 years (range, 40-79 years), and 4 of 10 had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A median of 9 segmental arteries (range, 2-12 segmental arteries) were also sacrificed in the matched recovery group. There were 4 male subjects; median age was 66 years (range, 40-78 years), and 8 of 10 had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. During the first 48 hours postoperatively, there were no significant differences in arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturation, partial arterial O2 and CO2 pressures, body temperature, glucose, hematocrit, or pH. The mean central venous pressures, however, were significantly higher in the paraplegic patients from 1 to 5 hours postoperatively (P = .03). In addition, although absolute mean aortic pressures did not differ between matched pairs postoperatively, when pressures were considered as a percentage of individual antecedent preoperative mean aortic pressure, paraplegic patients had significantly lower values during the first 5 hours postoperatively (P = .03). This study suggests that paraplegia can result from inadequate postoperative spinal cord perfusion caused by relatively minor differences from control subjects in perfusion parameters. Delayed paraplegia can perhaps be prevented with better hemodynamic and fluid management.","glucose","pubmed"

SCI was produced by extradural compression using modified Allen's stall with damage energy of 40 g-cm force. One group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of recombinant human insulin dissolved in 50% glucose solution at the dose of 1 IU/kg day, for 7 days. At the same time, another group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of an equal volume of sterile saline solution.

Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Ultimately, the data established the effectiveness of insulin treatment in improving neurologic recovery, increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 proteins, inhibiting caspase-3 expression decreasing neuronal apoptosis, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines iNOS and COX-2, and ameliorating microcirculation of injured spinal cord after moderate contusive SCI in rats. In sum, this study reported the beneficial effects of insulin in the treatment of SCI, with the suggestion that insulin should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent.","glucose","pubmed"

Glucose levels initially declined, but by 1 hour had normalized, and at 8 and 24 hours were significantly supranormal. The lactate/pyruvate ratio and tissue lactate concentrations increased four and five and half times, respectively, for the first 4 hours after injury. Between 8 and 24 hours, lactate levels remained elevated, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio declined to contol levels as the result of a significant rise in the tissue pyruvate concentration. This sequence of metabolic changes suggested that metabolism was probably not homogeneous throughout the injured segment, and that tissue metabolic rate was depressed for the initial 4 hours after trauma then increased in metabolically active tissue for the remainder of the 24-hour recovery period. This model of spinal cord trauma results in a severe, prolonged ischemia and metabolic injury to the affected tissue.

Despite recent advances in neurosciences, the treatment efficacy on SCI patients remains unsatisfactory, mainly due to the poor accumulation, short retention, and lack of controlled release of therapeutics in lesion tissue. Herein, an injured spinal cord targeting prodrug polymer micelle is built. An esterase-responsive bond is used to link apocynin (APO) monomer, because of the enhanced esterase activity found in microglia cells after activation, which ensures a controlled degradation of APO prodrug (Allyloxypolyethyleneglycol-b-poly [2-(((4-acetyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)carbonyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate], APEG-PAPO or PAPO) by activated microglia cells. A scar tissue-homing peptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) is introduced to the PAPO to endow the polymer micelle the lesion tissue-targeting ability. As a result, this CAQK-modified prodrug micelle (cPAM) exhibits an improved accumulation and prolonged retention in lesion tissue compared to the control micelle. The cPAM also leads to superior tissue protection and sustained motor function recovery than the control groups in a mouse model of SCI. In conclusion, the cPAM induces an effective treatment of SCI by the lesion tissue specific delivery of the prodrug polymer via its robust scar binding effect, making the scar tissue a drug releasing platform for sustained treatment of SCI.","glutamine","pubmed"

Likewise, immunostaining (TAU/TUJ-1, SOX-2/NeuN, MAP-2/PSD93, NSE, S100b, and GFAP) shown repopulated cells. Also, TRA-1-81 expression confirms the absence of immune rejection in the CBGH-GNSCs transplants. However, locomotor recovery test, gene (IL-6, CASPASE3, p14-ARF, VEGF, LCAM, BDNF, NT3, NGN2, TrKc, FGF2, Sox-2, TUJ-1, MAP-2, Nestin, and NeuN) and protein expression (TAU, TUJ-1, SOX-2 MAP-2, PSD93, NeuN, TRA-1-81, GFAP, TAU, and MBP) shows functional improvements in the CBGH-GNSCs group. Further, GABA and glutamine level demonstrates the new synaptic vesicle formation. Hence, the CBGH scaffold enhances GNSCs transplants to restore the injured spinal tissue.","glutamine","pubmed"

In this study, we aim to develop a clinically feasible way for targeted delivery of multiple drugs with different physiochemical properties to the SCI site, detail the underlying mechanism of neural recovery, and detect any synergistic effect related to combination therapy. Methods: Liposomes (LIP) modified with a scar-targeted tetrapeptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) were first constructed to simultaneously encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and then were further added into a thermosensitive heparin-modified poloxamer hydrogel (HP) with affinity-bound acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF-HP) for local administration into the SCI site (CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP) in a rat model. In vivo fluorescence imaging was used to examine the specificity of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX binding to the injured site. Multiple comprehensive evaluations including biotin dextran amine anterograde tracing and magnetic resonance imaging were used to detect any synergistic effects and the underlying mechanisms of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP both in vivo (rat SCI model) and in vitro (primary neuron). Results: The multiple drugs were effectively delivered to the injured site. The combined application of GFs and DTX supported neuro-regeneration by improving neuronal survival and plasticity, rendering a more permissive extracellular matrix environment with improved regeneration potential. In addition, our combination therapy promoted axonal regeneration via moderation of microtubule function and mitochondrial transport along the regenerating axon. Conclusion: This novel multifunctional therapeutic strategy with a scar-homing delivery system may offer promising translational prospects for the clinical treatment of SCI.","glutamine","pubmed"

This study aimed to explore the protective effects of Baicalin on rats with spinal cord injury (SCI) and its mechanism of action. The recovery of spinal cord nerve function in rats was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score and the combine behavioral score (CBS). The expressions of cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Expressions of inflammation-related proteins were detected by Western blot. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed for serum metabolites. The BBB and CBS score results showed that Baicalin had a certain improvement on rats with SCI. SCI symptoms were significantly improved in low-dose and high-dose groups. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the SCI group were significantly increased. The expressions of NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, p-IκBα, and IKKα in the SCI group showed the opposite trend compared with the low-dose and high-dose groups. Compared with the sham group, glutamine, levels of 3-OH-butyrate, N-acetylaspartate, and glutathione were significantly reduced, and the levels of glutamate and betaine were significantly increased in the SCI group. When Baicalin was administered, the contents of glutamine synthase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) were significantly reduced, indicating that Baicalin had the effect of improving GS and GLS. Baicalin has protective effects on improving SCI and lower extremity motor function, has a significant anti-inflammatory effect, and regulates the serum metabolic disorder caused by SCI in rats.","glutamine","pubmed"

The extent to which these changes have a prognostic value in the clinical recovery after surgical treatment is not yet known. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to test 2 primary hypotheses. 1) Based on evidence of corticospinal and spinocerebellar, rubro-, or reticulospinal tract degeneration/dysfunction during chronic spinal cord compression, the authors hypothesized that the metabolic profile of the primary motor cortices (M1s) and cerebellum, respectively, would be altered in patients with CSM, and these alterations would be associated with the extent of the neurological disabilities. 2) Considering that damage and/or plasticity in the remote motor system may contribute to clinical recovery, they hypothesized that M1 and cerebellar metabolic profiles would predict, at least in part, surgical outcome. METHODS The metabolic profile, consisting of N-acetylaspartate (NAA; marker of neuronal integrity), myoinositol (glial marker), choline (cell membrane synthesis and turnover), and glutamate-glutamine (glutamatergic system), of the M1 hand/arm territory in each hemisphere and the cerebellum vermis was investigated prior to surgery in 21 patients exhibiting weakness of the upper extremities and/or gait abnormalities. Age- and sex-matched controls (n = 16) were also evaluated to estimate the pre-CSM metabolic profile of these areas. Correlation and regression analyses were performed between preoperative metabolite levels and clinical status 6 months after surgery. RESULTS Relative to controls, patients exhibited significantly higher levels of choline but no difference in the levels of other metabolites across M1s. Cerebellar metabolite levels were indistinguishable from control levels. Certain metabolites-myo-inositol and choline across M1s, NAA and glutamate-glutamine in the left M1, and myo-inositol and glutamate-glutamine in the cerebellum-were significantly associated with postoperative clinical status. These associations were greatly improved by including preoperative clinical metrics into the models. Likewise, these models improved the predictive value of preoperative clinical metrics alone. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary findings demonstrate relationships between the preoperative metabolic profiles of two remote motor areas and surgical outcome in CSM patients. Including preoperative clinical metrics in the models significantly strengthened the predictive value. Although further studies are needed, this investigation provides an important starting point to understand how the changes upstream from the injury may influence the effect of spinal cord decompression.","glutamine","pubmed"

Glutamine supplementation improves clinical outcomes, but its effects on muscle function after SCI are unknown. The benefits of glutamine in non-skeletal muscle tissues involve elevated heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp25, but the muscle response may differ because it is the largest contributor to plasma glutamine. We tested the hypothesis that glutamine preserves muscle function after SCI and that this is associated with increased heat shock protein and reduced inflammatory factors, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Changes in plantarflexor force, fatigability and total myofibrillar, Hsp70, Hsp25, IL-6 and TNFα muscle protein levels were measured 7 days after sham or spinal cord transection surgery in mice receiving daily placebo or glutamine. Compared with placebo, after SCI glutamine significantly attenuated the reductions in maximal isometric force (0.22 ± 0.01 versus 0.31 ± 0.03 N, respectively) and fatigue resistance (34 ± 4 versus 59 ± 4% of initial force, respectively). Glutamine significantly ameliorated the loss of myofibrillar protein with spinal cord transection. Spinal cord transection was associated with decreased Hsp70 and Hsp25 with glutamine only (45 ± 3 and 44 ± 5% of placebo, respectively). Glutamine significantly reduced spinal cord transection-associated increases in IL-6 and TNFα compared with placebo (38 ± 6 and 37 ± 8% of placebo, respectively). Functionally, early reductions in contractile protein, force and fatigue resistance after SCI were reversed with glutamine. Spinal cord transection-associated reductions in Hsp70, Hsp25, IL-6 and TNFα with glutamine versus placebo suggest lower stress in the muscle, possibly related to a reduced need to produce glutamine. These findings support glutamine as a therapeutic intervention to accelerate recovery of muscle function after SCI.","glutamine","pubmed"

Denervation alters the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms within skeletal muscles. The hypotheses of this study were that glutamine administration to SCI rats would lead to improved functional recovery and more preserved MHC phenotypes in representative locomotor muscles. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: healthy, sham with laminectomy, laminectomized SCI untreated, and laminectomized SCI treated with glutamine. Functional performance was measured weekly for 6 wk using Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale and angle board methods. MHC composition of rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was determined using SDS-PAGE. Glutamine-treated rats had significantly higher angle board scores (P < 0.001) and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores (P < 0.01) than untreated SCI rats. Soleus of healthy rats contained 94% type 1 myosin isoform. Treated rats maintained 68%, which was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than 28% in untreated rats. The extensor digitorum longus of healthy rats contained 55% type 2b myosin. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in this isoform following SCI, but no significant difference between treated and untreated groups. There were strong correlations between higher functional scores and more preserved MHC phenotypes. Our findings suggest glutamine improves functional recovery and helps preserve myosin profile by reducing secondary SCI, thereby maintaining more nerves.","glutamine","pubmed"

Electromyographic (EMG) responses of thenar muscles to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex showed that inhibition of cortical output was weaker in the patients than the controls. Proton MRS data were collected from a plane at the level of the centrum semiovale. Two 4.5 cm3 voxels in the motor cortex and a third voxel in the ipsilateral occipital cortex were examined in the patients and control subjects. The mean level of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), expressed relative to the creatine (Cr) peak (NAA/Cr), was significantly increased in the motor cortex of the patients compared with their ipsilateral occipital cortex or either cortical area in the controls. No differences between patients and controls were seen for any of the other metabolite peaks (choline (Cho), glutamate/glutamine (Glx) or the aspartate component of NAA (AspNAA)) relative to Cr. Choline relative to Cr (Cho/Cr) was higher in the motor cortex of the control subjects than in their ipsilateral occipital cortex. This difference was not present in the patients. Raised NAA/Cr in the motor cortex of the patients probably results from increased NAA rather than a decrease in the more stable Cr. The possible relevance of a raised NAA/Cr ratio is discussed, particularly with regard to the changed corticospinal physiology and the functional recovery seen in the patients.","glutamine","pubmed"

The present study shows that glutamate immunoreactive terminals are characterized by a wide synaptic cleft, asymmetric synaptic membrane densities and spherical synaptic vesicles. Most of the glutamatergic terminals are presynaptic to small or medium size dendrites. In contrast, GABAergic terminals display typical pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, a narrow synaptic cleft and a symmetrical membrane density. Qualitative analysis indicated that 13-17 months after hemisection, the length of the synaptic active zones in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals ipsilateral to hemisection is longer than those observed in the terminals contralateral to hemisection orfin normal control cats. Furthermore, the perimeters of both dendrites and either glutamate or GABA immunoreactive terminals are longer on the hemisected side compared with those observed in the nonhemisected side of the spinal cord.

These observations suggest that release of excitatory amino acids contributes to secondary tissue damage after traumatic spinal cord injury. To further examine this hypothesis, concentrations of free amino acids were measured in spinal cord samples from anesthetized rats subjected to various degrees of impact trauma to the T9 spinal segment. Levels of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter amino acids [gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, aspartate, glycine, taurine] and levels of nonneurotransmitter amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, alanine, threonine, serine) were determined at 5 min, 4 h, and 24 h posttrauma. Uninjured surgical (laminectomy) control animals showed modest but significant declines in aspartate and glutamate levels, but not in other amino acids, at all time points. In injured animals, the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate were significantly decreased by 5 min posttrauma, and remained depressed at 4 h and 24 h as compared with corresponding laminectomy controls. In contrast, the inhibitory amino acids, glycine, GABA, and taurine, were decreased at 5 min postinjury, had partially recovered at 4 h, and were almost fully recovered at 24 h. The nonneurotransmitter amino acids were unchanged at 5 min posttrauma and significantly increased at 4 h, with partial recovery at 24 h. At 4 h postinjury, severe trauma caused significantly greater decreases in aspartate and glutamate than did either mild or moderate injury.

Preclinical studies evaluating the use of the Food and Drug Administration-approved sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel blocker glyburide in rodent models have shown reduced secondary microhaemorrhage formation and the absence of capillary fragmentation, the pathological hallmark of PHN. In this initial phase multicentre open-label pilot study, we propose to enrol 10 patients with acute cervical tSCI to primarily assess the feasibility, and safety of receiving oral glyburide within 8 hours of injury. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and preliminary evaluations on neurological recovery as well as blood and MRI-based injury biomarkers. Analysis will be performed using the descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Glyburide has been shown as an effective neuroprotective agent in preclinical tSCI models and in the treatment of ischaemic stroke with the additional risk of a hypoglycaemic response. Given the ongoing secondary injury and the traumatic hyperglycaemic stress response seen in patients with tSCI, glyburide; thus, offers an appealing neuroprotective strategy to supplement standard of care treatment. The study protocol was approved by the Ohio State University Biomedical Institutional Review Board. The protocol was amended in February 2017 with changes related to study feasibility and patient recruitment. Specifically, the route of administration was changed to the oral form to allow for streamlined and rapid drug administration, and the injury-to-drug time window was extended to 8 hours in an effort to further enhance enrolment.

Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit.

There are many important differences between spinal cord injury in experimental animals and in human clinical cases, making it difficult to introduce new therapies into clinical practice. Spinal cord injury is also common in pet dogs and requires new effective therapies, meaning that they can act as a translational model for the human condition while also deriving direct benefits from such research. In this study we investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of glyburide in dogs with clinical spinal cord injury. We recruited dogs that had incurred an acute thoracolumbar spinal cord injury within the previous 72 h. These had become acutely non-ambulatory on the pelvic limbs and were admitted to our veterinary hospitals to undergo anesthesia, cross sectional diagnostic imaging, and surgical decompression. Oral glyburide was given to each dog at a dose of 75 mcg/kg. In five dogs, we measured blood glucose concentrations for 10 h after a single oral dose. In six dogs, we measured serum glyburide and glucose concentrations for 24 h and estimated pharmacokinetic parameters to estimate a suitable dose for use in a subsequent clinical trial in similarly affected dogs. No detrimental effects of glyburide administration were detected in any participating dog. Peak serum concentrations of glyburide were attained at a mean of 13 h after dosing, and mean apparent elimination half-life was approximately 7 h. Observed mean maximum plasma concentration was 31 ng/mL. At the glyburide dose administered there was no observable association between glyburide and glucose concentrations in blood. Our data suggest that glyburide can be safely administered to dogs that are undergoing anesthesia, imaging and surgery for treatment of their acute spinal cord injury and can attain clinically-relevant serum concentrations without developing hazardous hypoglycemia. Serum glyburide concentrations achieved in this study suggest that a loading dose of 150 mcg/kg followed by repeat doses of 75 mcg/kg at 8-hourly intervals would lead to serum glyburide concentrations of 25-50 ng/mL within an acceptably short enough period after oral administration to be appropriate for a clinical trial in canine spinal cord injury.","glyburide","pubmed"

In an initial replication attempt, the Infinite Horizons impactor was used to deliver a standard unilateral contusion injury near the spinal cord midline. Glibenclamide was administered continuously via osmotic pump beginning immediately post-SCI. The ability of glibenclamide to limit intraspinal hemorrhage was analyzed at 6, 12 and 24 h post-injury using a colorimetric assay. Acute recovery (24 h) of forelimb function was also assessed. Analysis of data from these initial studies revealed no difference between glibenclamide and vehicle-treated SCI rats. Later, it was determined that differences in primary trauma affect the efficacy of glibenclamide. Indeed, the magnitude and distribution of primary intraspinal hemorrhage was greater when the impact was directed to the dorsomedial region of the cervical hemicord (as in our initial replication experiment), as compared to the dorsolateral spinal cord (as in the Simard et al. experiment). In three subsequent experiments, injury was directed to the dorsolateral spinal cord. In each case, glibenclamide reduced post-traumatic hemorrhage 24-48 h post-injury. In the third experiment, we also assessed function and found that acute reduction of hemorrhage led to improved functional recovery. Thus, independent replication of the Simard et al. data was achieved.

In situ injectable hydrogels are a particularly attractive neuroregenerative approach to improve spinal cord repair and regeneration since they can be precisely injected into the lesion site filling the space prior to gelification, decrease scarring and promote axon growth due to the hydrogel's soft structure.

However, direct administration of GFs is limited by their rapid degradation and dilution at the injured sites. Moreover, SCI recovery is a multifactorial process that requires multiple GFs to participate in tissue regeneration. Based on these facts, controlled delivery of multiple growth factors (GFs) to lesion areas is becoming an attractive strategy for repairing SCI. Presently, we developed a GFs-based delivery system (called GFs-HP) that consisted of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and heparin-poloxamer (HP) hydrogel through self-assembly mode. This GFs-HP was a kind of thermosensitive hydrogel that was suitable for orthotopic administration in vivo. Meanwhile, a 3D porous structure of this hydrogel is commonly used to load large amounts of GFs. After single injection of GFs-HP into the lesioned spinal cord, the sustained release of NGF and bFGF from HP could significantly improve neuronal survival, axon regeneration, reactive astrogliosis suppression and locomotor recovery, when compared with the treatment of free GFs or HP.

Apart from direct mechanical insult, ischemia can also cause spinal cord injury. Ischemic injury may be detected during surgery or may manifest itself postoperatively. We present 2 cases of anterior spinal artery syndrome. In the first case, a 12-year-old girl developed anterior spinal artery syndrome resulting in total quadriplegia 8 hours after spinal deformity surgery. She was treated with a steroid, immunoglobulin, and low-molecular-weight heparin. She showed complete recovery at 1 year postoperatively both clinically and radiographically. In the second case, a 62-year-old woman experienced sudden loss of motor evoked potentials intraoperatively during dural tear repair after sagittal and coronal alignment was established. The paraplegic patient was diagnosed with anterior spinal artery syndrome at the thoracic level postoperatively. She was treated with a steroid and heparin. At 1 year postoperatively, she has gained much of her strength and has myelomalacia in her spinal cord. Anterior spinal artery syndrome is a serious condition with a generally poor prognosis. Though treatment should be directed at the underlying cause, the best strategy is to prevent it from occurring. Peroperative blood pressure control, intraoperative neuromonitoring, avoidance from mechanical stress during surgery, and close neurologic and hemodynamic monitorization postoperatively should be performed.","heparin","pubmed"

The controlled release of FGF4, a novel neuroprotective factor, from a versatile Laponite hydrogel to the injured site was a promising strategy to promote axon regeneration and motor functional recovery after SCI. Methods: Characterization of Laponite, Laponite/Heparin (Lap/Hep) and Laponite/Heparin loaded with FGF4 (Lap/Hep@FGF4) hydrogels were measured by rheometer. Multiple comprehensive evaluations were used to detect motor functional recovery and the axonal rehabilitation after Lap/Hep@FGF4 treatment in vivo (SCI rat model). Moreover, microtubule dynamic and energy transportation, which regulated axonal regeneration was evaluated by Lap/Hep@FGF4 gel in vitro (primary neuron). Results: FGF4 released from Lap/Hep gel locally achieves strong protection and regeneration after SCI. The Lap/Hep@FGF4 group revealed remarkable motor functional recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI through suppressing inflammatory reaction, increasing remyelination and reducing glial/fibrotic scars. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of axonal rehabilitation were demonstrated via enhancing microtubule stability and regulating mitochondrial localization after Lap/Hep@FGF4 treatment.

CSPG-mediated inhibition is mainly associated with the glycosaminoglycan chains of CSPGs, and chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) is the predominant sulfated structure that regulates axonal guidance and growth in the adult nervous system. With the aim to find molecules that neutralize the inhibitory functions of C4S, we screened a phage display library for peptides binding to C4S. From the phage clones binding to C4S we selected three peptides for further analysis. We observed that these peptides bind to C4S, but not chondroitin-6-sulfate, heparin sulfate or dermatan sulfate, in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, whereas the scrambled peptides showed highly reduced or no binding to C4S. The C4S-binding peptides, but not their scrambled counterparts, when added to cultures of mouse cerebellar neurons and human neuroblastoma cells, neutralized the inhibitory functions of the C4S- and CSPG-coated substrate on cell adhesion, neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that the C4S-binding peptides neutralize several inhibitory functions of CSPGs, suggesting that they may be beneficial in repairing mammalian nervous system injuries.","heparin","pubmed"

Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics (LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand-receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide (1-42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures and shown to inhibit myelination.

Methods: Liposomes (LIP) modified with a scar-targeted tetrapeptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) were first constructed to simultaneously encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and then were further added into a thermosensitive heparin-modified poloxamer hydrogel (HP) with affinity-bound acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF-HP) for local administration into the SCI site (CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP) in a rat model.

These patients with polytrauma pose unique challenges to clinicians. The current review evaluates existing guidelines and updates the evidence for prehospital transport, immobilization, initial resuscitation, critical care, hemodynamic stability, diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, and timing appropriate for the patient with SCI who has multisystem trauma. Initial management should be systematic, with focus on spinal immobilization, timely transport, and optimizing perfusion to the spinal cord. There is general evidence for the maintenance of mean arterial pressure of > 85 mm Hg during immediate and acute care to optimize neurological outcome; however, the selection of vasopressor type and duration should be judicious, with considerations for level of injury and risks of increased cardiogenic complications in the elderly. Level II recommendations exist for early decompression, and additional time points of neurological assessment within the first 24 hours and during acute care are warranted to determine the temporality of benefits attributable to early surgery. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended by current guidelines for SCI. For these patients, titration of tidal volumes is important to balance the association of earlier weaning off the ventilator, with its risk of atelectasis, against the risk for lung damage from mechanical overinflation that can occur with prolonged ventilation. Careful evaluation of infection risk is a priority following multisystem trauma for patients with relative immunosuppression or compromise. Although patients with polytrauma may experience longer rehabilitation courses, long-term neurological recovery is generally comparable to that in patients with isolated SCI after controlling for demographics. Bowel and bladder disorders are common following SCI, significantly reduce quality of life, and constitute a focus of targeted therapies. Emerging biomarkers including glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100β, and microRNAs for traumatic SCIs are presented. Systematic management approaches to minimize sources of secondary injury are discussed, and areas requiring further research, implementation, and validation are identified.","heparin","pubmed"

Most approaches have been focused on providing supportive substrates for guiding neurons and overcoming the physical and chemical barriers to healing that arise after SCI. Although collagen has become a promising natural substrate with good compatibility, its low mechanical properties restrict its potential applications. The mechanical properties mainly rely on the composition and pore structure of scaffolds. For the composition of a scaffold, we used heparin sulfate to react with collagen by crosslinking. For the structure, we adopted a three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to fabricate a scaffold with a uniform pore distributions. We observed that the internal structure of the scaffold printed with a 3D bioprinter was regular and porous. We also found that both the compression modulus and strengths of the scaffold were significantly enhanced by the collagen/heparin sulfate composition compared to a collagen scaffold. Meanwhile, the collagen/heparin sulfate scaffold presented good biocompatibility when it was co-cultured with neural stem cells in vitro. We also demonstrated that heparin sulfate modification significantly improved bFGF immobilization and absorption to the collagen by examining the release kinetics of bFGF from scaffolds. Two months after implantating the scaffold into transection lesions in T10 of the spinal cord in rats, the collagen/heparin sulfate group demonstrated significant recovery of locomotor function and according to electrophysiological examinations. Parallel to functional recovery, collagen/heparin sulfate treatment further ameliorated the pathological process and markedly increased the number of neurofilament (NF) positive cells compared to collagen treatment alone.

Clinical management in the acute setting needs to occur in the intensive care unit in order to identify, prevent, and treat secondary insults from local ischemia, hypotension, hypoxia, and inflammation. Maintenance of adequate perfusion and oxygenation is quintessential and a mean arterial pressure >85-90 mm Hg should be kept for at least 1 week. A cervical collar and full spinal precautions (log-roll, flat, holding C-spine) should be maintained until the spinal column has been fully evaluated by a spine surgeon. In patients with SCI, there is a high incidence of other bodily injuries, and there should be a low threshold to assess for visceral, pelvic, and long bone injuries. Computed tomography of the spine is superior to plain films, as the former rarely misses fractures, though caution needs to be exerted as occipitocervical dislocation can still be missed. To reliably assess the spinal neural elements, soft tissues, and ligamentous structures, magnetic resonance imaging is indicated and should be obtained within 48-72 h from the time of injury. All patients should be graded daily using the American Spinal Injury Association classification, with the first prognostic score at 72 h postinjury. Patients with high cervical cord (C4 or higher) injury should be intubated immediately, and those with lower cord injuries should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, in the acute setting, respiratory mechanics will be disrupted with any spinal cord lesion above T11. Steroids have become extremely controversial, and the professional societies for neurosurgery in the United States have given a level 1 statement against their use in all patients. We, therefore, do not advocate for them at this time. With every SCI, a spine surgeon must be consulted to discuss operative vs nonoperative management strategies. Indications for surgery include a partial or progressive neurologic deficit, instability of the spine not allowing for mobilization, correction of a deformity, and prevention of potential neurologic compromise. Measures to prevent pulmonary emboli from deep venous thromboembolisms are necessary: IVC filters are recommended in bedbound patients and low-molecular weight heparins are superior to unfractionated heparin. Robust prevention of pressure ulcers as well as nutritional support should be a mainstay of treatment. Lastly, it is important to note that neurologic recovery is a several-year process. The most recovery occurs in the first year following injury, and therefore aggressive rehabilitation is crucial.","heparin","pubmed"

At each injury severity, intravenous heparin or saline was administered for 72 hours following SCI. Behavioral tests (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores, Hargreave's) were performed before killing the rats at week 7. Half of the rats were killed at day 3, and the remainder at week 7 after SCI. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and axonal retrograde tracing were conducted at both times. Subpial hemorrhage was greater in heparin-treated animals compared with controls at all severities of SCI day 3 after injury. Counterintuitively, intraparencyhmal hemorrhage was minimal in the lesion epicenter following mild SCI in the heparin-treated animals compared with controls. India ink perfusion revealed greater preservation of microcirculation in heparin-treated animals compared with a reduction in control animals. A decrease in spinal cord perfusion correlated directly with an increase in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression. There was significant gray matter sparing, but no change in white matter volume after heparin treatment at week 7 in the mild SCI group. Beneficial effects on hemorrhagic volume, axon sparing, and functional recovery following heparin treatment were not observed in the moderate or severe SCI group. Heparin treatment following SCI is safe at all degrees of injury. Heparin decreases platelet aggregation and microvascular occlusion, providing a potential neuroprotective effect following mild SCI.","heparin","pubmed"

In this review, the authors summarize the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system as well as the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of major cardiovascular complications that can occur following acute (up to 30 days) traumatic SCI. Hypotension (both supine and orthostatic), autonomic dysreflexia, and cardiac arrhythmias (including persistent bradycardia) are attributed to the loss of supraspinal control of the sympathetic nervous system that commonly occurs in patients with severe spinal cord lesions at T-6 or higher. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend: 1) monitoring of cardiac and hemodynamic parameters in the acute phase of SCI; 2) maintenance of a minimum mean arterial blood pressure of 85 mm Hg during the hyperacute phase (1 week after SCI); 3) timely detection and appropriate treatment of neurogenic shock and cardiac arrhythmias; and 4) immediate and adequate treatment of episodes of acute autonomic dysreflexia. In addition to these forms of cardiovascular dysfunction, individuals with acute SCIs are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to loss of mobility and, potentially, altered fibrinolytic activity, abnormal platelet function, and impaired circadian variations of hemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters. Current evidence supports a recommendation for thromboprophylaxis using mechanical methods and anticoagulants during the acute stage up to 3 months following SCI, depending on the severity and level of injury. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the first choice for anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend (or refute) the use of screening tests for DVT in asymptomatic adults with acute SCI, this strategy may detect asymptomatic DVT in at least 9.4% of individuals who undergo thromboprophylaxis using lowmolecular- weight heparin. Indications and treatment of DVT and acute pulmonary embolism are well established and are summarized in this review. Recognition of cardiovascular complications after acute SCI is essential to minimize adverse outcomes and to optimize recovery.","heparin","pubmed"

A heparin-based delivery system (HBDS) was used to immobilize NT-3 within fibrin scaffolds via non-covalent interactions. The fibrin scaffolds were implanted in lesions immediately after injury in an adult rat model of SCI (complete ablation of a 2 mm segment of the cord at T9). Delivery of NT-3 was controlled by an affinity-based delivery system that limits drug loss by diffusion and releases the drug via cell-mediated processes. Twelve weeks after injury and treatment, animals treated with fibrin scaffolds and NT-3, with or without the delivery system, did not show functional improvement over saline controls. Substantial cavitation at edges of the lesion was present, and while neuronal fibers were present inside the lesion, traced corticospinal and dorsal sensory tracts did not regenerate into the lesion. Therefore, while previous studies indicate that the controlled delivery of NT-3 from fibrin scaffolds may increase the short term regenerative response, the continued degeneration of the cord, indicative of the severity of the injury, limits the long term regeneration stimulated by this treatment. Chronic or repeated treatments or a less severe injury model may prove useful in assessing the utility of controlled delivery systems for the treatment of spinal cord injury.","heparin","pubmed"

This study assessed the effect of controlled delivery of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from fibrin scaffolds implanted in spinal cord lesions immediately following 2-mm ablation injury in adult rats. Nine days after injury, fibrin scaffolds containing the delivery system and NT-3 (1000 ng/mL) elicited more robust neuronal fiber growth into the lesion than did control scaffolds or saline (1.5- to 3-fold increase). Implantation of fibrin scaffolds resulted in a dramatic reduction of glial scar formation at the white matter border of the lesion. Hindlimb motor function of treated animals did not improve relative to controls at 12 weeks post-injury.

Here, we demonstrate an increase of acrolein up to 300%; the elevation lasted at least 2 weeks in a rat SCI model. More importantly, hydralazine, a known acrolein scavenger can provide neuroprotection when applied systemically. Besides effectively reducing acrolein, hydralazine treatment also resulted in significant amelioration of tissue damage, motor deficits, and neuropathic pain. This effect was further supported by demonstrating the ability of hydralazine to reach spinal cord tissue at a therapeutic level following intraperitoneal application. This suggests that hydralazine is an effective neuroprotective agent not only in vitro, but in a live animal model of SCI as well. Finally, the role of acrolein in SCI was further validated by the fact that acrolein injection into the spinal cord caused significant SCI-like tissue damage and motor deficits. Taken together, available evidence strongly suggests a critical causal role of acrolein in the pathogenesis of spinal cord trauma. Since acrolein has been linked to a variety of illness and conditions, we believe that acrolein-scavenging measures have the potential to be expanded significantly ensuring a broad impact on human health.","hydralazine","pubmed"

However, free radical scavengers have been largely ineffective in clinical trials, and as such a novel target to attenuate oxidative stress is highly warranted. In addition to free radicals, peroxidation of lipid membranes following spinal cord injury (SCI) produces reactive aldehydes such as acrolein. Acrolein is capable of depleting endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione, generating free radicals, promoting oxidative stress, and damaging proteins and DNA. Acrolein has a significantly longer half-life than the transient free radicals, and thus may represent a potentially better target of therapeutic intervention to attenuate oxidative stress. There is growing evidence, from our lab and others, to suggest that reactive aldehydes such as acrolein play a critical role in oxidative stress and SCI. The focus of this review is to summarize the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of acrolein-induced membrane damage, mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, cell death, and functional loss.

Secondary injury processes not only exacerbate pathology at the site of primary injury, but also result in spreading of injuries to the adjacent, otherwise healthy tissue. The lipid peroxidation byproduct acrolein has been implicated as one potential mediator of secondary injury. To further and rigorously elucidate the role of acrolein in secondary injury, a unique ex vivo model is utilized to isolate the detrimental effects of mechanical injury from toxins such as acrolein that are produced endogenously following SCI. We demonstrate that (i) acrolein-Lys adducts are capable of diffusing from compressed tissue to adjacent, otherwise uninjured tissue; (ii) secondary injury by itself produces significant membrane damage and increased superoxide production; and (iii) these injuries are significantly attenuated by the acrolein scavenger hydralazine. Furthermore, hydralazine treatment results in significantly less membrane damage 2 h following compression injury, but not immediately after. These findings support our hypothesis that, following SCI, acrolein is increased to pathologic concentrations, contributes significantly to secondary injury, and thus represents a novel target for scavenging to promote improved recovery.","hydralazine","pubmed"

Coadministration of the vasodilator hydralazine substantially eliminated the paralytic, anaerobic metabolic and neuropathological responses to dynorphin A. In contrast, in concentrations up to 1 mM, dynorphin A did not alter the viability of cultured rat spinal cord neurons. Thus, it appears that this peptide lacks direct neurotoxic effects and that neuronal injuries in vivo result primarily from ischemia associated with dynorphin A-induced blood flow reductions. NMDA receptor antagonists significantly improved recovery from dynorphin A-induced hindlimb paralysis, and substantially eliminated neuropathological changes without attenuating the acute blood flow reductions or lactic acid elevations. Additionally, glutamate and aspartate concentrations were increased significantly in spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid samples removed during the time that peptide-induced spinal cord blood flow reductions were observed. In contrast, neither amino acid concentration was elevated in media removed after 1-hr exposure of spinal cord neuronal cell cultures to 100 microM concentrations of dynorphin A. These results indicate that the paralysis and spinal cord injuries produced in rats after spinal subarachnoid injection of dynorphin A result predominantly from spinal cord ischemia, and further identify excitatory amino acids and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mechanisms as important mediators in this injury model.","hydralazine","pubmed"

Ten minutes of moderate intensity handbiking (54% of the maximal heart rate) during a warm-up period (W) induced an increase (P<0.05) of BDNF of approximately 1.5-fold from basal level at rest, while a decrease to basal level was found after an immediately succeeding handbiking time trial (89% of the maximal heart rate) over the marathon distance of 42 km (M). An increase (P<0.01) of serum IGF-1 was found after W and this levels remained elevated (P<0.01) until the end of M. W had no significant effects on the serum PRL and COR, however, M induced an increase (P<0.01) of both hormones. This is the first study showing elevated BDNF concentrations at rest in spinal cord-injured athletes. Furthermore, short moderate intensity handbiking but not immediately following long lasting high intensity handbiking further increases serum BDNF concentrations. IGF-1 response to exercise differs to BDNF response as this neuroplasticity-related protein remains elevated during the long lasting physical demand with high intensity. The augmented PRL concentration suggests that a possible mechanism by which exercise promotes neuroplasticity might be the activation of neural serotonergic pathways as 5-HT is the main PRL releasing factor. Elevated COR concentrations after M are unlikely to be deleterious to neuroplasticity as COR concentrations remain within the physiological range. The present study suggests that exercise might be beneficial to enhance neuroprotection and neuroplasticity, thereby improving recovery after spinal cord injury.","hydrocortisone","pubmed"

The locomotor analysis was done by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score, and Cresyl violet staining was done for lesion volume and TUNEL assay was done for apoptosis in neuronal cells. The expression of apoptotic proteins was done by the western blot study. It was evidenced that the expression of the number of miRs was altered on the 14th day post-SCI, and miR-142-3p was found to be the most significantly suppressed miR. The results suggested that overexpression of miR-142-3p by its agomir-attenuated functional recovery decreased lesion size and apoptosis of neuronal cells in rats subjected to SCI.

Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores were used to assess locomotor function. Flow cytometric analysis of AnnexinV-FITC/PI double staining, TUNEL staining, and immunoblotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins were performed to determine apoptosis in H2O2-induced cell injury of primary rat neurons. Upregulated HDAC3 and downregulated miR-27a were observed in spinal cord tissues of SCI rats and H2O2-injured neurons. HDAC3 knockdown by its specific shRNA restored the locomotor function of SCI rats and prevented rat neurons from H2O2-induced apoptosis through promotion of miR-27a. miR-27a targeted PAK6 (encoding P21-activated kinase 6) and inhibited its expression. The effects of HDAC3 knockdown on the locomotor function of SCI rats and H2O2-induced apoptosis of rat neurons were lost upon further PAK6 overexpression. The present study uncovers that silencing HDAC3 inhibited PAK6 expression by upregulating miR-27a, eventually inhibiting neuron apoptosis and promoting the recovery of SCI, which might provide a novel therapeutic target for SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

Mechanisms involving miRs induced apoptosis still needs to be investigated. In the present work we developed a rat model of SCI, followed by microarray analysis for expression of miRs at various time points after SCI. The locomotor activity was assessed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score, lesion volume was analyzed by cresyl violet staining and TUNEL staining for extent of apoptosis at various time points of post SCI. Numbers of miRs were altered after 2 weeks of SCI among which miR-466c-3p was the most significantly down-regulated. Transfection with miR-466c-3p mimics caused overexpression of miR-466c-3p, also improvement in functional recovery, decrease in apoptosis of neuronal cells and lesion size was observed in SCI rats. The Luciferase assay suggested that miR-466c-3p suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 (apoptosis regulator). It was also evidenced that upon restoring the levels of Bcl-2 with the help of pc-DNA3-Bcl-2 halted the attenuating action of miR-466c-3p in hydrogen peroxide exposed N9 microglia cells. The findings suggested that miR-466c-3p may inhibit mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via blocking Bcl-2 and cleaved capase-9/-3in rats after SCI. Altogether, the results suggested that miR-466c-3p may exert attenuating effect on functional recovery and inhibit the apoptosis of neuronal cells via halting the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade in SCI rats indicating that miR-466c-3p can be attractive therapeutic candidate in treating SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

To determine MGMT-mediated apoptosis in spinal cord injury, we performed western blot and analyzed the expression change of MGMT with different timepoints. Western blot analysis showed the upregulation of MGMT has a peak at 21 days in injured spinal cord tissues. Expression and location was observed in the neurons after SCI. Upregulation of p53, Bax, cleaved caspase3 and cleaved caspase9 and downregulation of Bcl2 were detected after SCI. Co-localization of cleaved caspase3 with MGMT indicated MGMT involved in apoptosis taking place after SCI. In addition, we carried out H2O2 stimulation to further confirm MGMT played a role in neuron apoptosis process and activated p53 signaling pathway in vitro. Finally, based above data, we packaged lenti-associated virus inhibit MGMT expression and injected into rat spinal cords after SCI model was built. LV-MGMT not only reduces the neuron apoptosis, but also increases GAP43 expression and promotes hindlimbs locomotor function recovery.

The current available clinical therapies are unable to provide effective recovery of nerve functions. Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds is a promising approach to bridge the damaged nerve tissue in the absence of the extracellular matrix. However, the treatments have been impaired by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species in the microenvironment of acute spinal cord injury. Efficient delivery of antioxidants and biocompatible materials and reagents has been a challenge. Herein, a novel hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel functionalized with the antioxidant compound 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is fabricated for nerve tissue regeneration after serious spinal cord transection in rats. TEMPO is tethered onto HA chains to form HA-TEMPO through a Schiff base reaction between 4-amino-TEMPO and aldehyde modified HA chains. The TEMPO-hydrogel is constructed with a highly porous three-dimensional structure via the gelation between the residue aldehydes in HA-TEMPO and the amines in adipic dihydrazide modified HA. The functional TEMPO-hydrogel exhibits the antioxidant effect in an H2O2 simulated in vitro peroxidative microenvironment. Implantation of the functional hydrogel in vivo induces a significant motor function restoration, which could be attributed to the effective functions of the TEMPO-hydrogel in tissue reconnection as well as nerve fiber regeneration of the central nervous spinal cord tissue. Importantly, the treatment with the TEMPO-hydrogel effectively protects the bladder tissue from neurogenic damage. Therefore, the functional TEMPO-hydrogel provides a promising strategy for the treatment of central nervous system diseases through the antioxidant and lesion-bridging regulation of the pathological microenvironment.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

Human HC016 (hHC016) cells, generated from expanded human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and pulsed with a patented protocol with hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), are expected to acquire improved resistance to oxidative environments which appears as a major limiting factor hampering the engrafting success. Our specific aim was to assess whether H2 O2 -pulsed hHC016 cells had an improved survival and thus therapeutic efficacy in a rat contusion model of acute SCI when grafted 48 hr after injury. Functional recovery was evaluated up to 56 days post-injury (dpi) by locomotor (open field test and CatWalk) and sensory (Von Frey and Hargreaves) tests. Besides, histological evaluation of transplanted cell survival and tissue protection/regeneration was also performed. Functional results showed a statistically significant improvement on locomotor recovery outcomes with hHC016 cells. Accordingly, superior cell survival in correlation with long-term neuroprotection, higher axonal regeneration, and reduced astroglial and microglial reactivity was also observed with hHC016 cells. These results demonstrate an enhanced survival capacity of hHC016 cells resulting in improved functional and histological outcomes as compared with hAMSCs, indicating that hHC016 cell transplants may constitute a promising cell therapy for acute SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

Furthermore, we tested in vitro histone H1's effect on astrocytic gene expression, cell shape and migration as well as on cell survival of cultured motoneurons. We applied histone H1 to compressed spinal cord and determined functional recovery and number of fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)- and neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)- positive glial cells, which contribute to glial scarring. Histone H1's effect on migration of astrocytes, astrocytic gene expression and motoneuronal survival was determined using scratch-wounded astroglial monolayer cultures, astrocyte cultures for microarray analysis, and motoneuron cell culture under oxidative stress conditions, respectively. Histone H1 application improves locomotor functions and enhances monoaminergic and cholinergic reinnervation of the spinal cord. Expression levels of GFAP and NG2 around the lesion site were decreased in histone H1-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated mice six weeks after injury. Histone H1 reduced astrocytic migration, changed the shape of GFAP- and NG2-positive glial cells and altered gene expression. Gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that in particular genes coding for proteins involved in proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis are dysregulated. The up- and down-regulation of distinct genes was confirmed by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Moreover, histone H1 reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death of cultured motoneurons. The combined observations indicate that histone H1 locally applied to the lesion site, improves regeneration after spinal cord injury. Some of these beneficial functions of histone H1 in vivo and in vitro can be attributed to its interaction with PSA-carrying neural cell adhesion molecule.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

Next, CONPs are administered at various does (50-4000 µg mL-1) to a contused spinal cord rat model and monitored the disease progression for up to eight weeks.

FGF2 priming facilitated the DPCs to promote axonal regeneration and to improve locomotor function in the rat with spinal cord injury (SCI). Additional analyses revealed that FGF2 priming protected cultured DPCs from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death and increased the number of DPCs in the SCI rat spinal cord even 7 weeks after transplantation. The production of major neurotrophic factors was equivalent in FGF2-treated and untreated DPCs. These observations suggest that FGF2 priming might protect DPCs from the post-trauma microenvironment in which DPCs infiltrate and resident immune cells generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species.

However, the relationship between ER stress and the integrity of BSCB in diabetic rats after SCI remains unclear. Here we observed that diabetic rats showed increased extravasation of Evans Blue (EB) dye, and loss of endothelial cells and pericytes 1 day after SCI compared to non-diabetic rats. Diabetes was also shown to induce activation of ER stress. Similar effects were observed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an ER stress inhibitor lowered the adverse effect of diabetes on SCI, reduced EB dye extravasation, and limited the loss of endothelial cells and pericytes. Moreover, 4-PBA treatment partially reversed the degradation of tight junction and adherens junction both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, diabetes exacerbates the disruption of BSCB after SCI via inducing ER stress, and inhibition of ER stress by 4-PBA may play a beneficial role on the integrity of BSCB in diabetic SCI rats, leading to improved prognosis.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

This interaction triggers intracellular signaling events leading to increased hydrogen peroxide levels which in turn promote filamentous actin (F-actin) destabilization and subsequent inhibition of axonal re-growth. In the current study, we demonstrated that treatment with galectin-1 (Gal-1), in its dimeric form, promotes a decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and F-actin repolimerization in the growth cone and in the filopodium of neuron surfaces. This effect was dependent on the carbohydrate recognition activity of Gal-1, as it was prevented using a Gal-1 mutant lacking carbohydrate-binding activity. Furthermore, Gal-1 promoted its own active ligand-mediated endocytosis together with the PlexinA4 receptor, through mechanisms involving complex branched N-glycans. In summary, our results suggest that Gal-1, mainly in its dimeric form, promotes re-activation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics via internalization of the PlexinA4/Gal-1 complex. This mechanism could explain, at least in part, critical events in axonal regeneration including the full axonal re-growth process, de novo formation of synapse clustering, axonal re-myelination and functional recovery of coordinated locomotor activities in an in vivo acute and chronic SCI model. Axonal regeneration is a response of injured nerve cells critical for nerve repair in human spinal cord injury. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling nerve repair by Galectin-1, may be critical for therapeutic intervention. Our results show that Galectin-1; in its dimeric form, interferes with hydrogen peroxide production triggered by Semaphorin3A. The high levels of this reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to be the main factor preventing axonal regeneration due to promotion of actin depolymerization at the axonal growth cone. Thus, Galectin-1 administration emerges as a novel therapeutic modality for promoting nerve repair and preventing axonal loss.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

HO-1 expression, inflammasome activation, and the presence of inflammatory cytokines were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistological staining, immunoblot, and immunoprecipitation. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. The hindlimb locomotor function was evaluated for extent of neurologic damage. In an in vitro model, hydrogen peroxide was used to induce similar inflammasome activation in cultured primary spinal cord neurons, followed by evaluation of above parameters with or without transduction of HO-1-expressing adeno-associated virus. Endogenous HO-1 expression was found in spinal cord neurons after SCI in vivo, in association with the expression of Nod-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) and the formation of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Administration of HO-1-expressing adeno-associated virus effectively decreased expression of NLRP1, therefore alleviating NLRP1 inflammasome-induced neuronal death and improving functional recovery. In the in vitro model, exogenous HO-1 expression protected neurons from hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal death by inhibiting NLRP1 expression. In addition, HO-1 inhibited expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which is a transcription factor regulating NLRP1 expression.

Accordingly, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H2 O2 , added as a bolus dose (5 μM) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1-2 μM), mimicked GTPP in counteracting the action of Nogo-66. Exogenous H2 O2 mediated this action by bypassing the requirement of 67LR.

The efficiency of MnTBAP was also compared with that of methylprednisolone - the only drug used clinically in treating acute SCI. In vivo measurements of time courses of ROS production by microdialysis and microcannula sampling in MnTBAP, methylprednisolone, and saline (as vehicle control)-treated SCI rats showed that both agents significantly reduced the production of hydrogen peroxide, but only MnTBAP significantly reduced superoxide elevation after SCI. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that MnTBAP scavenged both of the preceding ROS, whereas methylprednisolone had no effect on either. By counting the immuno-positive neurons in the spinal cord sections immunohistochemically stained with anti-nitrotyrosine and anti-4-hydroxy-nonenal antibodies as the markers of protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation, we demonstrated that MnTBAP significantly reduced the numbers of 4-hydroxy-nonenal-positive and nitrotyrosine-positive neurons in the sections at 1.55 to 2.55 mm and 1.1 to 3.1 mm, respectively, rostral to the injury epicenter compared to the vehicle-treated animals. By behavioral tests (open field and inclined plane tests), we demonstrated that at 4 hours post-SCI treatment with MnTBAP and the standard methylprednisolone regimen both significantly increased test scores compared to those produced by vehicle treatment. However, the outcomes for MnTBAP-treated rats were significantly better than those for methylprednisolone-treated animals. This study demonstrated for the first time in vivo and in vitro that MnTBAP significantly reduced the levels of SCI-elevated ROS and that MnTBAP is superior to methylprednisolone in removing ROS. Removal of ROS by MnTBAP significantly reduced protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation in neurons. MnTBAP more effectively reduced neurological deficits than did methylprednisolone after SCI - the first most important criterion for assessing SCI treatments.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression and/or activity of several MMPs, after SCI and human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cell (hUCB) treatment in rats with a special emphasis on MMP-2. Treatment with hUCB after SCI altered the expression of several MMPs in rats. MMP-2 is upregulated after hUCB treatment in spinal cord injured rats and in spinal neurons injured either with staurosporine or hydrogen peroxide. Further, hUCB induced upregulation of MMP-2 reduced formation of the glial scar at the site of injury along with reduced immunoreactivity to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Blockade of MMP-2 activity in hUCB cocultured injured spinal neurons reduced the protection offered by hUCB which indicated the involvement of MMP-2 in the neuroprotection offered by hUCB. Based on these results, we conclude that hUCB treatment after SCI upregulates MMP-2 levels and reduces the formation of the glial scar thereby creating an environment suitable for endogenous repair mechanisms.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model. Its efficacy may facilitate the development of novel drug targets for the treatment of SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

However, activation of various physiological mechanisms secondary to the initial trauma including edema, inflammation, excito-toxicity, excessive cytokine release and apoptosis may exacerbate the injury and/or retard natural repair mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSCs) inhibits H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis of cultured spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulting in increased cell survival. The ATSC extracts mediated this effect by decreasing caspase-3 and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activity, inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria and reducing Bax expression levels in cells. Direct injection of ATSC extracts mixed with Matrigel into the spinal cord immediately after SCI also resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death, astrogliosis and hypo-myelination but did not reduce the extent of microglia infiltration. Moreover, animals injected with the ATSC extract showed significant functional improvement of hind limbs as measured by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale. Collectively, these studies show a prominent therapeutic effect of ATSC cytoplasmic extracts on SCI principally caused by an inhibition of apoptosis-mediated cell death, which spares white matter, oligodendrocytes and neurons at the site of injury. The ability of ATSC extracts to prevent secondary pathological events and improve neurologic function after SCI suggests that extracts prepared from autologous cells harvested from SCI patients may have clinical utility.","hydrogen_peroxide","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury (SCI) will cause loss of physical function and dysfunction below the injury site, causing them to lose sensation and mobility, thereby reducing the quality of life of patients. Although regular rehabilitation management can reduce its severity, the current effective treatment methods are limited to the treatment of secondary injuries to SCI. The purpose of treatment should not only include the restoration of the histology of the lesion, but also should focus on the restoration of sensory and mobility and. The key to effective treatment is to reduce secondary injuries. RhoA inhibitor can improve the pathophysiological changes related to secondary injury and promote the recovery of activity ability, so it may become a clinical drug for the treatment of SCI. This article systematically analyzed the effects of RhoA inhibitors on the promotion of axon regeneration and the recovery of mobility and compared the therapeutic effects of different inhibitors on SCI and their effects on physical function recovery. We used a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the effects of Rho inhibitors on SCI treatment and the recovery of body function. 21 articles (738 animals) were identified in the literatures search. Studies were selected if they reported the therapeutic effects of RhoA/ROCK inhibitors (BA-210, EGCG, β-elemene, C3-exoenzmye, LINGO-1-Fc, Ibuprofen, SiRhoA, iRhoA + FK506, Fasudil, p21Cip1/WAF1, HA-1007, Y-27,632 and C3bot154-182). We measure the functional recovery by BBB and BMS scores. The random effect model of weighted mean difference (WMD, 95 % confidence interval) was used to analyze the effects. The WMD of the forest graph was 2.277; 95 % CI: 1.705∼2.849, P < 0.001, suggesting that RhoA inhibitors can effectively treat SCI. In addition to EGCG, all the other agents also showed the effects on the activity recovery post-SCI (P < 0.05). β-elemene, LINGO-1-Fc, Ibuprofen, SiRhoA, RhoA + FK506, Fasudil, p21Cip1/WAF1 and Y-27,632 have similar effects to BA-210, they can promote axon germination and nerve fiber regeneration after thoracic spinal cord injury and reduce the formation of syringomyelia and protect white matter, thereby improving locomotor recovery.

Glutamate release at 24 h and 8 DPL was reduced in PLLA-Ibu-T3- compared to PLLA-implanted rats, such as the estimated lesion volume at 60 DPL. The myelin- and 200-neurofilament-positive area fraction was higher in PLLA-Ibu-T3-implanted rats, where the percentage of astrocytes was significantly reduced.

These treatments included ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and ketogenic diet (KD). These were selected not only because of their previously reported efficacy in SCI models but also for their potentially different mechanisms of action.

Here we showed that, with the exception of a modest improvement in performance on the Montoya staircase test at 8-10 weeks postinjury, the combinatorial treatment with ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD did not result in any significant improvements in the rearing test, grooming test, or horizontal ladder. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords did not reveal any significant differences in tissue sparing between treatment and control groups.

We assessed risk for bias using a 9-point-item quality checklist and calculated publication bias with Egger regression and the trim and fill method. A stratified meta-analysis was used to assess the impact of study characteristics on locomotor recovery. Thirty studies (725 animals) were identified. RhoA/ROCK inhibition was found to improve locomotor outcome by 21% (95% CI, 16.0-26.6). Assessment of publication bias by the trim and fill method suggested that 30% of experiments remain unpublished. Inclusion of these theoretical missing studies suggested a 27% overestimation of efficacy, reducing the overall efficacy to a 15% improvement in locomotor recovery. Low study quality was associated with larger estimates of neurobehavioral outcome. Taking into account publication bias, RhoA/ROCK inhibition improves functional outcome in experimental SCI by 15%. This is a plausible strategy for the pharmacological augmentation of neurorehabilitation after human SCI.

Its main effects are mediated by non-specific inhibition of COX enzymes, but it also exerts some COX-independent effects, such as the inhibition of RhoA signaling and the modulation of glial activity. These effects have boosted the use of ibuprofen as a tool to promote axonal regeneration and to increase functional recovery after neural injuries, although with controversial results showing positive and negative outcomes of ibuprofen treatment in several experimental models. We have evaluated the effects of ibuprofen administered at 60 mg/kg twice a day to rats subjected to a mild spinal cord contusion. Our results indicate that ibuprofen ameliorates mechanical hyperalgesia in rats by reducing central hyperexcitability, but failed to produce improvements in the recovery of locomotion. Despite an early effect on reducing microglial reactivity, the ibuprofen treatment did not provide histological evidence of neuroprotection; indeed the volume of cord tissue spared rostral to the lesion was decreased in ibuprofen treated rats. In summary, the early modulation of neuroinflammation produced by the administration of ibuprofen seems to eventually lead to a worse resolution of detrimental events occurring in the secondary injury phase, but also to reduce the development of neuropathic pain.","ibuprofen","pubmed"

The small GTPase RhoA is a key molecule of the converging downstream cascade that leads to the inhibition of axonal re-growth. The Rho-pathway integrates growth inhibitory signals derived from extracellular cues, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, Ephrins and repulsive guidance molecule-A, into the damaged axon. Consequently, the activation of RhoA results in growth cone collapse and finally outgrowth failure. In turn, the inhibition of RhoA-activation blinds the injured axon to its growth inhibitory environment resulting in enhanced axonal sprouting and plasticity. This has been demonstrated in various CNS-injury models for direct RhoA-inhibition and for downstream/upstream blockade of the RhoA-associated pathway. In addition, RhoA-inhibition reduces apoptotic cell death and secondary damage and improves locomotor recovery in clinically relevant models after experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). Unexpectedly, a subset of ""small molecules"" from the group of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly the FDA-approved ibuprofen, has recently been identified as (1) inhibiting RhoA-activation, (2) enhancing axonal sprouting/regeneration, (3) protecting ""tissue at risk"" (neuroprotection) and (4) improving motor recovery confined to realistic therapeutical time-frames in clinically relevant SCI models.

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.","ibuprofen","pubmed"

A recent report suggested that ibuprofen promotes corticospinal axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (Fu et al., 2007). Here, we confirm that ibuprofen reduces ligand-induced Rho signaling and myelin-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro. Following 4 weeks of subcutaneous administration of ibuprofen, beginning 3 days after spinal cord contusion, animals recovered walking function to a greater degree, with twice as many rats achieving a hind limb weight-bearing status. We examined the relative role of tissue sparing, axonal sprouting, and axonal regeneration in the action of ibuprofen. Histologically, ibuprofen-treated animals display an increase in spared tissue without an alteration in astrocytic or microglial reaction. Ibuprofen increases axonal sprouting from serotonergic raphespinal axons, and from rostral corticospinal fibers in the injured spinal cord, but does not permit caudal corticospinal regeneration after spinal contusion. Treatment of mice with complete spinal cord transection demonstrates long-distance raphespinal axon regeneration in the presence of ibuprofen.

Our goal was to replicate data from a paper published by Dr. Lloyd Guth and colleagues in which combined injections of lipopolysaccharide, indomethacin and pregnenolone (referred to herein as LIP therapy) conferred marked neuroprotection in a pre-clinical model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Specifically, post-injury injection of the combination LIP therapy was found to significantly reduce tissue damage at/nearby the site of injury and significantly improve recovery of locomotor function. In this report, we confirm the primary observations made by Guth et al., however, the effects of LIP treatment were modest. Specifically, LIP treatment improved myelin and axon sparing, axonal sprouting while reducing lesion cavitation. However, spontaneous recovery of locomotion, as assessed using historical (Tarlov scoring) and more current rating scales (i.e., BBB scoring), was not affected by LIP treatment. Instead, more refined parameters of functional recovery (paw placement accuracy during grid walk) revealed a significant effect of treatment. Possible explanations for the neuroprotective effects of LIP therapy are described along with reasons why the magnitude of neuroprotection may have differed between this study and that of Guth and colleagues.","indomethacin","pubmed"

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.","indomethacin","pubmed"

Here, we show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin, the drugs widely used as pain relievers in the clinic, can surmount axon growth restrictions from myelin and proteoglycans by potently inhibiting their downstream pathway RhoA signal. Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma.

In the present report, we have analyzed the effect of the central nervous system (CNS) permissive, putatively neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-1/-2 (COX-1/-2) inhibitor indomethacin in CNS effective dosage (2 mg/kg/day) on lesional RhoA expression following subacute spinal cord injury.

At day 3 following SCI, the RhoA+ cellular composition is composed prevailingly of microglia/macrophages and polymononuclear granulocytes, but few reactive astrocytes. In contrast, in the verum group, lesional numbers of RhoA cells were reduced by indomethacin treatment by more than 60% (P < 0.0001). Inflammation-dependent RhoA expression accessible by cyclooxygenase inhibition proposes an immune-related mechanism.

Since, when appropriately activated, both astrocytes and macrophages secrete growth-promoting cytokines, we examined whether treatment with drugs that stimulate the secretory activities of these cells might promote tissue repair and reduce necrosis in the traumatized spinal cord. The spinal cord of rats was crushed extradurally at T8 and the rats were injected intraperitoneally with (i) a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or ImuVert to activate cytokine secretion, (ii) Indomethacin to reduce necrosis by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, (iii) a combination of LPS+Indomethacin, or (iv) vehicle. After 28 days the lesion site was examined quantitatively by light microscopical image analysis. The lesion of vehicle-treated control animals showed large cavities, extensive infiltration by debris-engorged macrophages, and relatively few axons. Treatment with LPS or ImuVert significantly reduced the degree of cavitation and increased the number of cells and axons in the lesion. Treatment with LPS+Indomethacin was significantly more effective than treatment with LPS alone, while treatment with Indomethacin alone was ineffective. To test whether the histopathological differences between treated and control rats might be reflected in functional improvement, rats were subjected to a contusion (weight-drop) injury and their walking ability was quantified by the Tarlov scale for 28 days postoperatively. Treatment with LPS+Indomethacin significantly improved locomotor function of animals subjected to a moderate (1.25 g x 20 cm) injury. We conclude that tissue repair and functional recovery after spinal cord injury are enhanced by combined treatment with agents that promote the secretory activities of the nonneuronal cells and that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. These results indicate that the search for more effective treatments should include studies on combinations of drugs having different pharmacological specificities.","indomethacin","pubmed"

The choroid plexus (CP) plays a regulatory role in neural regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote neurogenesis in the ventricular-subventricular zone. However, it is unclear whether MSCs interact with the CP in brain tissue repair. Rat (r)MSCs were labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) and transduced with red fluorescent protein, and then injected into the brain of rats with ischemic stroke and monitored over time by magnetic resonance imaging. The functional recovery of rats was determined by the corner test score, Modified Neurological Severity score, and stroke volume. MSCs and CP were also co-cultured for 14 days, and the medium was analyzed with a cytokine array. In vivo imaging and histologic analysis revealed that ION-labeled MSCs were mainly located at the injection site and migrated to the infarct area and to the CP. Functional recovery was greater in rats treated with MSCs as compared to those that received mock treatment. Bidirectional enhancement of proliferation in MSCs and CP was observed in the co-culture; moreover, MSCs migrated to the CP. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated levels of proliferation- and adhesion-related cytokines and chemokines in the culture medium. Wikipathway predictions indicated that insulin-like growth factor 1/Akt signaling (WP3675), chemokine signaling pathway (WP2292), and spinal cord injury (WP2432) are involved in the increased proliferation and migration of MSCs co-cultured with the CP. Crosstalk with the CP enhances MSC proliferation and migration in a transwell assay. Moreover, MRI reveals MSC migration towards the CP in an ischemic stroke model. The secreted factors resulting from this interaction have therapeutic potential for promoting functional recovery in the brain after ischemic stroke.","insulin","pubmed"

Here we designed to explore the role and underlying mechanism of IGF-1 in endothelial damage after SCI. In the current study, we established mouse microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) injury model via LPS and cDNA of IGF-1 was transfected into MVECs. In vivo SCI mice, overexpression of IGF-1 (SCI-IGF-1) and its corresponding empty vehicle (SCI-NC) were conducted using lentivirus, then apoptosis degree, component of tight junction, and inflammatory damage were evaluated. IGF-1 treatment in MVECs displayed a milder apoptosis and cell damage under LPS insult. IGF-1 increased the level of PI3K/AKT pathway, which impeded the procedure of apoptosis. Blocking of PI3K/AKT pathway markedly neutralized the effect of IGF-1 treatment. Transfection of excess IGF-1 into SCI mice significantly corrected microenvironment of neural tissue repair, reduced area of injured core and improved functional recovery with greater activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. The results above argue that the promising roles played by IGF-1 is potentially vital for developing effective future therapies in SCI.","insulin","pubmed"

There, activated microglia position themselves at the interface between infiltrating leukocytes and astrocytes, which proliferate and form a scar in response to microglia-derived factors, such as IGF-1. Depletion of microglia after SCI causes disruption of glial scar formation, enhances parenchymal immune infiltrates, reduces neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival, and impairs locomotor recovery.

Here, we aimed to obtain genetic evidence that IGF-1 signaling in the transplanted NSCs determines the beneficial effects of TMT. We transplanted NSCs heterozygous (+/-) for Igf1r, the gene encoding IGF-1 receptor, into the mouse spinal cord after injury, with or without combining TMT. We analyzed the influence of genotype and TMT on locomotor recovery and survival and migration of NSC grafts. In vitro experiments were performed to examine the potential roles of IGF-1 signaling in the migratory ability of NSCs. Mice receiving +/- NSC grafts showed impaired locomotor recovery compared with those receiving wild-type (+/+) NSCs. Locomotor improvement by TMT was more pronounced with +/+ grafts. Deficiency of one allele of Igf1r significantly reduced survival and migration of the transplanted NSCs. Although TMT did not significantly influence NSC survival, it substantially enhanced the extent of migration for only +/+ NSCs. Cultured neurospheres exhibited dynamic motility with cytoplasmic protrusions, which was regulated by IGF-1 signaling. IGF-1 signaling in transplanted NSCs may be essential in regulating their survival and migration. Furthermore, TMT may promote NSC graft-mediated locomotor recovery via activation of IGF-1 signaling in transplanted NSCs. Dynamic NSC motility via IGF-1 signaling may be the cellular basis for the TMT-induced enhancement of migration.","insulin","pubmed"

We reactivated the growth capacity of mature descending propriospinal neurons with osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor before SCI14,15; induced growth-supportive substrates with fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor; and chemoattracted propriospinal axons with glial-derived neurotrophic factor16,17 delivered via spatially and temporally controlled release from biomaterial depots18,19, placed sequentially after SCI. We show in both mice and rats that providing these three mechanisms in combination, but not individually, stimulated robust propriospinal axon regrowth through astrocyte scar borders and across lesion cores of non-neural tissue that was over 100-fold greater than controls. Stimulated, supported and chemoattracted propriospinal axons regrew a full spinal segment beyond lesion centres, passed well into spared neural tissue, formed terminal-like contacts exhibiting synaptic markers and conveyed a significant return of electrophysiological conduction capacity across lesions. Thus, overcoming the failure of axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions after maturity required the combined sequential reinstatement of several developmentally essential mechanisms that facilitate axon growth. These findings identify a mechanism-based biological repair strategy for complete SCI lesions that could be suitable to use with rehabilitation models designed to augment the functional recovery of remodelling circuits.","insulin","pubmed"

Studies have consistently demonstrated that PRP concentrates are an abundant source of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and epithelial growth factor (EGF). The complex mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury (SCI) diminish intrinsic repair and neuronal regeneration. Several studies have suggested that growth factor-promoted axonal regeneration can occur for an extended period after injury. More importantly, the delivery of exogenous growth factors contained in PRP, such as EGF, IGF-1, and TGF-β, has neurotrophic effects on central nervous system (CNS) injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. However, only a few studies have investigated the effects of PRP on CNS injuries or neurodegenerative diseases. According to our review of relevant literature, no study has investigated the effect of intrathecal (i.t.) PRP injection into the injured spinal cord and activation of intrinsic mechanisms. In the present study, we directly injected i.t. PRP into rat spinal cords and examined the effects of PRP on normal and injured spinal cords. In rats with normal spinal cords, PRP induced microglia and astrocyte activation and PDGF-B and ICAM-1 expression. In rats with SCIs, i.t. PRP enhanced the locomotor recovery and spared white matter, promoted angiogenesis and neuronal regeneration, and modulated blood vessel size. Furthermore, a sustained treatment (a bolus of PRP followed by a 1/3 dose of initial PRP concentration) exerted more favorable therapeutic effects than a single dose of PRP. Our findings suggest by i.t. PRP stimulate angiogenesis, enhancing neuronal regeneration after SCI in rats. Although PRP induces minor inflammation in normal and injured spinal cords, it has many advantages. It is an autologous, biocompatible, nontoxic material that does not result in a major immune response. In addition, based on its safety and ease of preparation, we hypothesize that PRP is a promising therapeutic agent for SCI.","insulin","pubmed"

Here, some visceral deficits of acute and chronic midline cervical (C5) contusion are similarly examined. Cranially implanted wireless stimulators delivered intermittent 8 Hz, 30-70 μA cathodal pulse trains to a brainstem microelectrode. Injured controls were given inactive stimulators; rats without injuries or implants were also compared. Rectal distension or squeezing of the forepaws caused an exaggerated rise in mean arterial pressure in injured, untreated rats under anesthesia on post-injury week 6, probably reflecting autonomic dysreflexia (AD). These pressor responses became normal when 7 days of unilateral PAG stimulation was started on the injury day. Older untreated injuries (weeks 18-19) showed normal pressor responses, but unexpectedly had significant resting and nociceptive bradycardia, which was reversed by 3 weeks of PAG stimulation started on weeks 7 or 12. Subsequent chronic studies examined gastric emptying (GE), as indicated by intestinal transit of gavaged dye, and serum chemistry. GE and fasting serum insulin were reduced on injury weeks 14-15, and were both normalized by ∼5 weeks of PAG stimulation begun in weeks 7-8. Increases in calcitonin gene-related peptide, a prominent visceral afferent neurotransmitter, measured near untreated injuries (first thoracic segment) in superficial dorsal laminae were reversed by acutely or chronically initiated PAG stimulation. The NRM, given 2-3 weeks of stimulation beginning 2 days after SCI, prevented abnormalities in both pressor responses and GE on post-injury week 9, consistent with its relaying of repair commands from the PAG. The descending PAG-NRM axis thus exhibits broadly restorative influences on visceral as well as sensory-motor deficits, improving chronic as well as acute signs of injury.","insulin","pubmed"

Here we show that post-lesional AAV-assisted co-expression of two soluble proteins, namely insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and osteopontin (OPN), in cortical neurons leads to robust CST regrowth and the recovery of CST-dependent behavioral performance after both T10 lateral spinal hemisection and a unilateral cortical stroke. In these mice, a compound able to increase axon conduction, 4-aminopyridine-3-methanol, promotes further improvement in CST-dependent behavioral tasks.

Whether the CP is involved in the recruitment of MDMs to the injured brain after ischemic stroke is unknown. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to focal cortical ischemia by permanent occlusion of the distal branch of the right middle cerebral artery. Choroid plexus tissues were collected and analyzed for Vcam1, Madcam1, Cx3cl1, Ccl2, Nt5e, and Ifnγ expression at different timepoints after stroke using qPCR. Changes of MDMs in CP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 1 day and 3 days after stroke were analyzed using flow cytometry. Infiltration of MDMs into CP and CSF were validated using β-actin-GFP chimeric mice and Fgd5-CreERT2 x Lox-stop-lox-Tomato mice. CD115+ monocytes were isolated using a magnetic cell separation system from bone marrow of Cx3cr1-GFP or wild-type C57BL/6 donor mice. The freshly isolated monocytes or M2-like MDMs primed in vitro with IL4 and IL13 were stereotaxically injected into the lateral ventricle of stroke-affected mice to trace for their migration into ischemic hemisphere or to assess their effect on post-stroke recovery using open field, corridor, and active avoidance behavioral tests. We found that CP responded to cortical stroke by upregulation of gene expression for several possible mediators of MDM trafficking and, concomitantly, MDMs increased in CP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We then confirmed that MDMs infiltrated from blood into CP and CSF after the insult using β-actin-GFP chimeric mice and Fgd5-CreERT2 x Lox-stop-lox-Tomato mice. When MDMs were directly administered into CSF following stroke, they homed to the ischemic hemisphere. If they had been primed in vitro prior to their administration to become M2-like macrophages, they promoted post-stroke recovery of motor and cognitive function without influencing infarct volume. Our findings suggest the possibility that autologous transplantation of M2-like MDMs into CSF might be developed into a new strategy for promoting recovery also in patients with stroke.","insulin","pubmed"

Immunofluorescence results showed that intradiencephalon HA administration increased the activated microglia 3 days post injury (dpi), promoted the proliferation of radial glial cells at 7 dpi and affected the morphology of radial glial cells at 11 dpi.

Scar removal was conducted through a single incision with a double-bladed scalpel along the stump, and scar renewal was halted by adding α,α'-dipyridyl. During the chronic injury stage, two experiments were undertaken. The first experiment was aimed at testing the therapeutic effect of INDP combined with scar removal. Sixty days after therapeutic intervention, the expression of genes encoding for TNFα, IFNγ, IL4, TGFβ, BDNF, IGF1, and GAP43 was evaluated at the site of injury. Tyrosine hydroxylase and 5-hydroxytryptamine positive fibers were also studied. Locomotor evaluations showed a significant recovery in the group treated with scar removal + INDP. Moreover; this group presented a significant increase in IL4, TGFβ, BDNF, IGF1, and GAP43 expression, but a decrease of TNFα and IFNγ. Also, the spinal cord of animals receiving both treatments presented a significant increase of serotonergic and catecholaminergic fibers as compared to other the groups. The second experiment compared the results of the combined approach versus INDP alone. Rats receiving INDP likewise showed improved motor recovery, although on a lesser scale than those who received the combined treatment. An increase in inflammation and regeneration-associated gene expression, as well as in the percentage of serotonergic and catecholaminergic fibers was observed in INDP-treated rats to a lesser degree than those in the combined therapy group. These findings suggest that INDP, both alone and in combination with scar removal, could modify the non-permissive microenvironment prevailing at the chronic phase of SCI, providing the opportunity of improving motor recovery.","insulin","pubmed"

However, rigorous examination of intensity-dependent changes in neurotrophin levels is lacking in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of locomotor exercise intensity on peripheral levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in individuals with incomplete SCI. We also explored the impact of the Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the BDNF gene on intensity-dependent changes. Serum concentrations of BDNF and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), as well as measures of cardiorespiratory dynamics, were evaluated across different levels of exercise intensity achieved during a graded-intensity, locomotor exercise paradigm in 11 individuals with incomplete SCI. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in serum BDNF at high, as compared to moderate, exercise intensities (p = 0.01) and 15 and 30 min post-exercise (p < 0.01 for both), with comparison to changes at low intensity approaching significance (p = 0.05). Serum IGF-1 demonstrated no intensity-dependent changes. Significant correlations were observed between changes in BDNF and specific indicators of exercise intensity (e.g., rating of perceived exertion; R = 0.43; p = 0.02). Additionally, the data suggest that Val66Met SNP carriers may not exhibit intensity-dependent changes in serum BDNF concentration. Given the known role of BDNF in experience-dependent neuroplasticity, these preliminary results suggest that exercise intensity modulates serum BDNF concentrations and may be an important parameter of physical rehabilitation interventions after neurological injury.","insulin","pubmed"

This case suggests that awakening BP rise can occur without increased physical activity or positional changes, in those with autonomic nerve dysreflexia associated with a spinal cord injury.

Furthermore, TSC1 increased NG2 expressing cell numbers and preserved most axons intact, facilitating remyelination and repair. These results support our hypothesis that TSC1 is an effective treatment for cell and tissue neuroprotection after SCI.

To date, although the lack of intrinsic regenerative potential is well described, a key regulatory molecular mechanism for the enhancement of both axonal regrowth and functional recovery after central nervous system injury remains elusive. While ubiquitin ligases coordinate neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity during development as well as after axonal injury, their role specifically in axonal regeneration is unknown. Following a bioinformatics network analysis combining ubiquitin ligases with previously defined axonal regenerative proteins, we found a triad composed of the ubiquitin ligases MDM4, MDM2 and the transcription factor p53 (encoded by TP53) as a putative central signalling complex restricting the regeneration program. Indeed, conditional deletion of MDM4 or pharmacological inhibition of MDM2/p53 interaction in the eye and spinal cord promote axonal regeneration and sprouting of the optic nerve after crush and of supraspinal tracts after spinal cord injury. The double conditional deletion of MDM4-p53 as well as MDM2 inhibition in p53-deficient mice blocks this regenerative phenotype, showing its dependence upon p53. Genome-wide gene expression analysis from ex vivo fluorescence-activated cell sorting in MDM4-deficient retinal ganglion cells identifies the downstream target IGF1R, whose activity and expression was found to be required for the regeneration elicited by MDM4 deletion. Importantly, we demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of the MDM2/p53-IGF1R axis enhances axonal sprouting as well as functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Thus, our results show MDM4-MDM2/p53-IGF1R as an original regulatory mechanism for CNS regeneration and offer novel targets to enhance neurological recovery.media-1vid110.1093/brain/awv125_video_abstractawv125_video_abstract.","insulin","pubmed"

Our data validated previously described sensitivity of miRNAs to SCI alone. Moreover, following SCI, intermittent noxious stimulation decreased expression of miR124 in dorsal spinal cord 24 h after stimulation and increased expression of miR129-2 in dorsal, and miR1 in ventral spinal cord at 7 days. We also found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated 1 day after SCI alone, and significantly more so, after SCI followed by tailshock. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression was significantly increased at both 1 and 7 days post-SCI, and significantly more so, 7 days post-SCI with shock. MiR1 expression was positively and significantly correlated with IGF-1, but not BDNF mRNA expression. Further, stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that a significant proportion of the changes in BDNF and IGF-1 mRNA expression were explained by variance in two groups of miRNAs, implying co-regulation. Collectively, these data show that uncontrollable nociception which activates sensorimotor circuits distal to the injury site, influences SCI-miRNAs and target mRNAs within the lesion site. SCI-sensitive miRNAs may well mediate adverse consequences of uncontrolled sensorimotor activation on functional recovery. However, their sensitivity to distal sensory input also implicates these miRNAs as candidate targets for the management of SCI and neuropathic pain.","insulin","pubmed"

Combination of TMT with NSC TP at 1 week after injury synergistically improved locomotor function. We report here that combining TMT increased the survival of grafted NSCs by >3-fold and >5-fold at 3 and 9 weeks after injury, respectively.

NSCs grafted into the injured spinal cord were under cellular stresses induced by reactive nitrogen or oxygen species, which were markedly attenuated by TMT. TMT increased the concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the CSF. Intrathecal infusion of neutralizing IGF-1 antibodies, but not antibodies against either BDNF or Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), abolished the enhanced survival of NSC grafts by TMT. The combination of TP and TMT also resulted in tissue sparing, increased myelination, and restoration of serotonergic fiber innervation to the lumbar spinal cord to a larger extent than that induced by either TP or TMT alone.

The inhibition of Ptena expression by antisense morpholino (MO) application improved spinal cord regeneration through 4 to 5weeks after injury. Retrograde tracing showed regrowth of axons from neurons of the regeneration-competent nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle in the brainstem in the Ptena MO-treated fish. Ptenb MO-treated fish recovered as well as control MO-treated fish at 4 and 5weeks after SCI, with their locomotion being similar to that of sham-injured and non-injured fish. The mRNA levels of Ptena were upregulated after SCI at the early stage after injury (12h and 6days) caudal to the lesion site, compared to the non-injured control, while the levels of Ptenb were upregulated only at 12h after injury. In situ hybridization experiments were in agreement with the qPCR measurements. At the protein level, Ptena was found to be expressed in spinal motoneurons and immature neurons. These results indicate that Ptena, but not Ptenb, inhibits regeneration in zebrafish, thus sharing this feature with PTEN in mammals. The fact that zebrafish regenerate better than mammals despite the inhibitory presence of Ptena is likely due to regeneration-conducive molecules that tip the balance from inhibition to enhancement. Interestingly, although Ptena and Ptenb have been shown to be functionally redundant in promoting the development of the fish larval central nervous system, they are not functionally redundant in the adult, suggesting that regeneration in fish is not predominantly due to the overall recapitulation of development.","insulin","pubmed"

In this study, a rat model was used to investigate the effect of treadmill exercise on SCI-induced apoptosis and expression of neurotrophic factors. To produce SCI, a contusion injury (10 g × 25 mm) was applied subsequent to laminectomy at the T9-T10 level. Following SCI, treadmill exercise was performed for six weeks. Hindlimb motor function was evaluated with a grid-walking test. The expression of neurotrophic factors and the level of apoptosis at the site of SCI were determined by western blotting. SCI reduced hindlimb motor function and suppressed expression of neurotrophin (NT)-3 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the ratio of phosphorylated Akt to Akt (pAkt/Akt) and the ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) to Bax (Bcl-2/Bax) were decreased, and cleaved caspase-3 expression was increased by SCI. Treadmill exercise enhanced hindlimb motor function and increased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), NT-3 and IGF-1 in the SCI rats. Treadmill exercise increased PI3K expression, the pAkt/Akt and the Bcl-2/Bax ratios, and suppressed cleaved caspase-3 expression in the injured spinal cord. This study demonstrated that treadmill exercise promotes the recovery of motor function by suppressing apoptosis in the injured spinal cord. The beneficial effect of exercise may be attributed to the increase in expression of neurotrophic factors via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.","insulin","pubmed"

Upregulation of major vault protein (MVP) expression after spinal cord injury in the brainstem of the adult zebrafish prompted us to probe for its contribution to recovery after SCI. MVP is a multifunctional protein expressed not only in many types of tumours but also in the nervous system, where its importance for regeneration is, however, unclear. Using an established zebrafish SCI model, we found that MVP mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in ependymal cells in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site at 6 and 11 days after SCI. Double immunolabelling showed that MVP was co-localised with Islet-1 or tyrosine hydroxylase around the central canal of the spinal cord in sham-injured control fish and injured fish 11 days after surgery. MVP co-localised with the neural stem cell marker nestin in ependymal cells after injury. By using an in vivo morpholino-based knock-down approach, we found that the distance moved by MVP morpholino-treated fish was reduced at 4, 5 and 6 weeks after SCI when compared to fish treated with standard control morpholino. Knock-down of MVP resulted in reduced regrowth of axons from brainstem neurons into the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site. These results indicate that MVP supports locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI in adult zebrafish.","insulin","pubmed"

Neurologically injured patients are a unique subgroup, where optimal glycemic targets may differ, such that the findings of clinical trials involving heterogeneous critically ill patients may not apply. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intensive insulin therapy with conventional glycemic control among patients with traumatic brain injury, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, anoxic encephalopathy, central nervous system infections or spinal cord injury. Sixteen RCTs, involving 1248 neurocritical care patients, were included. Glycemic targets with intensive insulin ranged from 70-140 mg/dl (3.9-7.8 mmol/L), while conventional protocols aimed to keep glucose levels below 144-300 mg/dl (8.0-16.7 mmol/L). Tight glycemic control had no impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.83-1.17; p = 0.88), but did result in fewer unfavorable neurological outcomes (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-1.00; p = 0.04). However, improved outcomes were only observed when glucose levels in the conventional glycemic control group were permitted to be relatively high [threshold for insulin administration > 200 mg/dl (> 11.1 mmol/L)], but not with more intermediate glycemic targets [threshold for insulin administration 140-180 mg/dl (7.8-10.0 mmol/L)]. Hypoglycemia was far more common with intensive therapy (RR 3.10; 95% CI 1.54-6.23; p = 0.002), but there was a large degree of heterogeneity in the results of individual trials (Q = 47.9; p<0.0001; I2 = 75%). Mortality was non-significantly higher with intensive insulin in studies where the proportion of patients developing hypoglycemia was large (> 33%) (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.79-1.75; p = 0.44). Intensive insulin therapy significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia and does not influence mortality among neurocritical care patients. Very loose glucose control is associated with worse neurological recovery and should be avoided. These results suggest that intermediate glycemic goals may be most appropriate.","insulin","pubmed"

It is considered to be a major obstacle for central nervous system (CNS) recovery after injury, especially in light of its well-known activity in limiting axonal growth. Therefore, its degradation has become a key therapeutic goal in the field of CNS regeneration. Yet, the abundant de novo synthesis of CSPG in response to CNS injury is puzzling. This apparent dichotomy led us to hypothesize that CSPG plays a beneficial role in the repair process, which might have been previously overlooked because of nonoptimal regulation of its levels. This hypothesis is tested in the present study. We inflicted spinal cord injury in adult mice and examined the effects of CSPG on the recovery process. We used xyloside to inhibit CSPG formation at different time points after the injury and analyzed the phenotype acquired by the microglia/macrophages in the lesion site. To distinguish between the resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes, we used chimeric mice whose bone marrow-derived myeloid cells expressed GFP. We found that CSPG plays a key role during the acute recovery stage after spinal cord injury in mice. Inhibition of CSPG synthesis immediately after injury impaired functional motor recovery and increased tissue loss. Using the chimeric mice we found that the immediate inhibition of CSPG production caused a dramatic effect on the spatial organization of the infiltrating myeloid cells around the lesion site, decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production by microglia/macrophages, and increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. In contrast, delayed inhibition, allowing CSPG synthesis during the first 2 d following injury, with subsequent inhibition, improved recovery. Using in vitro studies, we showed that CSPG directly activated microglia/macrophages via the CD44 receptor and modulated neurotrophic factor secretion by these cells. Our results show that CSPG plays a pivotal role in the repair of injured spinal cord and in the recovery of motor function during the acute phase after the injury; CSPG spatially and temporally controls activity of infiltrating blood-borne monocytes and resident microglia. The distinction made in this study between the beneficial role of CSPG during the acute stage and its deleterious effect at later stages emphasizes the need to retain the endogenous potential of this molecule in repair by controlling its levels at different stages of post-injury repair.","insulin","pubmed"

In these subjects BDNF concentration at rest was sixfold higher compared with the concentrations reported earlier in able-bodied persons, while IGF-1, PRL and COR were within normal range. Ten minutes of moderate intensity handbiking (54% of the maximal heart rate) during a warm-up period (W) induced an increase (P<0.05) of BDNF of approximately 1.5-fold from basal level at rest, while a decrease to basal level was found after an immediately succeeding handbiking time trial (89% of the maximal heart rate) over the marathon distance of 42 km (M). An increase (P<0.01) of serum IGF-1 was found after W and this levels remained elevated (P<0.01) until the end of M. W had no significant effects on the serum PRL and COR, however, M induced an increase (P<0.01) of both hormones. This is the first study showing elevated BDNF concentrations at rest in spinal cord-injured athletes. Furthermore, short moderate intensity handbiking but not immediately following long lasting high intensity handbiking further increases serum BDNF concentrations. IGF-1 response to exercise differs to BDNF response as this neuroplasticity-related protein remains elevated during the long lasting physical demand with high intensity. The augmented PRL concentration suggests that a possible mechanism by which exercise promotes neuroplasticity might be the activation of neural serotonergic pathways as 5-HT is the main PRL releasing factor. Elevated COR concentrations after M are unlikely to be deleterious to neuroplasticity as COR concentrations remain within the physiological range. The present study suggests that exercise might be beneficial to enhance neuroprotection and neuroplasticity, thereby improving recovery after spinal cord injury.","insulin","pubmed"

This investigation was undertaken to find out whether a combination of select neurotrophins (BDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor [GDNF], neurotrophin 3 [NT-3], or nerve growth factor [NGF]) will further enhance the neuroprotective efficacy of growth factors in SCI. The neurotrophins (0.1-1 microg/10 microL in phosphate-buffered saline) were applied 30, 60, or 90 min after injury topically over the traumatized spinal cord either alone or in combination. The SCI was performed by making a unilateral incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-T11 segment under Equithesin anesthesia. The rats were allowed to survive 5 h after trauma. Topical application of BDNF, GDNF, or NGF 30 min after SCI in high concentration (0.5 microg and 1 microg) significantly improved the motor functions and reduced the BSCB breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury seen at 5 h. These beneficial effects of neurotropins were absent when administered separately either 60 or 90 min after SCI. However, a combination of BDNF and GDNF (but not with NT-3 or NGF) given either 60 or 90 min after SCI significantly reduced the motor dysfunction and spinal cord pathology at 5 h. These novel observations suggest that a select group of neurotrophins in combination have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of SCI in clinical situations.","insulin","pubmed"

The authors investigated the role and mechanism of IGF-I gene transfer after spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies were performed in 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats after spinal cord hemisection. The authors conducted hydrodynamics-based gene transfection in which an IGF-I plasmid was rapidly injected into the rat's tail vein 30 minutes after SCI. The animals were randomly divided into four groups: Group I, sham operated; Group II, SCI treated with pCMV-IGF-I gene; Group III, SCI treated with vehicle pCMV-LacZ gene; and Group IV, SCI only. The results showed that IGF-I gene transfer promoted motor recovery, antiinflammatory responses, and antiapoptotic effects after SCI. Using techniques of Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, the authors assessed the mechanism of IGF-I gene transfer after SCI in terms of activation of Akt, inhibition of GSK-3beta, attenuation of p35, and inhibition of tau phosphorylation. Moreover, they found that IGF-I gene transfer could block caspase-9 cleavage, increase Bcl-2 formation, and thus inhibit apoptosis after SCI. The intravenous administration of IGF-I after SCI activated Akt, attenuated GSK-3beta, inhibited p35 activation, diminished tau hyperphosphorylation, ended microglia and astrocyte activation, inhibited neuron loss, and significantly improved neurological dysfunction.

Generally it is thought that spinal neural networks of motor- and interneurons located in the ventral and intermediate laminae within the lumbar intumescence of the spinal cord, also referred to as central pattern generators (CPGs), are the 'producers of locomotion' and play a pivotal role in the amelioration of locomotor deficits after SCI. It has been suggested that locomotor training provides locomotor-specific sensory feedback into the CPGs, which stimulates remodeling of central nervous system pathways, including motor systems. Several molecules have been proposed to potentiate this process but the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. To understand these mechanisms, we studied the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I in functional recovery from SCI under normal and enriched environment (EE) housing conditions. In a first experiment, we discovered that subcutaneous administration of IGF-I resulted in better locomotor recovery following SCI. In a second experiment, detailed analysis of the observed functional recovery induced by EE revealed full recovery of hindlimb coordination and stability of gait. This EE-dependent functional recovery was attenuated by alterations in the pre-synaptic bouton density within the ventral gray matter of the lumbar intumescence or CPG area. Neutralization of circulating IGF-I significantly blocked the effectiveness of EE housing on functional recovery and diminished the EE-induced alterations in pre-synaptic bouton density within the CPG area. These results support the use of IGF-I as a possible therapeutic aid in early rehabilitation after SCI.","insulin","pubmed"

Rat (r)MSCs were labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) and transduced with red fluorescent protein, and then injected into the brain of rats with ischemic stroke and monitored over time by magnetic resonance imaging. The functional recovery of rats was determined by the corner test score, Modified Neurological Severity score, and stroke volume. MSCs and CP were also co-cultured for 14 days, and the medium was analyzed with a cytokine array. In vivo imaging and histologic analysis revealed that ION-labeled MSCs were mainly located at the injection site and migrated to the infarct area and to the CP. Functional recovery was greater in rats treated with MSCs as compared to those that received mock treatment. Bidirectional enhancement of proliferation in MSCs and CP was observed in the co-culture; moreover, MSCs migrated to the CP. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated levels of proliferation- and adhesion-related cytokines and chemokines in the culture medium. Wikipathway predictions indicated that insulin-like growth factor 1/Akt signaling (WP3675), chemokine signaling pathway (WP2292), and spinal cord injury (WP2432) are involved in the increased proliferation and migration of MSCs co-cultured with the CP. Crosstalk with the CP enhances MSC proliferation and migration in a transwell assay. Moreover, MRI reveals MSC migration towards the CP in an ischemic stroke model. The secreted factors resulting from this interaction have therapeutic potential for promoting functional recovery in the brain after ischemic stroke.","iron","pubmed"

It appears to contribute to the death of tumors, ischemia-reperfusion, acute renal failure, and nervous system diseases, among others. The generative mechanism of ferroptosis includes iron overloading, lipid peroxidation, and downstream execution, while the regulatory mechanism involves the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, as well as the mevalonate pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. In-depth research has continuously developed and enriched knowledge on the mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs. In recent years, reports of the noninterchangeable role played by selenium in glutathione peroxidase 4 and its function in suppressing ferroptosis and the discovery of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, identified as a ferroptosis resistance factor parallel to the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, have expanded and deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which ferroptosis works. Ferroptosis has been reported in spinal cord injury animal model experiments, and the inhibition of ferroptosis could promote the recovery of neurological function. Here, we review the latest studies on mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs, focusing on the ferroptosis execution and the contents related to selenium and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1.

This allowed us to explore the predictive value of neuroimaging biomarkers and determine their suitability as surrogate markers for interventional trials. Changes in markers of surface morphology, myelin and iron concentration of the basal ganglia and thalamus were estimated from 182 MRI datasets acquired in 17 SCI patients and 21 healthy controls at baseline (1-month post injury for patients), after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Using regression models, we investigated group difference in linear and non-linear trajectories of these markers. Baseline quantitative MRI parameters were used to predict 24-month clinical outcome. Surface area contracted in the motor (i.e. lower extremity) and pulvinar thalamus, and striatum; and expanded in the motor thalamus and striatum in patients compared to controls over 2-years. In parallel, myelin-sensitive markers decreased in the thalamus, striatum, and globus pallidus, while iron-sensitive markers decreased within the left caudate. Baseline surface area expansions within the striatum (i.e. motor caudate) predicted better lower extremity motor score at 2-years.

For the study of inflammatory molecules in SCI rats with hesperidin treatment, rats were sacrificed at day 4 post SCI, and spinal cords were collected and studied histopathologically. Behavioral tests on hind-limbs of rats with SCI revealed that treatment of hesperidin in rats with SCI significantly ameliorate the hind-limb paralysis beginning at day 21 post SCI. Hesperidin treatment in rats with SCI reduced the neuropathological changes (e.g., hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and tissue loss) and pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrotic factor-α and interleukin-1β. In addition, oxidative stress related molecules including superoxide dismutase, catalase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and heme oxygenase-1 were also increased by hesperidin treatment. Furthermore, Fe2+, bilirubin and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase, these by-product of heme catabolism in serum and spinal cord of rats with hesperidin-treatment groups were significantly increased compared with those of vehicle-treatment group.

A rat model of Deferoxamine at thoracic 10 segment was established using a modified Allen's method. Ninety 8-week-old female Wistar rats were used. Rats in the Deferoxamine group were intraperitoneally injected with 100 mg/kg Deferoxamine 30 minutes before injury. Simultaneously, the Sham and Deferoxamine groups served as controls. Drug administration was conducted for 7 consecutive days. The results were as follows: (1) Electron microscopy revealed shrunken mitochondria in the spinal cord injury group. (2) The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating score showed that recovery of the hindlimb was remarkably better in the Deferoxamine group than in the spinal cord injury group. (3) The iron concentration was lower in the Deferoxamine group than in the spinal cord injury group after injury. (4) Western blot assay revealed that, compared with the spinal cord injury group, GPX4, xCT, and glutathione expression was markedly increased in the Deferoxamine group.

At baseline, cord area and its anterior-posterior width were decreased in patients, whereas MT, R1, and R2* parameters remained unchanged in the cord. Within the cerebellum, volume decrease was paralleled by increases of MT and R2* parameters. Early grey matter changes were observed within the primary motor cortex and limbic system. Importantly, early volume and microstructural changes of the cord and cerebellum predicted functional recovery following injury. Neurodegenerative changes rostral to the level of lesion occur early in SCI, with varying temporal and spatial dynamics.

As atrophy progressed in the thalamus, sustained iron accumulation was evident. Smaller cord and cranial corticospinal tract atrophy, and myelin changes within the sensorimotor cortices, by 6 months predicted recovery in lower extremity motor score at 2 years. Whereas greater cord atrophy and microstructural changes in the cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, and secondary sensory cortex by 6 months predicted worse sensory impairment and greater neuropathic pain intensity at 2 years.

Only few data of RLS in a context of spinal cord injury have been reported. We report the case of a woman with secondary RLS due to hemorrhage of a spinal cord cavernoma located at T9-T10.

One group of injured rats received deferoxamine, a second injured group received saline, and a third group was sham operated. Both 2 days and 2 weeks after spinal cord injury, total iron ion levels and protein expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β and the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3 in the spinal cords of the injured deferoxamine-treated rats were significantly lower than those in the injured saline-treated group.

We constructed brainstem tissue templates using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model and assessed volume loss, myelin reductions, and iron accumulation across the brainstem pathways (e.g. corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and medial lemniscus), and nuclei (e.g. red nucleus and periaqueductal grey (PAG)).

Myelin-sensitive MT and R1 were reduced in the PAG, the CSTs, the dorsal medulla and pons. No iron-sensitive changes in R2* were detected.

It has been shown to target multiple secondary injury mechanisms in spinal cord injury, via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The secondary injury mechanisms that MH can potentially target include inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, ischemia, hemorrhage, and edema. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of the multifaceted actions of MH. Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are partially achieved through conserved mechanisms such as modulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways as well as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Additionally, MH can directly inhibit calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mitochondrial calcium uptake, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzymatic activity, and iron toxicity. It can also directly scavenge free radicals. Because it can target many secondary injury mechanisms, MH treatment holds great promise for reducing tissue damage and promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury.","iron","pubmed"

Inflammatory mediators are prevalent during both phases and can influence the fate of NG2 cells and OLs. Specifically, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling induces OL genesis in the naive spinal cord, and lack of TLR4 signaling impairs white matter sparing and functional recovery after SCI. Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR4 signaling may regulate oligodendrogenesis after SCI. C3H/HeJ (TLR4-deficient) and control (C3H/HeOuJ) mice received a moderate midthoracic spinal contusion. TLR4-deficient mice showed worse functional recovery and reduced OL numbers compared with controls at 24 h after injury through chronic time points. Acute OL loss was accompanied by reduced ferritin expression, which is regulated by TLR4 and needed for effective iron storage. TLR4-deficient injured spinal cords also displayed features consistent with reduced OL genesis, including reduced NG2 expression, fewer BrdU-positive OLs, altered BMP4 signaling and inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) expression, and delayed myelin phagocytosis. Expression of several factors, including IGF-1, FGF2, IL-1β, and PDGF-A, was altered in TLR4-deficient injured spinal cords compared with wild types. Together, these data show that TLR4 signaling after SCI is important for OL lineage cell sparing and replacement, as well as in regulating cytokine and growth factor expression. These results highlight new roles for TLR4 in endogenous SCI repair and emphasize that altering the function of a single immune-related receptor can dramatically change the reparative responses of multiple cellular constituents in the injured CNS milieu. Myelinating cells of the CNS [oligodendrocytes (OLs)] are killed for several weeks after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), but they are replaced by resident progenitor cells. How the concurrent inflammatory signaling affects this endogenous reparative response is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) supports OL lineage cell sparing, long-term OL and OL progenitor replacement, and chronic functional recovery. We show that TLR4 signaling is essential for acute iron storage, regulating cytokine and growth factor expression, and efficient myelin debris clearance, all of which influence OL replacement. Importantly, the current study reveals that a single immune receptor is essential for repair responses after SCI, and the potential mechanisms of this beneficial effect likely change over time after injury.","iron","pubmed"

The collagen-rich glial-fibrous scar contains numerous axon growth inhibitory factors forming a regeneration-barrier for axons. We demonstrated previously that the combination of the iron chelator 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-decarboxylic acid (BPY-DCA) and 8-Br-cyclic AMP (cAMP) inhibits scar formation and collagen deposition, leading to enhanced axon regeneration and partial functional recovery after spinal cord injury. While BPY-DCA is not a clinical drug, the clinically approved iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) may be a suitable alternative for anti-scarring treatment (AST). In order to prove the scar-suppressing efficacy of DFO we modified a recently published in vitro model for CNS scarring. The model comprises a co-culture system of cerebral astrocytes and meningeal fibroblasts, which form scar-like clusters when stimulated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). We studied the mechanisms of TGF-β-induced CNS scarring and compared the efficiency of different putative pharmacological scar-reducing treatments, including BPY-DCA, DFO and cAMP as well as combinations thereof. We observed modulation of TGF-β-induced scarring at the level of fibroblast proliferation and contraction as well as specific changes in the expression of extracellular matrix molecules and axon growth inhibitory proteins. The individual and combinatorial pharmacological treatments had distinct effects on the cellular and molecular aspects of in vitro scarring. DFO could be identified as a putative anti-scarring treatment for CNS trauma. We subsequently validated this by local application of DFO to a dorsal hemisection in the rat thoracic spinal cord. DFO treatment led to significant reduction of scarring, slightly increased regeneration of corticospinal tract as well as ascending CGRP-positive axons and moderately improved locomotion. We conclude that the in vitro model for CNS scarring is suitable for efficient pre-screening and identification of putative scar-suppressing agents prior to in vivo application and validation, thus saving costs, time and laboratory animals.","iron","pubmed"

We have identified two factors that underlie this skewing toward M1 polarization in the injured CNS.

Additionally, iron that accumulates in macrophages in SCI increases TNF expression and the appearance of a macrophage population with a proinflammatory mixed M1/M2 phenotype. In addition, transplantation experiments show that increased loading of M2 macrophages with iron induces a rapid switch from M2 to M1 phenotype.

In this study, we tracked iPSCs-derived NSCs migration in the CNS of TBI rats and SCI monkeys in vivo for the first time. Functional recovery tests showed obvious motor function improvement in transplanted animals. These data provide the necessary foundation for future clinical application of iPSCs for CNS injury.","iron","pubmed"

The present study demonstrates the in vivo potential of IONPs to recover functional deficits in rats with complete spinal cord injury. The spinal cord was completely transected at the T11 vertebra in male albino Wistar rats. Iron oxide nanoparticle solution (25 μg/mL) embedded in 3% agarose gel was implanted at the site of transection, which was subsequently exposed to an electromagnetic field (50 Hz, 17.96 μT for two hours daily for five weeks). Locomotor and sensorimotor assessment as well as histological analysis demonstrated significant functional recovery and a reduction in lesion volume in rats with IONP implantation and exposure to an electromagnetic field. No collagenous scar was observed and IONPs were localized intracellularly in the immediate vicinity of the lesion. Further, in vitro experiments to explore the cytotoxic effects of IONPs showed no effect on cell survival. However, a significant decrease in H2O2-mediated oxidative stress was evident in the medium containing IONPs, indicating their free radical scavenging properties. These novel findings indicate a therapeutic role for IONPs in spinal cord injury and other neurodegenerative disorders mediated by reactive oxygen species.","iron","pubmed"

A conditionally immortalized neural stem cell line derived from human fetal spinal cord tissue (SPC-01) was used to treat a balloon-induced SCI. SPC-01 cells were implanted into the lesion 1 week after SCI. To determine the feasibility of tracking transplanted stem cells, a portion of the SPC-01 cells was labeled with poly-L-lysine-coated superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles, and the animals grafted with labeled cells underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Functional recovery was evaluated by using the BBB and plantar tests, and lesion morphology, endogenous axonal sprouting and graft survival, and differentiation were analyzed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to evaluate the effect of transplanted SPC-01 cells on endogenous regenerative processes. Transplanted animals displayed significant motor and sensory improvement 2 months after SCI, when the cells robustly survived in the lesion and partially filled the lesion cavity. qPCR revealed the increased expression of rat and human neurotrophin and motor neuron genes. The grafted cells were immunohistologically positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); however, we found 25% of the cells to be positive for Nkx6.1, an early motor neuron marker. Spared white matter and the robust sprouting of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43)(+) axons were found in the host tissue. Four months after SCI, the grafted cells matured into Islet2(+) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)(+) neurons, and the graft was grown through with endogenous neurons. Grafted cells labeled with poly-L-lysine-coated superparamagnetic nanoparticles before transplantation were detected in the lesion on T2-weighted images as hypointense spots that correlated with histologic staining for iron and the human mitochondrial marker MTCO2. The transplantation of SPC-01 cells produced significant early functional improvement after SCI, suggesting an early neurotrophic action associated with long-term restoration of the host tissue, making the cells a promising candidate for future cell therapy in patients with SCI.","iron","pubmed"

An optimal treatment to reverse or prevent damage would be to deliver an iron chelator systemically. Thus, we tested oral delivery of deferasirox (Exjade) in multiple studies using a rat model of mid-thoracic spinal contusion. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received a moderate contusion at vertebral level T8 and were given daily deferasirox for the first 7 or 14 days post-injury. The first two studies showed modest improvements in hindlimb function with limited improvement in tissue sparing. Two subsequent experiments to assess chronic functional changes and test longer-duration treatments failed to produce significant improvements. Testing a 2-fold higher deferasirox dose resulted in toxic side effects. To verify iron chelation treatment was effective, hepatic iron levels were measured which revealed that deferasirox robustly and significantly reduced systemic iron levels. Overall, this study suggests that oral iron chelation with deferasirox may lead to small but significant improvements in locomotor recovery or tissue sparing. However, given the lack of robust beneficial effects combined with potentially detrimental side effects such as exacerbated systemic anemia, oral administration of iron chelators may not be ideal for minimizing intraspinal iron-mediated pathology after SCI.","iron","pubmed"

EB-induced VWM demyelination significantly reduced spared VWM and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores persisting out to 2 months. Chronic hindlimb dysfunction was accompanied by a persistent inflammatory response (demonstrated by CD45(+) immunofluorescence) and axonal loss (demonstrated by NF-M immunofluorescence and electron microscopy; EM). These cellular responses differ from the rat where inflammation resolves by 3-4 weeks and axon loss is minimal following EB demyelination. As these data suggest that EB-injection in the mouse spinal cord is a non-remyelinating lesion, we sought to ask whether wheel running could promote recovery by enhancing plasticity of local lumbar circuitry independent of remyelination. This did not occur as BMS and Treadscan assessment revealed no significant effect of wheel running on recovery.

A 16.4-T small-animal MR system was employed for nondestructive imaging of post-mortem, fixed spinal cord specimens at the subacute (7 days) and more chronic (28-35 days) stages post-injury. Routine histological techniques were used for subsequent investigation of the observed neuropathology at the microscopic level. The central core of the lesion appeared as a dark hypo-intense area on MR images at all time points investigated. Small focal hypo-intense spots were also observed spreading through the dorsal funiculi proximal and distal to the site of impact, an area that is known to undergo gliosis and Wallerian degeneration in response to injury. Histological examination revealed these hypo-intense spots to be high in iron content as determined by Prussian blue staining. Quantitative image analysis confirmed the increased presence of iron deposits at all post-injury time points investigated (p<0.05). Distant iron deposits were also detectable through live imaging without the use of contrast-enhancing agents, enabling the longitudinal investigation of this pathology in individual animals. Further immunohistochemical evaluation showed that intracellular iron deposits localised to macrophages/microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the subacute phase of SCI, but predominantly to glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive, CC-1-positive astrocytes at later stages of recovery. Progressive, widespread intracellular iron accumulation is thus a normal feature of SCI in mice, and high-resolution MRI can be effectively used to detect and monitor these neuropathological changes with time.","iron","pubmed"

Although Lcn2 is expressed in a number of aseptic inflammatory conditions, its role in these conditions remains unclear. We examined the expression and role of Lcn2 after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult mice by using a contusion injury model. Lcn2 expression at the protein level is rapidly increased 12-fold at 1 d after SCI and decreases gradually thereafter, being three times as high as control levels at 21 d after injury. Lcn2 expression is strongly induced after contusion injury in astrocytes, neurons, and neutrophils. The Lcn2 receptor (Lcn2R), which has been shown to influence cell survival, is also expressed after SCI in the same cell types. Lcn2-deficient (Lcn2⁻/⁻) mice showed significantly better locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury than wild-type (Lcn2⁺/⁺) mice. Histological assessments indicate improved neuronal and tissue survival and greater sparing of myelin in Lcn2⁻/⁻ mice after contusion injury. Flow cytometry showed a decrease in neutrophil influx and a small increase in the monocyte population in Lcn2⁻/⁻ injured spinal cords. This change was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of several pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase early after SCI in Lcn2⁻/⁻ mice compared with wild-type animals. Our results, therefore, suggest a role for Lcn2 in regulating inflammation in the injured spinal cord and that lack of Lcn2 reduces secondary damage and improves locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury.","iron","pubmed"

We probed for redox signaling by determining hemeoxygenase-1 activity and by measuring expression of intracellular iron metabolism-related proteins under pro-oxidative conditions. We also employed DNA microarrays to better understand the genomic response of DRG cultures to treatment with DFO thereby enabling the generation of hypotheses. Essentially, DFO treatment resulted in outgrowth of neurofilament 200-positive neurites and induction of synapse formation as determined by immunoblotting, transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Furthermore, DFO treatment of DRG cell cultures activated neuroprotective and antioxidative programs such as matrix metallopeptidase 2 and apolipoprotein D to promote neurite regeneration. Indeed, DFO reduced markedly reactive oxygen species formation, increased the expression of hemeoxygenase-1 and improved iron management through regulation of transferrin receptor and ferritin. We propose DFO treatment of DRG cell cultures to completely abolish the oxidative effect of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)).

Morphometric measurements showed an increase in the spared white matter. MR images of the spinal cords were taken ex vivo 5 weeks after SCI using a Bruker 4.7-T spectrometer. The lesions populated by grafted MSCs appeared as dark hypointense areas. Histology confirmed a large number of iron-containing and PKH 26-positive cells in the lesion site. We conclude that treatment with three different bone marrow cell populations had a positive effect on behavioral outcome and histopathological assessment after SCI, which was most pronounced after MSC injection.","iron","pubmed"

Emerging clinical studies of treating brain and spinal cord injury (SCI) led us to examine the effect of autologous adult stem cell transplantation as well as the use of polymer scaffolds in spinal cord regeneration. We compared an intravenous injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or the injection of a freshly prepared mononuclear fraction of bone marrow cells (BMCs) on the treatment of an acute or chronic balloon-induced spinal cord compression lesion in rats. Based on our experimental studies, autologous BMC implantation has been used in a Phase I/II clinical trial in patients (n=20) with a transversal spinal cord lesion. 2. MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow by their adherence to plastic, labeled with iron-oxide nanoparticles and expanded in vitro. Macroporous hydrogels based on derivatives of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) or 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide (HPMA) were prepared, then modified by their copolymerization with a hydrolytically degradable crosslinker, N,O-dimethacryloylhydroxylamine, or by different surface electric charges. Hydrogels or hydrogels seeded with MSCs were implanted into rats with hemisected spinal cords. 3. Lesioned animals grafted with MSCs or BMCs had smaller lesions 35 days postgrafting and higher scores in BBB testing than did control animals and also showed a faster recovery of sensitivity in their hind limbs using the plantar test. The functional improvement was more pronounced in MSC-treated rats. In MR images, the lesion populated by grafted cells appeared as a dark hypointense area and was considerably smaller than in control animals. Morphometric measurements showed an increase in the volume of spared white matter in cell-treated animals. In the clinical trial, we compared intraarterial (via a. vertebralis, n=6) versus intravenous administration of BMCs (n=14) in a group of subacute (10-33 days post-SCI, n=8) and chronic patients (2-18 months, n=12). For patient follow-up we used MEP, SEP, MRI, and the ASIA score. Our clinical study revealed that the implantation of BMCs into patients is safe, as there were no complications following cell administration. Partial improvement in the ASIA score and partial recovery of MEP or SEP have been observed in all subacute patients who received cells via a. vertebralis (n=4) and in one out of four subacute patients who received cells intravenously. Improvement was also found in one chronic patient who received cells via a. vertebralis. A much larger population of patients is needed before any conclusions can be drawn. The implantation of hydrogels into hemisected rat spinal cords showed that cellular ingrowth was most pronounced in copolymers of HEMA with a positive surface electric charge. Although most of the cells had the morphological properties of connective tissue elements, we found NF-160-positive axons invading all the implanted hydrogels from both the proximal and distal stumps. The biodegradable hydrogels degraded from the border that was in direct contact with the spinal cord tissue. They were resorbed by macrophages and replaced by newly formed tissue containing connective tissue elements, blood vessels, GFAP-positive astrocytic processes, and NF-160-positive neurofilaments. Additionally, we implanted hydrogels seeded with nanoparticle-labeled MSCs into hemisected rat spinal cords. Hydrogels seeded with MSCs were visible on MR images as hypointense areas, and subsequent Prussian blue histological staining confirmed positively stained cells within the hydrogels. 4. We conclude that treatment with different bone marrow cell populations had a positive effect on behavioral outcome and histopathological assessment after SCI in rats; this positive effect was most pronounced following MSC treatment. Our clinical study suggests a possible positive effect in patients with SCI. Bridging the lesion cavity can be an approach for further improving regeneration. Our preclinical studies showed that macroporous polymer hydrogels based on derivatives of HEMA or HPMA are suitable materials for bridging cavities after SCI; their chemical and physical properties can be modified to a specific use, and 3D implants seeded with different cell types may facilitate the ingrowth of axons.","iron","pubmed"

Due to accumulation of numerous axon-growth inhibitory molecules the lesion scar is considered a major impediment for axon regeneration. Following transection of the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) at thoracic level 8 in adult rats, transient suppression of collagenous scarring in the lesion zone by local application of a potent iron chelator and cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulted in the delay of fibrous scarring. Treated animals displayed long-distance growth of CST axons through the lesion area extending for up to 1.5-2 cm into the distal cord. In addition, the treatment showed a strong neuroprotective effect, rescuing cortical motoneurons projecting into the CST that normally die (30%) after thoracic axotomy. Further, anterogradely traced CST axons regenerated through both grey and white matter and developed terminal arborizations in grey matter regions. In contrast to controls, injured animals receiving treatment showed significant functional recovery in the open field, in the horizontal ladder and in CatWalk locomotor tasks. We conclude that the fibrous lesion scar plays a pivotal role as a growth barrier for regenerating axons in adult spinal cord and that a delay in fibrotic scarring by local inhibition of collagen biosynthesis and basement membrane deposition is a promising and unique therapeutic strategy for treating human spinal trauma.","iron","pubmed"

In group C, the Tarlov's score and inclined plane angle were increased significantly at 7, 14 and 21 days, with histological improvement.

Forty-four male Wistar rats were used in two experimental series to test the hypothesis that administration of quercetin improves recovery of motor function after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Animals were subjected to laminectomy and subjected to an extradural 40-g force clip compression for 5 sec at T7. Quercetin or saline was administered intraperitoneally 1 h after injury and then every 12 hr thereafter. Recovery of motor function was assessed using BBB scores at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. A dose of 2.5 micromoles quercetin/kg body weight did not result in significantly better functional outcome, whereas doses ranging from 5 to 100 micromoles quercetin/kg body weight resulted in a significantly better functional outcome with half or more of the animals walking, although with deficit; in contrast, no animals walked in the group of saline-treated animals. No significant differences in behavioral outcome were seen amongst the doses ranging from 5 to 100 micromol/kg, nor was there a difference if animals were treated for 4 or 10 days. Therapeutic outcome was coincident with more efficient iron clearance, suggesting that one possible mechanism whereby quercetin decreases secondary damage is through iron chelation.","iron","pubmed"

However, most previous studies were performed under anesthesia, which significantly alters respiratory network. Therefore, the goal of this work was to assess spontaneous diaphragm recovery post-C2Hx in awake, freely behaving animals. Adult rats were chronically implanted with diaphragm EMG electrodes and recorded during 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Our results reveal that ipsilateral diaphragm activity partially recovers within days post-injury and reaches pre-injury amplitude in a few weeks. However, the full extent of spontaneous ipsilateral recovery is significantly attenuated by anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane). This suggests that the observed recovery may be attributed in part to activation of NMDA receptors which are suppressed by anesthesia. Despite spontaneous recovery in awake animals, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm dysfunction still persists: i) Inspiratory bursts during basal (slow) breathing exhibit an altered pattern, ii) the amplitude of sighs - or augmented breaths - is significantly decreased, and iii) the injured hemidiaphragm exhibits spontaneous events of hyperexcitation. The results from this study offer an under-appreciated insight into spontaneous diaphragm activity and recovery following high cervical spinal cord injury in awake animals.","isoflurane","pubmed"

Awake cystometry was performed at each time point on controls and 6 SCI animals, and bladder was then harvested for analysis of 29 proteins Millipore kit or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prophylactic dose of ampicillin 100 mg/kg was administered periodically to all SCI animals. Spontaneous recovery of voiding after SCI at 12 weeks was evident from increased intercontractile interval and voiding efficiency during cystometry. Expression of proinflammatory interleukins ([IL] IL-1α and IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) and CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10), CX3CL1, and CCL2 showed significant elevation at 4 and at 8 weeks with slight decrease at 12 weeks.

Intact rats and rats with SCI but no WBV-therapy (""No-WBV"") served as controls. Recovery of locomotion was determined by BBB-locomotor rating, foot stepping angle (FSA), rump-height index (RHI), correct ladder steps (CLS) and H-reflex at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks after SCI. Animals were sacrificed by an overdose of Isoflurane (Abbott). One hour later their spinal cords were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h. Samples from the thoracic cord containing the lesion site and from the lumbar intumescence were cut into 10 μm thick longitudinal frozen sections. All functioning capillaries were unequivocally identified because the endogenous peroxidase of the erythrocytes was clearly visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB). A determination of their absolute (in μm2) and proportional areas (percent of photographed tissue) revealed a significantly denser capillary network in the WBV-treated rats: 1,66 ± 0,41% in the ""vibrated"" rats versus 0,79 ± 0,19% in the ""No-WBV"" animals. The portion of the capillary network in intact rats was 1,51 ± 0,69%. Surprisingly, even though the vascularization in the treated animals was significantly increased, this had no beneficial influence on the recovery of functions after SCI. The results of this study provide for the first time evidence that intensive WBV-therapy leads to a significantly denser capillary network in the lesioned spinal cord. However, since this higher capillary density is not associated with improved functional recovery (possibly because it exceeded the balance necessary for functional improvements), optional treatments with lower intensity or less time of WBV-therapy should be tested.","isoflurane","pubmed"

ISMS within the cervical and lumbar spinal cord is capable of evoking a variety of highly-functional movements prior to injury, but the ability of ISMS to evoke forelimb movements after cervical spinal cord injury is unknown. Here we examine the forelimb movements and muscles activated by cervical ISMS both before and after contusion injury. We documented the forelimb muscles activated and movements evoked via systematic stimulation of the rodent cervical spinal cord both before injury and three, six and nine weeks following a moderate C4/C5 lateralized contusion injury. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane to permit construction of somatotopic maps of evoked movements and quantify evoked muscle synergies between cervical segments C3 and T1. When ISMS was delivered to the cervical spinal cord, a variety of responses were observed at 68% of locations tested, with a spatial distribution that generally corresponded to the location of motor neuron pools. Stimulus currents required to achieve movement and the number of sites where movements could be evoked were unchanged by spinal cord injury. A transient shift toward extension-dominated movements and restricted muscle synergies were observed at three and six weeks following injury, respectively. By nine weeks after injury, however, ISMS-evoked patterns were similar to spinally-intact animals. The results demonstrate the potential for cervical ISMS to reanimate hand and arm function following spinal cord injury. Robust forelimb movements can be evoked both before and during the chronic stages of recovery from a clinically relevant and sustained cervical contusion injury.","isoflurane","pubmed"

This is the first study to show how two commonly used anesthetics affect continuously recorded hemodynamic parameters and locomotor recovery during a 2-week period after two levels of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We hypothesized that the level of cardiovascular depression and recovery of locomotor function would be dependent upon the anesthetic used during SCI. Thirty-two adult female rats were subjected to a sham, 25-mm or 50-mm SCI at T3-4 under pentobarbital or isoflurane anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were telemetrically recorded before, during, and after SCI. Locomotor function recovered best in the 25-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. There was no significant difference in locomotor recovery between the 25-mm-injured pentobarbital-anesthetized animals and the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. White matter sparing and extent of intermediolateral cell column loss appeared larger in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, but this was not significant. There were no differential effects of anesthetics on HR and MAP before SCI, but recovery from anesthesia was significantly slower in pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. At the time of SCI, MAP was acutely elevated in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, whereas MAP decreased in the isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Hypotension occurred in the pentobarbital-anesthetized groups and in the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized group. In pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, SCI resulted in acute elevation of HR, although HR remained low. Return of HR to baseline was much slower in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. Severe SCI at T3 produced significant chronic tachycardia that was injury severity dependent. Although some laboratories monitor blood pressure, HR, and other physiological variables during surgery for SCI, inherently few have monitored cardiovascular function during recovery. This study shows that anesthetics affect hemodynamic parameters differently, which in turn can affect functional outcome measures. This supports the need for a careful evaluation of cardiovascular and other physiological measures in experimental models of SCI. Choice of anesthetic should be an important consideration in experimental designs and data analyses.","isoflurane","pubmed"

Exogenous acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is metabolized in the brain to acetyl coenzyme A and subsequently enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. ALCAR administration is neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury, but has not been tested for TBI. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with ALCAR during the first 24 h following TBI in immature rats improves neurologic outcome and reduces cortical lesion volume. Postnatal day 21-22 male rats were isoflurane anesthetized and used in a controlled cortical impact model of TBI to the left parietal cortex. At 1, 4, 12 and 23 h after injury, rats received ALCAR (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or drug vehicle (normal saline). On days 3-7 after surgery, behavior was assessed using beam walking and novel object recognition tests. On day 7, rats were transcardially perfused and brains were harvested for histological assessment of cortical lesion volume, using stereology. Injured animals displayed a significant increase in foot slips compared to sham-operated rats (6 ± 1 SEM vs. 2 ± 0.2 on day 3 after trauma; n = 7; p < 0.05). The ALCAR-treated rats were not different from shams and had fewer foot slips compared to vehicle-treated animals (2 ± 0.4; n = 7; p< 0.05). The frequency of investigating a novel object for saline-treated TBI animals was reduced compared to shams (45 ± 5% vs. 65 ± 10%; n = 7; p < 0.05), whereas the frequency of investigation for TBI rats treated with ALCAR was not significantly different from that of shams but significantly higher than that of saline-treated TBI rats (68 ± 7; p < 0.05). The left parietal cortical lesion volume, expressed as a percentage of the volume of tissue in the right hemisphere, was significantly smaller in ALCAR-treated than in vehicle-treated TBI rats (14 ± 5% vs. 28 ± 6%; p < 0.05).

Open-field locomotion and sensory function were assessed and animals were perfusion-fixed at twelve weeks after injury for quantitative histopathological analysis. As compared to 1B7, 217L treated animals showed an overall non-significant trend to better motor recovery. All animals showed chronic mechanical allodynia and anti-CD11d mAb treatment did not significantly prevent its development. Histopathological analysis demonstrated severe injury to gray and white matter after compression with a non-significant trend in anti-CD11d protection compared to control animals for preserved myelin. Although positive effects with the anti-CD11d mAb treatment have been reported after compressive SCI, it is suggested that this potential treatment requires further investigation before clinical trials in spinal cord injured patients are implemented.","isoflurane","pubmed"

The volume of urine retained in the bladder was measured daily for fourteen days post injury by anesthetizing the animals with isoflurane, expressing the bladder, and weighing the urine. To compare bladder deficits with the degree of impairment of hindlimb motor function, locomotion was assessed using the BBB open field rating scale. Rats with contusions at T4 and T9 exhibited bladder impairments reflected by increased urine retention from 1 to 12 days post injury. In contrast, rats with contusions at T1 exhibited minimal deficits (smaller volumes of retained urine). Lesion size and overall functional impairment were comparable between groups based on quantitative assessments of lesion area at the epicenter and BBB locomotor scores. Moreover, a sector analysis of sparing of different portions of the white matter revealed no differences in sparing of different funiculi between the groups. Injections of Fluorogold into lumbar segments led to retrograde labeling of a larger number of neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC) following T1 injury when compared to T4 or T9. Thus, moderate contusion lesions at T1 spare a critical descending pathway able to mediate at least reflex voiding in rats.","isoflurane","pubmed"

In a series of animals, locomotor recovery was assessed with the Basso mouse scale (BMS) for 6 weeks, and histological analyses was performed to determine tissue preservation. Lesion volume showed no significant differences between KO and WT mice at 24 h. RT-PCR indicated that KO mice had significantly less Bcl-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 mRNA compared with WT controls. Western blot also showed that KO had significantly less Bcl-2 7 d after spinal cord injury. KO mice had significantly worse BMS locomotor scores than WT at 6 weeks. KO mice also had a significantly reduced area of spared white matter and fewer neuronal-specific nuclear protein-positive neurons in the spinal cord surrounding the impact site.

The authors determined the isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) necessary to block movement in response to supramaximal noxious stimulation, as well as tail-flick and hind paw withdrawal latencies, before and up to 28 days after thoracic spinal transection. Tail-flick and hind paw withdrawal latencies were measured in the awake state to test for the presence of spinal shock or hyperreflexia. The authors measured limb forces elicited by noxious mechanical stimulation of a paw or the tail at 28 days after transection. Limb force experiments were also conducted in other animals that received a reversible spinal conduction block by cooling the spinal cord at the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra. A large decrease in MAC (to </= 40% of pretransection values) occurred after spinal transection, with partial recovery (to approximately 60% of control) at 14-28 days after transection. Awake tail-flick and hind paw withdrawal latencies were facilitated or unchanged, whereas reflex latencies under isoflurane were depressed or absent. However, at 80-90% of MAC, noxious stimulation of the hind paw elicited ipsilateral limb withdrawals in all animals. Hind limb forces were reduced (by >/= 90%) in both chronic and acute cold-block spinal animals. The immobilizing potency of isoflurane increases substantially after spinal transection, despite the absence of a baseline motor depression, or ""spinal shock."" Therefore, isoflurane MAC is determined by a spinal depressant action, possibly counteracted by a supraspinal facilitatory action. The partial recovery in MAC at later time points suggests that neuronal plasticity after spinal cord injury influences anesthetic requirements.","isoflurane","pubmed"

Because opioids are used in clinical anesthesia, the effect of an opiate antagonist was evaluated on neurologic outcome in a rat model of spinal cord injury occurring during opioid anesthesia. One day prior to spinal cord injury, a catheter was inserted into the spinal subarachnoid space with the tip at T8. On the day of spinal cord injury a balloon tipped catheter was inserted in the epidural space with the tip at the thoracolumbar junction. Spinal cord injury was produced by balloon inflation during one of the following states: 1) group 1 (A/S), injury was produced in awake rats and saline was administered in the subarachnoid space immediately following injury; 2) group 2 (F/S), injury was produced during a fentanyl/nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthetic, and subarachnoid saline administered; and 3) group 3 (F/Nx), injury was produced during a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, and subarachnoid naloxone (1 mg/kg) was administered immediately following injury. Dose-response curves describing the relationship between the duration of balloon inflation and the percentage of animals with a persistent neurologic deficit were constructed and compared for differences by use of a group t test. The duration of balloon inflation required to produce a neurologic deficit was greater in both the F/S and F/Nx groups than in the A/S group (P less than 0.05). There was no difference between the F/S and F/Nx groups. In summary, in rats receiving a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, neurologic outcome was improved compared with the awake state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","isoflurane","pubmed"

Increased work of breathing, mechanical disadvantage, neuromuscular disease, impaired nutritional status, shock, hypoxemia, acidosis, and deficiency of potassium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphorus are the major non-neurologic factors which contribute to respiratory muscle fatigue and failure. Respiratory muscle fatigue has two components. High frequency fatigue occurs rapidly with intense contractile efforts but is usually not severe. It also recovers rapidly with rest. Low frequency fatigue develops more slowly but is severe and requires hours for recovery. Since the spontaneous rate of neural stimulation is predominantly in the low frequency range, this component of fatigue is of particular clinical importance. Fatigue of the inspiratory muscles leads to acute respiratory acidosis, but before carbon dioxide retention occurs, it can be recognized from characteristic symptoms and signs. These include dyspnea which responds to mechanical ventilation, rapid shallow breathing, and asynchronous movements of the chest and abdomen. Inspiratory muscle fatigue must be treated by putting these muscles to rest, by mechanically supporting ventilation. In addition, underlying metabolic nutritional and circulatory abnormalities must be corrected and infection treated. Aminophylline and isoproterenol can restore inspiratory muscle contractility, but controlled clinical trials remain to be done regarding their application in acute and chronic respiratory failure. Inspiratory muscle training improves strength and endurance in patients with obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord injury, but does not always improve physical exercise performance. Again, more work is needed to develop the indications for inspiratory muscle training and to determine the optimum type and duration of the training regimen.","isoproterenol","pubmed"

However, most previous studies were performed under anesthesia, which significantly alters respiratory network. Therefore, the goal of this work was to assess spontaneous diaphragm recovery post-C2Hx in awake, freely behaving animals. Adult rats were chronically implanted with diaphragm EMG electrodes and recorded during 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Our results reveal that ipsilateral diaphragm activity partially recovers within days post-injury and reaches pre-injury amplitude in a few weeks. However, the full extent of spontaneous ipsilateral recovery is significantly attenuated by anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane). This suggests that the observed recovery may be attributed in part to activation of NMDA receptors which are suppressed by anesthesia. Despite spontaneous recovery in awake animals, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm dysfunction still persists: i) Inspiratory bursts during basal (slow) breathing exhibit an altered pattern, ii) the amplitude of sighs - or augmented breaths - is significantly decreased, and iii) the injured hemidiaphragm exhibits spontaneous events of hyperexcitation. The results from this study offer an under-appreciated insight into spontaneous diaphragm activity and recovery following high cervical spinal cord injury in awake animals.","ketamine","pubmed"

UA, a plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid, is well known for its multiple biological functions, including neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we evaluated its functions in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying its positive effects. Oral administration of UA to mice 1 h after SCI and thereafter once daily for 6 weeks enhanced the regaining of motor functions and axonal regrowth, and decreased astrogliosis. UA administration decreased levels of proinflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, in the injured spinal cord at the acute phase of inflammation and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways in the injured spinal cord.

Thirty albino Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups of 10 each: the sham-operated control group (group 1), the spinal cord trauma group (group 2), and the spinal cord trauma plus AK 295 treatment group (group 3). After having received a combination of ketamine 60 mg/kg and xylazine 9 mg/kg to induce anesthesia, the rats in groups 2 and 3 were subjected to thoracic trauma by the weight drop technique (40 g-cm). One hour after having been subjected to that trauma, the rats in groups 2 and 3 were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of either dimethyl sulfoxide 2 mg/kg or AK 295 2 mg/kg. The effects of the injury and the efficacy of AK 295 were determined by an assessment of the TUNEL technique and the results of examination with a light microscope. The neurologic performance of 5 rats from group 2 and 5 from group 3 was assessed by means of the inclined plane technique and the modified Tarlov's motor grading scale 1, 3, and 5 days after spinal cord trauma. Light-microscopic examination of spinal cord specimens from group 2 revealed hemorrhage, edema, necrosis, and vascular thrombi 24 hours after trauma. Similar (but less prominent) features were seen in specimens obtained from group 3 rats. Twenty-four hours after injury, the mean apoptotic cell numbers in groups 1 and 2 were zero and 4.57 +/- 0.37 cells, respectively. In group 3, the mean apoptotic cell number was 2.30 +/- 0.34 cells, a value significantly lower than that in group 2 (P < .05). Five days after trauma, the injured rats in group 2 demonstrated significant motor dysfunction (P < .05). In comparison, the motor scores exhibited by group 3 rats were markedly better (P < .05). AK 295 inhibited apoptosis via calpaindependent pathways and provided neuroprotection and improved neurologic function in a rat model of SCI. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the use of AK 295, a calpain inhibitor, after SCI.

The use of agmatine [4-(aminobutyl)-guanidine-NH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(-NH2)(=NH)], a guanidinium compound formed by decarboxylation of L-arginine by arginine decarboxylase, is a neurotransmitter-neuromodulator with both N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antagonizing and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-inhibiting activities. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the dose-dependent activity of agmatine, an inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor and selective NMDAR antagonist, on biochemical and functional recovery in an experimental rat SCI model. This study involved 40 Wistar albino male rats. The rats were subjected to sleep-awake cycles for 7 days before surgery. In each group, general anesthesia was induced by a 60-mg/kg ketamine injection. For the surgical SCI model, a Yaşargil aneurysm clip was placed in the spinal cord. The study was conducted in the following four main groups: Group I (control group) laminectomy only; Group II, trauma-only group and SCI; Group III, laminectomy, SCI and agmatine 50 mg/kg for 10 days; and Group IV, laminectomy, SCI, and agmatine 100 mg/kg for 10 days. On Day 1, no statistical difference was observed in any group (p < 0.005, analysis of variance [ANOVA] and the Fisher protected least significant difference [PLSD]). On Day 2, no statistical difference was noted among Groups II, III, and IV (p = 0.27, p = 0.42, and p = 0.76, respectively; ANOVA and Fisher PLSD). Beginning on Day 3, recovery in Groups III and IV differed significantly from that in Group II (p < 0.005, ANOVA and Fisher PLSD), and a statistically significant difference between Groups III and IV was observed, which also was present on Days 5, 7, and 10 (p = 0.003, p = 0.0024, and p = 0.0036, respectively; ANOVA and Fisher PLSD). Several observations were noteworthy: motor function scores were reduced significantly in the spinal cord-injured rats compared with the controls (p < 0.005); on Day 1, the agreement of motor function scores in rats in each SCI group indicated that the traumatic event had been replicated equally across all groups (p = 0.59, p = 0.59, and p = 0.28); a statistically significant difference in motor function scores developed on Day 3 between the rats subjected to trauma alone (Group II) and those treated with agmatine (Groups III and IV) (p < 0.005); and no statistically significant intergroup difference in motor function existed at any postinjury interval between the 50- and 100-mg/kg/day agmatine-treated rats (p > 0.005). Agmatine administration following SCI was shown to reduce NO levels significantly. No statistically significant intergroup difference in the reduction of NO levels was found between rats treated with 50- and 100-mg/kg/day doses of agmatine. Administration of a 100-mg/kg/day dose of agmatine reduced the NO levels to those measured in controls. The authors conclude that with additional studies into the role of agmatine, this drug may be helpful in the treatment of patients with SCIs.","ketamine","pubmed"

Myogenic TMS-MEPs was very sensitive to the spinal cord injury and should be a valid technique for intraoperative monitoring, and a slight change of them, even if a transient lose, should be unnecessarily related to a severe movement disorder.

New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and instrumented for systemic blood pressure monitoring and spinal cord blood flow measurements using the microsphere method. After pretreatment with flunarizine or vehicle, ischemic spinal cord injury was created selectively in the caudal regions of the spinal cord by cross-clamping the abdominal aorta for a period of 25 minutes. Spinal cord blood flow was measured before, during, and 15 minutes after cross-clamp removal. Animals were allowed to recover and were graded neurologically at 18 and 24 hours after ischemia. Flunarizine injection was associated with hypotension that was both transient and dose related. Animals pretreated with flunarizine 0.4 mg/kg had significantly improved neurological recovery scores at 18 hours after ischemia (P = .017) compared with vehicle controls. At 24 hours this effect was lessened (P = .095); however, 60% of flunarizine-treated animals retained their ability to hop, whereas all of the vehicle-treated animals were nonambulatory. Flunarizine has a protective effect on neurological recovery after experimental ischemic spinal cord injury. The therapeutic window is narrow, and dosing is limited by untoward hypotension. The mechanism of protection likely involves inhibition of pathological cytosolic calcium accumulation rather than a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle.","ketamine","pubmed"

SSEPs were cortically recorded and CMEPs were transcortically produced using epidural ball and disc electrodes. SSEPs were elicited and CMEPs were recorded via hindlimb percutaneous needle electrodes. After control records, animals were subjected to a 50-g/cm impact to the dorsal cord surface using a modified weight drop technique. Evaluation of neurological injury was performed by SSEP and CMEP analysis and was compared with neurological assessments obtained before injury and 1 hour, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after injury. Neurohistopathological verification of each spinal cord lesion was performed at 6 weeks after injury. Animals subjected to a 50-g/cm cord impact showed no change in SSEP wave forms, but all components of the CMEP were greatly attenuated with this injury. Acutely, either very weak movement or no movement to noxious stimulation was present without vocalization. There was a spectrum of clinical recovery that correlated closely with the return and normalization of the amplitude of the CMEP in 100% of the animals tested. The eventual degree of clinical and CMEP improvement correlated well with the degree of histological damage present. The results of this study suggest that the CMEP is a reliable indicator of the initial degree of loss of neurological motor function in acute blunt spinal cord injury in the rat, as well as an accurate measure of the degree and extent of recovery. The rat model as outlined here is a simple and inexpensive system for evaluation both clinically and electrophysiologically of the degree of motor recovery from spinal cord injury. This model should prove useful in the evaluation of promising pharmacological agents for potential use in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.","ketamine","pubmed"

One group was treated with crocin (150mg/kg) two weeks after spinal cord injury; the second group, control, was treated with vehicle only; and the third group was treated with ketoprofen. Two normal groups were also considered with or without crocin treatment. The mechanical behavioral test, the locomotor recovery test and the thermal behavioral test were applied weekly to evaluate the injury and recovery of rats. Significant improvements (p<0.05) in mechanical behavioral and locomotor recovery tests were seen in the rats treated with crocin. Thermal behavioral test did not show any significant changes due to crocin treatment. Plasma concentration of calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) changed from 780.2±2.3 to 1140.3±4.5pg/ml due to SCI and reached 789.1±2.7pg/ml after crocin treatment. These changes were significant at the level of p<0.05. The present study shows the beneficial effects of crocin treatment on chronic pain induced by SCI, through decreasing CGRP as an important mediator of inflammation and pain.","ketoprofen","pubmed"

Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC(50) of 2 μM. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 μM BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K(d) = 170 μM) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K(d) = 5 μM) and even more tightly (K(d) = 0.2 μM) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 μM. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels.","lacosamide","pubmed"

The neuroprotective effects of melatonin in SCI models have been reported; however, it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of melatonin are associated with alleviation of gut dysbiosis. In this study, we showed that daily intraperitoneal injection with melatonin following spinal cord contusion at thoracic level 10 in mice improved intestinal barrier integrity and GI motility, reduced expression levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, improved animal weight gain and metabolic profiling, and promoted locomotor recovery. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed that melatonin treatment decreased the Shannon index and reshaped the composition of intestinal microbiota. Melatonin-treated SCI animals showed decreased relative abundance of Clostridiales and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillales and Lactobacillus, which correlated with alteration of cytokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) expression and GI barrier permeability, as well as with locomotor recovery. Experimental induction of gut dysbiosis in mice before SCI (i.e., by oral delivery of broad-spectrum antibiotics) exacerbates neurological impairment after SCI, and melatonin treatment improves locomotor performance and intestinal integrity in antibiotic-treated SCI mice. The results suggest that melatonin treatment restores SCI-induced alteration in gut microbiota composition, which may underlie the ameliorated GI function and behavioral manifestations.","lactobacillus","pubmed"

Aim of the Study: This study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of methylprednisolone and levetiracetam on SCI. Materials and Methods: In this study, 42 male Wistar Albino rats, each weighing 300-350 g, were separated into three main groups: control group, acute and subacute stage groups. With the exception of the control group, a T7-8 dorsal laminectomy was performed on the spinal column of the rats. A temporary vascular aneurysm clip was then applied to the spinal cord for 1 min to create SCI and methylprednisolone or levetiracetam was administered intraperitoneally to all except the control and SHAM control groups. The damaged spinal cord was removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. Results: Both pharmacological agents were determined to have improved the histopathological architecture in damaged neural tissues during the acute period of SCI, but could not sustain this activity in the subacute period. Neither pharmacological agent affected the biochemical data in the acute nor subacute stages. Conclusions: Both pharmacological agents showed histopathological healing effects in injured tissues during the acute phase of SCI in this rat model but these effects could not be sustained in the subacute period. No effect on biochemical data was seen in either the acute or subacute period.

We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.","levodopa","pubmed"

They then evaluated the effects of 8 weeks of treadmill training in Tx mice that received BCD or BCD + clenbuterol, a monoaminergic agent with anabolic properties, on locomotor function, muscle atrophy, adipose tissue loss, and bone density measures. Induced locomotor movement, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and femoral bone properties were compared in unoperated control mice, operated controls (untreated, untrained Tx mice), and 2 groups of treated, trained Tx mice (Tx + BCD, Tx + BCD + clenbuterol) that also received training. BCD- and BCD + clenbuterol-treated mice showed comparable levels of locomotor movements that significantly improved over time.

However, only partial central network-activating effects were found with single molecules since none administered separately could elicit weight-bearing and functional stepping movements in Tx animals. In turn, a recent breakthrough revealed that full spinal locomotor network-activating effects may be induced with synergistic drug combinations. Indeed, specific cocktails comprising some of these agonists and precursors were found, indeed, to powerfully generate weight-bearing stepping with plantar foot placement in untrained, non-assisted and non-sensory-stimulated Tx mice.

We assessed the quality of locomotion of spinally transected eels from measurements made from video recordings of individuals swimming at different speeds in a water tunnel. Following transection of the spinal cord just caudal to the anus, the animals displayed higher tail beat frequencies and lower tail beat amplitudes than before surgery, owing to the loss of power in this region. Swimming performance then progressively recovered, appearing normal within 1 month of surgery. Eels with similar transections, but given regular, repeated intraperitoneal injections (50 mg/kg) of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) showed an equivalent pattern of decline and recovery that was 10-20 days shorter than that seen in non-treated fish. Axonal growth into the denervated cord, as determined from anterograde labelling experiments, was also more rapid in the drug-treated fish. L-DOPA treatment increased the activity of all fish for up to 18 h, and accelerated the spontaneous movements ('spinal swimming') made by the denervated, caudal portion of the animal that appeared following transection.

Nociceptive stimulation increased the extent of hemorrhage. Lidocaine applied at T2 before, but not immediately after, stimulation blocked this effect.

Neurophysiological and neuroprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A novel implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system enables targeted drug delivery and induction of temporary paraplegia in awake, behaving nonhuman primates.

In a clinically relevant spinal cord contusion injury model, prior work has shown that noxious stimulation at an intensity that engages pain (C) fibers soon after injury augments secondary injury and impairs functional recovery. Noxious input increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β and 18), cellular signals associated with cell death (caspase 3 and 8), and physiological signs of hemorrhage. Here, it is shown that reducing neural excitability after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the local anesthetic lidocaine (micro-injected by means of a lumbar puncture) blocks these adverse cellular effects. In contrast, treatment with an analgesic dose of morphine had no effect. Contused rats that received nociceptive stimulation soon after injury exhibited poor locomotor recovery, less weight gain, and greater tissue loss at the site of injury.

Recent findings are reviewed that show SCI places the caudal tissue in a vulnerable state that exaggerates the effects nociceptive stimuli and promotes the development of nociceptive sensitization. Stimulation that is both unpredictable and uncontrollable induces a form of maladaptive plasticity that enhances nociceptive sensitization and impairs spinally mediated learning. In contrast, relational learning induces a form of adaptive plasticity that counters these adverse effects. SCI sets the stage for nociceptive sensitization by disrupting serotonergic (5HT) fibers that quell overexcitation. The loss of 5HT can enhance neural excitability by reducing membrane-bound K+-Cl- cotransporter 2, a cotransporter that regulates the outward flow of Cl-. This increases the intracellular concentration of Cl-, which reduces the hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Uncontrollable noxious stimulation also undermines the recovery of locomotor function, and increases behavioral signs of chronic pain, after a contusion injury. Nociceptive stimulation has a greater effect if experienced soon after SCI. This adverse effect has been linked to a downregulation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an upregulation in the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor. Noxious input enhances tissue loss at the site of injury by increasing the extent of hemorrhage and apoptotic/pyroptotic cell death. Intrathecal lidocaine blocks nociception-induced hemorrhage, cellular indices of cell death, and its adverse effect on behavioral recovery. Clinical implications are discussed.","lidocaine","pubmed"

There was essentially no return of the SER in the five untreated animals when monitored for 4 hours post-injury. All of the pathological specimens from these animals revealed severe central cord hemorrhage. Intravenous lidocaine was begun 15 minutes after the injury in five animals.

Therefore, a reliable prediction of the improvement in the acute phase could benefit patients. Physicians are unanimous in insisting that at the initial damage of the spinal cord (SC), the patient should be carefully evaluated in order to help selecting an appropriate neuroprotective treatment. However, currently, neurologic impairment after SCI is measured and classified by functional examination. The identification of prognostic biomarkers of SCI would help to designate SC injured patients and correlate to diagnosis and correct treatment. Some proteins have already been identified as good potential biomarkers of central nervous system injury, both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum. However, the problem for using them as biomarkers is the way they should be collected, as acquiring CSF through a lumbar puncture is significantly invasive. Remarkably, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as interesting biomarker candidates because of their stability in biological fluids and their tissue specificity. Several miRNAs have been identified to have their expressions altered in SCI in many animal models, making them promising candidates as biomarkers after SCI. Moreover, there are yet no effective therapies for SCI. It is already known that altered lysophospholipids (LPs) signaling are involved in the biology of disorders, such as inflammation. Reports have demonstrated that LPs when locally distributed can regulate SCI repair and key secondary injury processes such as apoptosis and inflammation, and so could become in the future new therapeutic approaches for treating SCI.","lipids","pubmed"

Longitudinal study. Community-based supervised intervention. Participants (N=17) comprised individuals with SCI (n=9) who volunteered for this study, and able-bodied individuals (n=8) matched for age, height, and body mass index who were assessed at baseline only. The arm-cranking exercise program was performed for 10 weeks with 4 sessions per week. Sessions consisted of 2 sets of warmup (5min) and arm crank exercises (25min) with a 10-minute recovery at an intensity of 50% to 70% of heart rate reserve. Body mass (BM), waist circumference (WC), aerobic capacity (peak oxygen consumption [Vo2peak]), PAI-1, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and lipids. PAI-1, BM, WC, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides (TG) decreased, and Vo2peak increased after training (P<.05, respectively). Spearman rank-order analysis revealed that changes in PAI-1 were related to changes in Vo2peak, BM, WC, TG, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that WC was the most sensitive factor for predicting changes in PAI-1 (P=.038). These results suggest that 10 weeks of arm-cranking exercise training for people with SCI may help to reduce the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In addition, changes in abdominal fat may be related to changes in PAI-1 in the SCI population.","lipids","pubmed"

We have previously demonstrated that infiltrated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) engulf myelin debris, forming myelin-laden macrophages (mye-Mϕ). These mye-Mϕ promote disease progression through their pro-inflammatory phenotype, enhanced neurotoxicity, and impaired phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells. We thus hypothesize that the excessive accumulation of mye-Mϕ is the root of secondary injury, and that targeting mye-Mϕ represents an efficient strategy to improve the local inflammatory microenvironment in injured spinal cords and to further motor neuron function recovery. In this study, we administer murine embryonic stem cell conditioned media (ESC-M) as a cell-free stem cell based therapy to treat a mouse model of SCI. We showed that BMDMs, but not microglial cells, engulf myelin debris generated at the injury site. Phagocytosis of myelin debris leads to the formation of mye-Mϕ in the injured spinal cord, which are surrounded by activated microglia cells. These mye-Mϕ are pro-inflammatory and lose the normal macrophage phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells. We therefore focus on how to trigger lipid efflux from mye-Mϕ and thus restore their function. Using ESC-M as an immune modulating treatment for inflammatory damage after SCI, we rescued mye-Mϕ function and improved functional locomotor recovery. ESC-M treatment on mye-Mϕ resulted in improved exocytosis of internalized lipids and a normal capacity for apoptotic cell phagocytosis. Furthermore, when ESC-M was administered intraperitoneally after SCI, animals exhibited significant improvements in locomotor recovery. Examination of spinal cords of the ESC-M treated mice revealed similar improvements in macrophage function as well as a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory environment at the lesion and parenchyma. The embryonic stem cell conditioned media can be used as an effective treatment for SCI to resolve inflammation and improve functional recovery while circumventing the complications involved in whole cell transplantation.","lipids","pubmed"

Certain conserved sequential and structural patterns of interacting residues specifically bind to PEGs. It is also found that PEG600, PEG400 and PEG200 share the strongest interaction with the lipid-binding domains even more successful than phospholipid head groups. The alpha helix structure composed of hydrophobic, neutral and acidic residues prepares an opportunity for PEG400 to play an amphipathic role in the interaction with injured membrane.

In the present study, we examined the role of autophagy, inhibited by 3-MA and enhanced by rapamycin, in a model of acute spinal cord injury in rats. We found that rapamycin could significantly increase the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin1 at the injury site. At the same time, the number of neurons and astrocytes with LC3 positive in the spinal cord was upregulated with time. In addition, administration of rapamycin produced an increase in the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scores of injured rats, indicating high recovery of locomotor function. Furthermore, expression of the proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was upregulated and downregulated, respectively. By contrast, the results for rats treated with 3-MA, which inhibits autophagy, were the opposite of those seen with the rapamycin-treated rats.

Usually, lithium is used as a popular mood stabilizer. Recently, growing evidence has shown that lithium has clear neuroprotective effects after SCI, and the administration of lithium can effectively improve locomotor recovery. However, the exact neuroprotective mechanism of lithium is still not understood. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the neuroprotective effects of lithium both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we discovered that lithium inhibits GSK3β activity through two different signaling pathways in spinal cord neurons. In the acute phase, lithium inhibited GSK3β activity by stimulating phosphorylation of AKT; in the chronic phase, we first discovered that lithium additionally upregulated the expression of Na+, K+-ATPase α1 (NKA α1), which had an inhibitory effect on GSK3β activity by inducing the expression of glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 is well known as a regulator of the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, the suppressed activity of GSK3β increased the level of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which gave rise to the translocation of the freely stabilized β-catenin to the nucleus. In addition, the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus had the benefits of neuronal survival. Hopefully our findings from this study are beneficial in revealing the neuroprotective mechanism of lithium and in offering novel targets for the development of new SCI therapeutic drugs.","lithium","pubmed"

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of the balance between growth, proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of EA therapy on Wnt/β‑catenin‑regulated gene expression and neuronal recovery in rats with SCI. The Allen method was used to establish SCI in rats, and alterations in Wnt1 and Nestin mRNA and protein expression levels in response to SCI were determined on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post‑injury using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. To evaluate the effects of EA treatment on SCI, the following four treatment groups were employed: SCI, SCI + EA, SCI + lithium chloride (LiCl) and SCI + LiCl + EA. The protein expression levels of Wnt1, Nestin and nuclear β‑catenin were evaluated on day 3 post‑treatment, and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) protein expression levels were evaluated on day 21 post‑treatment using western blot analysis. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scoring method was used to evaluate spinal cord recovery on day 28 post‑treatment across the four treatment groups. EA therapy at the Dazhui and Mingmen acupuncture points significantly increased the expression levels of Wnt1, Nestin, β‑catenin and NeuN, thus suggesting that EA therapy may promote spinal cord recovery following injury. The underlying mechanism was demonstrated to involve enhanced Wnt/β‑catenin signaling, which may promote the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. However, further studies are required to elucidate the detailed effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of EA therapy on SCI.","lithium","pubmed"

On days 1 and 3 and the last days of the following weeks postoperatively, the motor function of the hindlimb of the rats were evaluated according to the BBB scores. At 8 weeks, all the rats were sacrificed and the spinal cords were taken for morphological observation. The spinal cord tissues at the injury site were observed with Brdu nuclear labeling to identify the survival and migration of the transplanted SCs. The regeneration and distribution of the spinal nerve fibers were observed with fluorescent-gold (FG) spinal cord retrograde tracing. Brdu labeling showed that the transplanted hUCB-SCs survived and migrated in the spinal cord 8 weeks postoperatively in groups C and D. FG retrograde tracing identified a small amount of pyramidal cells that migrated across the injury site in groups C and D.

The effect of a GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl), on the regeneration of axotomized RST neurons was also assessed. Adult rats received a unilateral hemisection at the seventh cervical spinal cord segment (C7). Four weeks after different treatments, regeneration of RST axons across the lesion scar was examined by injection of Fluoro-Gold at spinal segment T2, and locomotor recovery was studied by a test of forelimb usage. Injured RST axons did not regenerate spontaneously after spinal cord injury, and intraperitoneal injection of LiCl alone did not promote the regeneration of RST axons. Administration of ChABC at the lesion site enhanced the regeneration of RST axons by 20%. Combined treatment of LiCl together with ChABC significantly increased the regeneration of RST axons to 42%. Animals receiving combined treatment used both forelimbs together more often than animals that received sham or single treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LiCl induced the expression of inactive GSK-3beta as well as the upregulation of Bcl-2 in injured RST neurons. These results indicate that in vivo, LiCl inhibits GSK-3beta and reinforces the regeneration-promoting function of ChABC through a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism.

As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we aimed to investigate if their neuroprotective efficacy could be cumulative. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of combined administration of riluzole and magnesium chloride in a contusive model of thoracic spinal cord injury. An in vivo experiment was set using female Wistar Han rats that underwent a thoracic spinal cord contusion (T8) using a weight drop method. An hour after injury, animals were randomly distributed to receive (1) saline, (2) riluzole (2.50 mg/kg), (3) magnesium chloride (24.18 mg/kg) in a polyethylene glycol formulation, or (4) a combined treatment (riluzole and magnesium). Subsequent treatments were given in four intraperitoneal injections (spaced 12 hours apart). The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, an activity box test, and a swimming test were used to evaluate behavioral recovery over a 4-week period. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords was performed to measure the extent and volume of the lesion, axonal preservation, serotonergic and glutamatergic fiber sparing, motor neuron survival, and inflammation. Our results show that only the riluzole treatment significantly improved behavioral recovery up to 4 weeks after injury when compared with saline controls (6.2±1.8), with animals achieving weight-supported stepping (9.1±1.2). Riluzole also promoted tissue sparing with significant differences achieved from 200 to 600 µm (caudally to the lesion epicenter), and reduced lesion volume, with animals presenting a significantly smaller lesion (3.23±0.26 mm(3)) when compared with the saline-treated group (4.74±0.80 mm(3)), representing a 32% decrease in lesion volume. Riluzole treatment induced significant axonal preservation, as well as serotonergic fiber sparing, caudally to the injury epicenter. Our results suggest that the combined treatment, although simultaneously targeting two excitotoxic-related mechanisms, did not further improve behavioral and histologic outcome when compared with riluzole given alone.","magnesium_chloride","pubmed"

Here, we used intravenous injection of endothelial-binding lectin followed by histology to show that the number of perfused microvessels at the injury site is decreased by 80-90% as early as 20 min following a moderate T9 contusion in adult female rats. Hemorrhage within the spinal cord also was maximal at 20 min, consistent with its vasoconstrictive actions in the central nervous system (CNS). Microvascular blood flow recovered to up to 50% of normal volume in the injury penumbra by 6 h, but not at the epicenter. A comparison with an endothelial cell marker suggested that many microvessels fail to be reperfused up to 48 h post-injury. The ischemia was probably caused by vasospasm of vessels penetrating the parenchyma, because repeated Doppler measurements over the spinal cord showed a doubling of total blood flow over the first 12 h. Moreover, intravenous infusion of magnesium chloride, used clinically to treat CNS vasospasm, greatly improved the number of perfused microvessels at 24 and 48 h. The magnesium treatment seemed safe as it did not increase hemorrhage, despite the improved parenchymal blood flow. However, the treatment did not reduce acute microvessel, motor neuron or oligodendrocyte loss, and when infused for 7 days did not affect functional recovery or spared epicenter white matter over a 4 week period.

We have developed a novel formulation of magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) within PEG, and have previously demonstrated the neuroprotective benefit of this formulation in animal models of thoracic SCI. Twenty-two Sprague Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical hemicontusion at C4-C5 and were randomized 2 hours later to either the MgCl₂ in PEG formulation, or normal saline. Each treatment was administered in 5 intravenous infusions spaced 6 hours apart. Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks, after which the cord was analyzed to measure the extent of gray matter and white matter sparing through the injury site. In the horizontal ladder test, the percentage of forelimb errors made by the animals treated with MgCl₂ in PEG formulation was significantly lower than the saline-treated controls. Histologic analysis also revealed a significantly higher cumulative white matter sparing through the injury site in the MgCl₂ in PEG group. MgCl₂ in a PEG formulation reduced secondary damage and improved behavioral recovery when administered 2 hours after a unilateral cervical hemicontusion injury. These findings are consistent with the neurologic benefit observed when administering this magnesium formulation in contusive and compressive models of thoracic SCI. Demonstrating the robustness of this neuroprotective effect in multiple injury models (and in the cervical injury model in particular) is important when considering the applicability of such a therapy for human SCIs.","magnesium_chloride","pubmed"

Mean acetone drop test score and weight were significantly different in MgSO4, MP and combining MgSO4 and MP  treated groups compared with SCI+veh group (P<0.05). These findings revealed that MP, MgSO4 and combining MgSO4 and MP treatment can attenuate neuropathic pains following SCI in rats include: thermal hyperalgesia and cold allodynia.

Behavioral testing lasted for 6 weeks, followed by histological analysis of the spinal cord. Both PEG and MgSO(4) resulted in enhanced locomotor recovery and lower susceptibility to neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia) compared with saline. At 6 weeks, BBB scores were 7.3 +/- 0.2, 7.7 +/- 0.4, and 6.4 +/- 0.6 in PEG-treated, MgSO(4)-treated, and saline-treated control groups, respectively. Likewise, at 6 weeks PEG-, MgSO(4)-, and saline-treated control animals showed 3.5 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.9, and 5.0 +/- 0.5 avoidance responses to at-level touch, respectively. PEG + MgSO(4) improved locomotor recovery and reduced pain but did not provide additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. Neither treatment, nor their combination, attenuated mean arterial pressure (MAP) increases during autonomic dysreflexia. However, saline-treated controls had significantly lower resting MAP than PEG-treated rats and tended to have lower resting MAP than MgSO(4)-treated rats 6 weeks postinjury. MgSO(4) treatment and PEG + MgSO(4) treatment resulted in significant increases in dorsal myelin sparing, and the latter resulted in significant reductions in lesion volume, compared with saline-treated controls. Furthermore, mean lesion volumes correlated negatively with the corresponding mean BBB scores and positively with the corresponding mean pain scores.

As no useful treatment for post-SCI complications has been approved thus far, finding novel treatments is of great importance. Considering the promising effects of melatonin (MEL) against destructive mechanisms in other models of brain damage, in the current study we evaluated its ameliorative effects on sensory-motor outcomes, inflammatory mediators, histological changes and other post-SCI complications. Rats, in SCI and MEL groups, underwent laminectomy followed by a severe compression injury by an aneurysm clip. Then, intrathecal treatment with vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or MEL was carried out post-injury. Acetone drop, von Frey, inclined plane, and BBB tests as well as weight changes and auricle temperature, were used to evaluate the neuropathic pain, motor function, and other post-SCI complications. The effects of MEL on the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed using gelatin zymography method every week till day 28 post-SCI. Histopathological assessments were performed on days 14, 21, and 28. MEL treatment resulted in decreased motor dysfunction, mechanical and cold allodynia, auricle temperature, and also ameliorated weight loss. Moreover, MEL suppressed MMP-9 activity while increasing that of MMP-2 post-SCI indicating its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Also, MEL significantly preserved white matter myelinated areas and the number of sensory neurons post-SCI. The results suggest MEL as a promising candidate for medical therapies with advantageous effects on improving functional recovery through suppressing inflammatory mediators, and attenuating spinal tissue damages.","melatonin","pubmed"

However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of MT on SCI have not been elucidated. An experiment was performed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of MT on the neuronal autophagy after SCI and its effect on the recovery of nerve function. The rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: the SCI+MT+EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor), SCI+MT, SCI, and sham operation groups. On the 14th day after SCI, MT significantly promoted the recovery of motor function in the hind limbs according to the results of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores. At the same time, MT treatment resulted in reduced activation of cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive neurons and increased the survival of motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord on the 14th day after SCI, which exerted its neuroprotection. Furthermore, western blot and immunofluorescence double staining were performed to verify the molecular mechanism of effect of MT on SCI, and results showed the significantly upregulated expressions of Beclin-1, light chain-3B, SIRT1, p-AMPK proteins in the spinal cord tissue of MT-treated rats on the 14th day after SCI, however, the effect of MT on autophagy was reversed by EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor), which implied that MT activated autophagy via SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway after SCI. Similarly, the neuroprotective effects of MT on SCI were also inhibited after the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway was suppressed by EX527. Taken together, these results suggest that MT inhibits the apoptosis and activates autophagy of nerve cells after SCI and ultimately exerts the neuroprotective effect by SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway.","melatonin","pubmed"

Melatonin (MT), a hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, is associated with neuroprotective effects against SCI. Enhanced autophagy can promote the recovery of locomotor function and reduce apoptosis after SCI. Interestingly, MT increases autophagy in SCI in vivo. Nevertheless, the ability of MT to increase autophagy and decrease apoptosis, and the potential effects on the recovery of motor neurons in the anterior horn after SCI remain to be clarified. In this study, we discovered that MT treatment improved motor function recovery in a rat SCI model. Indeed, MT upregulated the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), while expression of protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was downregulated after SCI. Additionally, MT increased the expression of autophagy-activating proteins, while the expression of apoptosis-activating proteins in neurons was decreased following SCI. Furthermore, autophagy was inhibited, while apoptosis was induced in SCI model rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary neurons by treatment with MT, the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa). Collectively, our results suggest that MT can improve the recovery of locomotor function by enhancing autophagy as well as reducing apoptosis after SCI in rats, probably via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.","melatonin","pubmed"

Neuroinflammation exaggerates the secondary injury subsequent to trauma. Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin may help protect neural tissue against secondary injury after SCI, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Microglial/macrophages polarization plays an important role in regulating immune responses. To examine whether melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects after acute SCI by regulating microglial/macrophages polarization in the spinal cord, we administered intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (50 mg/kg) in female rats immediately after SCI and then daily for seven consecutive days (n = 6). Compared with the vehicle-treated group (n = 6), the melatonin-treated group exhibited a greater Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating score, smaller spinal cavity, and less cleaved caspase 3 immunofluorescence staining in the injured spinal segments. Real-time PCR data revealed decreases in the expression levels of M1 microglia phenotypic markers and increases in M2 markers in the spinal cord of melatonin-treated SCI rats, as compared to levels in the vehicle-treated group. Melatonin increased the number of CD206+ and Arg1+ cells, decreased the number of CD16+ and iNOS+ cells and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in the spinal cord tissue of female SCI rats. Current findings suggest that melatonin may inhibit pro-inflammatory responses and promote M2 polarization of microglial/macrophages in the spinal cord in the early stage of SCI, facilitating functional recovery. Accordingly, melatonin may represent a promising therapeutic candidate for acute SCI.","melatonin","pubmed"

The neuroprotective effects of melatonin in SCI models have been reported; however, it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of melatonin are associated with alleviation of gut dysbiosis. In this study, we showed that daily intraperitoneal injection with melatonin following spinal cord contusion at thoracic level 10 in mice improved intestinal barrier integrity and GI motility, reduced expression levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, improved animal weight gain and metabolic profiling, and promoted locomotor recovery. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed that melatonin treatment decreased the Shannon index and reshaped the composition of intestinal microbiota. Melatonin-treated SCI animals showed decreased relative abundance of Clostridiales and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillales and Lactobacillus, which correlated with alteration of cytokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) expression and GI barrier permeability, as well as with locomotor recovery. Experimental induction of gut dysbiosis in mice before SCI (i.e., by oral delivery of broad-spectrum antibiotics) exacerbates neurological impairment after SCI, and melatonin treatment improves locomotor performance and intestinal integrity in antibiotic-treated SCI mice.

Controlled light/dark cycle was pre-applied 2 weeks before induction of spinal cord injury. There was a significant increase in motor recovery as well as body weight from postoperative day (POD) 7 under constant darkness. However, spontaneous elevation of endogenous melatonin in cerebrospinal fluid was seen at POD 3 in all of the SCI rats, which was enhanced in SCI + DD group. Augmented melatonin concentration under constant dark condition resulted in facilitation of neuronal differentiation as well as inhibition of primary cell death. In the rostrocaudal region, elevated endogenous melatonin concentration promoted neural remodeling in acute phase including oligodendrogenesis, excitatory synaptic formation, and axonal outgrowth. The changes were mediated via NAS-TrkB-AKT/ERK signal transduction co-regulated by the circadian clock mechanism, leading to rapid motor recovery.

There is sufficient data suggesting that cranberry supplementation is ineffective for prevention of UTIs in individuals with SCI. There is insufficient data to support or refute the use of any other dietary supplement in individuals with SCI.","melatonin","pubmed"

Upregulation of reactive astrocyte under SCI pathological conditions has been presented in several studies. It has been proved that the crucial factor in triggering this upregulation is proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, scar formation is an important barrier to axonal regeneration through the lesion area. Melatonin plays an important role in reducing inflammation, but its effects on scar formation in the injured spinal cord remain unknown. Hence, we used the model of severe crush injury in mice to investigate the effects of melatonin on scar formation. Mice were randomly separated into four groups; SCI, SCI+Melatonin 1 (single dose), SCI+Melatonin 14 (14 daily doses), and control. Melatonin was administered by intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg) after injury. Immunohistochemical analysis, Western blot, and behavioral evaluation were used to explore the effects of melatonin after SCI for 14 days. The melatonin-treated mice presented higher expression of neuronal markers (P < 0.001). Remarkably, the inflammatory response appeared to be greatly reduced in the SCI+Melatonin 14 group (P < 0.001), which also displayed less scar formation (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that melatonin inhibits scar formation by acting on inflammatory cytokines after SCI. Overall, our results suggest that melatonin is a promising treatment strategy after SCI that deserves further investigation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","melatonin","pubmed"

Wnt signaling mediates major developmental processes during embryogenesis and regulates maintenance, self-renewal, and differentiation of adult mammalian stem cells. However, the role of the noncanonical Wnt pathway during neurogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, the amniotic epithelial cells ( AECs) were isolated from bovine amnion and incubated with various melatonin concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μm) and 5 × 10(-5) m all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for screening optimum culture medium of neural differentiation, compared with each groups, 1 μm melatonin and 5 × 10(-5) m RA were selected to induce neural differentiation of AECs, and then siMT1, siMT2, oWnt-4, and siWnt-4 were expressed in AECs to research role of these genes in neural differentiation. Efficiency of neural differentiation was evaluated after expressed above genes using flow cytometry. Cell function of neural cells was demonstrated in vivo using spinal cord injury model after cell transplantation, and damage repair of spinal cord was assessed using cell tracking and Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale scores. Results demonstrated that melatonin stimulated melatonin receptor 1, which subsequently increased bovine amniotic epithelial cell vitality and promoted differentiation into neural cells. This took place through cooperation with Wnt-4. Additionally, following cotreatment with melatonin and Wnt-4, neurogenesis gene expression was significantly altered. Furthermore, single inhibition of melatonin receptor 1 or Wnt-4 expression decreased expression of neurogenesis-related genes, and bovine amniotic epithelial cell-derived neural cells were successfully colonized into injured spinal cord, which suggested participation in tissue repair.","melatonin","pubmed"

Published MT studies in SCI animal models described in six databases were searched. Two practiced investigators selected the studies, extracted the data, and independently evaluated the quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis evaluated the effect of MT in SCI and a network meta-analysis was performed to explore the appropriate MT dose for SCI models. Thirteen studies were analyzed, of which three were high quality.

C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, SCI group, and melatonin group (n = 27 per group). Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso Mouse Scale. Motor neurons were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Pericyte coverage was analyzed using immunofluorescence. Permeability of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) was assessed by administration of Evan's Blue. Protein levels of occludin, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Bcl-2, and Bax were determined using Western blotting. Mimicking the pathological conditions of SCI, melatonin-treated primary pericytes were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Secretion of Ang1 was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of ICAM-1 was detected by immunofluorescence. Melatonin treatment improved locomotor functional outcome and rescued motor neurons. Pericyte coverage was significantly reduced after SCI; melatonin treatment alleviated the loss of pericyte coverage and rescued perfused microvessels 7 days after injury. The permeability of BSCB and loss of occludin were attenuated, and edema formation and upregulation of AQP4 were inhibited, after melatonin treatment. The expression of Ang1 and Bcl-2 was improved, while the expression of ICAM-1 and Bax was inhibited, in melatonin-treated SCI mice. Furthermore, the secretion of Ang1 was increased and the expression of ICAM-1 was inhibited in melatonin-treated pericytes after OGD/R. Melatonin ameliorated the loss of blood vessels and disruption of BSCB to exert a protective effect on SCI, which might be mediated by increased pericyte coverage. The upregulation of Ang1 in pericytes could inhibit inflammation and apoptosis to protect the microvessels.","melatonin","pubmed"

Theoretically, it is expected that early blockade of activation of MMPs can provide neuro-protective effects from secondary tissue damage and improve functional neurological outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and to determine the regulatory effect of melatonin on MMP expression and activity after photochemically induced SCI in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300 g (age 8 weeks) received focal ischemia by photothrombosis using Rose Bengal (RB). The injured animals were divided into two groups; one group received 50 mg/kg of melatonin intraperitoneally, starting 1 h after injury and at 12 h intervals for 7 days, while animals in the control group received weight-adjusted doses of a saline vehicle. In each group, the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by Western blot and gelatin zymography at various times from 6 h to 3 days. The locomotor function was assessed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale at 3 days after SCI and then once per week for 4 weeks. The animals were killed at 28 days after the injury, and the histopathology of the lesions was assessed. The expressions and activities of MMP-9 were increased at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI in the control group. In the melatonin-treated group, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI compared with the control group, and the activity of MMP-9 was significantly reduced at 72 h after SCI. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the MMP-2 level in both groups during the experimental period. Melatonin treatment following photochemically induced SCI in rats significantly ameliorated the functional deficits. On histopathologic examination, the lesion size in the spinal cord after photothrombotic insult was significantly reduced by melatonin administration. This study showed that the up-regulation of MMP-9 correlated with the secondary damage after SCI in rats. The results of this study suggest that the ability of melatonin to reduce secondary tissue damage is intimately related to the reduction of MMP-9 expression, resulting in functional improvement.","melatonin","pubmed"

Melatonin was administered twice a day and exercise was performed on a treadmill for 15 min, six days per week for 3 weeks after SCI. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis were used to determine cell population for late response, in conjunction with histological examination and motor function test. There was marked improvement in hindlimb function in SCI+MT+Ex group at day 14 and 21 after injury, as documented by the reduced size of the spinal lesion and a higher density of dendritic spines and axons; such functional improvements were associated with increased numbers of BrdU-positive cells. Furthermore, MAP2 was increased in the injured thoracic segment, while GFAP was increased in the cervical segment, along with elevated numbers of BrdU-positive nestin-expressing eNSPCs in the SCI+MT+Ex group. The dendritic spine density was augmented markedly in SCI+MT and SCI+MT+Ex groups.These results suggest a synergistic effect of SCI+MT+Ex might create a microenvironment to facilitate proliferation of eNSPCs to effectively replace injured cells and to improve regeneration in SCI.","melatonin","pubmed"

We examined the effect of melatonin on traumatic compression of the spinal cord. Sixty male adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated animals and animals with 35 and 50% spinal cord compression with a polycarbonate rod spacer. Each group was divided into two subgroups, each receiving an injection of vehicle or melatonin (2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 5 min prior to and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after injury. Functional recovery was monitored weekly by the open-field test, the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor scale and the inclined plane test. Histological changes of the spinal cord were examined 35 days after injury. Motor scores were progressively lower as spacer size increased according to the motor scale and inclined plane test evaluation at all times of assessment. The results of the two tests were correlated. The open-field test presented similar results with a less pronounced difference between the 35 and 50% compression groups. The injured groups presented functional recovery that was more evident in the first and second weeks. Animals receiving melatonin treatment presented more pronounced functional recovery than vehicle-treated animals as measured by the motor scale or inclined plane. NADPH-d histochemistry revealed integrity of the spinal cord thoracic segment in sham-operated animals and confirmed the severity of the lesion after spinal cord narrowing. The results obtained after experimental compression of the spinal cord support the hypothesis that melatonin may be considered for use in clinical practice because of its protective effect on the secondary wave of neuronal death following the primary wave after spinal cord injury.","melatonin","pubmed"

Melatonin (10 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for 4 wk, twice daily (07:00, 19:00). Locomotor recovery, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), glial fibrillary acidic protein gene expression, and muscle atrophy-related genes, including muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle-specific ring-finger protein 1 (MuRF1) gene expression were evaluated. Furthermore, autophagic signaling such as Beclin-1 and LC3 protein expression was examined in the spinal cord and in skeletal muscle. The melatonin treatment resulted in increased hind-limb motor function and decreased iNOS mRNA expression in the L/D condition compared with the LL condition (P < 0.05), indicating that endogenous melatonin had neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, the MAFbx, MuRF1 mRNA level, and converted LC3 II protein expression were decreased in the melatonin-treated SCI groups under the LL (P < 0.05), possibly in response to the exogenous melatonin treatment. Therefore, it seems that both endogenous and exogenous melatonin contribute to neural recovery and to the prevention of skeletal muscle atrophy, promoting functional recovery after SCI. Finally, this study supports the benefit of endogenous melatonin and use of exogenous melatonin as a therapeutic intervention for SCI.","melatonin","pubmed"

Subsequent to SCI in humans, many individuals have residual motor and sensory deficits that impair functional performance and quality of life. The available treatments for SCI are rehabilitation therapy, activity-based therapies, and pharmacological treatment using antioxidants and their agonists. Among pharmacological treatments, the most efficient and commonly used antioxidant for experimental SCI treatment is melatonin, an indolamine secreted by pineal gland at night. Melatonin's receptor-independent free radical scavenging action and its broad-spectrum antioxidant activity makes it an ideal antioxidant to protect tissue from oxidative stress-induced secondary damage after SCI. Owing to the limitations of an activity-based therapy and antioxidant treatment singly on the functional recovery and oxidative stress-induced secondary damages after SCI, a melatonin plus exercise treatment may be a more effective therapy for SCI. As suggested herein, supplementation with melatonin in conjunction with exercise not only would improve the functional recovery by enhancing the beneficial effects of exercise but would reduce the secondary tissue damage simultaneously. Finally, melatonin may protect against exercise-induced fatigue and impairments. In this review, based on the documented evidence regarding the beneficial effects of melatonin, activity-based therapy and the combination of both on functional recovery, as well as reduction of secondary damage caused by oxidative stress after SCI, we suggest the melatonin combined with exercise would be a novel neurorehabilitative strategy for the faster recovery after SCI.","melatonin","pubmed"

Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of MP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","melatonin","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury was induced by placing 25 g of weight extradurally on the rat spinal cord at T12 for 20 minutes. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. Sham rats had only laminectomy. Melatonin rats were injected with melatonin (2.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (intraperitoneal) five times: at 5 minutes, then 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the injury. Correspondingly, the control rats were injected with saline. Measured levels of lipid peroxidation estimated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and the accumulation of leukocytes at the site of trauma, which were evaluated by measuring tissue myeloperoxidase activity. The recovery was assessed by using three clinical scoring systems, and histologic changes of the damaged spinal cord were examined. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content in the spinal cord increased after the injury, with two peaks (at 1 and 4 hours), and nitrogen mustard-induced leukocytopenia significantly attenuated the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content in four 4 after injury. Also in these 4 hours, myeloperoxidase activity increased and melatonin injection reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content and myeloperoxidase activity, which attenuated the motor deficits as well. Histologic findings showed that the melatonin group had less cavity formation than the control group.

Thus, seeking for valid drugs that are beneficial to promoting axonal regrowth and elongation after SCI has gained wide attention. Metformin, a glucose-lowering agent, has been demonstrated to play roles in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the potential protective effect of metformin on nerve regeneration after SCI is still unclear. In this study, we found that the administration of metformin improved functional recovery after SCI through reducing neuronal cell apoptosis and repairing neurites by stabilizing microtubules via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002 partly reversed the therapeutic effects of metformin on SCI in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, metformin treatment weakened the excessive activation of oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 partially abolished its antioxidant effect. We also found that the Nrf2 transcription was partially reduced by LY294002 in vitro. Taken together, these results revealed that the role of metformin in nerve regeneration after SCI was probably related to stabilization of microtubules and inhibition of the excessive activation of Akt-mediated Nrf2/ARE pathway-regulated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our present study suggests that metformin administration may provide a potential therapy for SCI.","metformin","pubmed"

Experimental Medicine Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran METHODS: In an animal model of SCI, 48 male rats were subjected to T9 vertebra laminectomy. Animals were divided into a SHAM-operated group and five treatment groups. The treatments included normal saline as a vehicle control group, minocycline 90 mg/kg and metformin at the doses of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg. Locomotor scaling, behavioral tests for neuropathic pain and weight changes were evaluated and compared through a 28-days period. At the end of the study, tissue samples were taken to assess neuroinflammatory changes. Metformin 50 mg/kg improved the locomotors ability (p < 0.001) and decreased sensitivity to mechanical and thermal allodynia (p < 0.01). These results were compatible with minocycline effect on SCI (p > 0.05). While metformin led to weight loss, both metformin and minocycline significantly decreased neuroinflammation in the assessment of cord tissue histopathology, and levels of TNF-α and interleukin-1β (p < 0.001). Metformin could be considered as an alternative therapeutic agent for SCI, as it potentially attenuates neuroinflammation, sensory and locomotor complications of cord injury.","metformin","pubmed"

Previously, we demonstrated that metformin could improve functional recovery after SCI; however, the effect of metformin on BSCB is still unknown. In this study, we found that metformin could prevent the loss of tight junction (TJ) proteins at day 3 after SCI in vivo, but in vitro there was no significant difference of these proteins between control and metformin treatment in endothelial cells. This indicated that metformin-induced BSCB protection might not be mediated by up-regulating TJ proteins directly, but by inhibiting TJ proteins degradation. Thus, we investigated the role of metformin on MMP-9 and neutrophils infiltration. Neutrophils infiltration is the major source of the enhanced MMP-9 in SCI. Our results showed that metformin decreased MMP-9 production and blocked neutrophils infiltration at day 1 after injury, which might be related to ICAM-1 down-regulation. Also, our in vitro study showed that metformin inhibited TNF-α-induced MMP-9 up-regulation in neutrophils, which might be mediated via an AMPK-dependent pathway.

Using a rat model of traumatic SCI, we found improved function recovery which was paralleled by a reduction of apoptosis after metformin treatment. We further examined autophagy via detecting autophagosomes by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, as well as autophagy markers by western blot in each groups. The results showed that the number of autophagosomes and expression of autophagy markers such as LC3 and beclin1 were increased in SCI group, while autophagy substrate protein p62 as well as ubiquitinated proteins were found to accumulate in SCI group, indicating an impaired autophagy flux in SCI. But, metformin treatment attenuated the accumulation of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a stimulative effect of autophagy flux by metformin. Blockage of autophagy flux by chloroquine partially abolished the apoptosis inhibition and functional recovery effect of metformin on SCI, which suggested that the protective effect of metformin on SCI was through autophagy flux stimulation. Activation of AMPK as well as inhibition of its downstream mTOR signaling were detected under metformin treatment in vivo and in vitro; inhibition of AMPK signaling by compound C suppressed autophagy flux induced by metformin in vitro, indicating that AMPK signaling was involved in the effect of metformin on autophagy flux regulation.

Thus, we are going to screen the effectiveness of telmisartan in SCI for the development of it in clinical application. In the present study, we used compressive SCI in rats. Telmisartan was then used to evaluate the influence in rats after SCI. Change in PPARδ expression was identified by Western blots.

Additionally, this action of telmisartan was inhibited by GSK0660 at the dose sufficient to block PPARδ. However, metformin at the dose enough to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase failed to produce similar action as telmisartan. Thus, mediation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in this action of telmisartan can be rule out. Moreover, telmisartan reversed the expressions of PPARδ in rats with SCI.

Here, we investigated directly reprogrammed human NPCs biased toward an oligodendrogenic fate (oNPCs) in combination with sustained delivery of ChABC using an innovative affinity release strategy in a crosslinked methylcellulose biomaterial for the treatment of chronic SCI in an immunodeficient rat model. This combinatorial therapy increased long-term survival of oNPCs around the lesion epicenter, facilitated greater oligodendrocyte differentiation, remyelination of the spared axons by engrafted oNPCs, enhanced synaptic connectivity with anterior horn cells and neurobehavioral recovery.

Due to the complex nature of SCI pathology, a combination treatment strategy will likely be required for success. We hypothesized that tissue and functional repair would be achieved in a rat model of impact-compression SCI by combining degradation of the glial scar, using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), with recruitment of endogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs), using stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF). To test this hypothesis, we designed a crosslinked methylcellulose hydrogel (XMC) for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal drug delivery. ChABC was released from XMC using protein-peptide affinity interactions while SDF was delivered by electrostatic affinity interactions from polymeric nanoparticles embedded in XMC. Rats with SCI were treated acutely with a combination of SDF and ChABC, SDF alone, ChABC alone, or vehicle alone, and compared to injury only. Treatment with ChABC, both alone and in combination with SDF, resulted in faster and more sustained behavioural improvement over time than other groups. The significantly reduced chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan levels and greater distribution of NPCs throughout the spinal cord tissue with ChABC delivery, both alone and in combination with SDF, may explain the improved locomotor function. Treatment with SDF alone had no apparent effect on NPC number or distribution nor synergistic effect with ChABC delivery. Thus, in this model of SCI, tissue and functional repair is attributed to ChABC.","methylcellulose","pubmed"

Stem cell therapy is a promising approach for spinal cord injury (SCI); however, this strategy is currently limited by the poor survival and uncontrolled differentiation of transplanted stem cells. In an attempt to achieve greater survival and integration with the host tissue, we examined the survival and efficacy of adult brain-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) injected within a hydrogel blend of hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) into a subacute, clinically relevant model of rat SCI. Prior to use, HAMC was covalently modified with recombinant rat platelet-derived growth factor-A (rPDGF-A) to promote oligodendrocytic differentiation. SCI rats transplanted with NSPCs in HAMC-rPDGF-A showed improved behavioral recovery compared to rats transplanted with NSPCs in media. Rats with NSPC/HAMC-rPDGF-A transplants had a significant reduction in cavitation, improved graft survival, increased oligodendrocytic differentiation, and sparing of perilesional host oligodendrocytes and neurons. These data suggest that HAMC-rPDGF-A is a promising vehicle for cell delivery to the injured spinal cord.","methylcellulose","pubmed"

To achieve this sustained release, anti-NogoA is typically delivered by osmotic minipumps; however, external minipumps are susceptible to infection. To address this issue, we developed a drug delivery system that consists of anti-NogoA-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles dispersed in a hydrogel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (composite HAMC). To optimize in vitro release, we screened formulations for improved anti-NogoA bioactivity and sustained release based on combinations of co-encapsulated trehalose, hyaluronan, MgCO(3), and CaCO(3). Co-encapsulated MgCO(3) and CaCO(3) slowed the rate of anti-NogoA release and did not influence anti-NogoA bioactivity. Co-encapsulated trehalose significantly improved anti-NogoA bioactivity at early release time points by stabilizing the protein during lyophilization. Co-encapsulated trehalose with hyaluronan improved bioactivity up to 28d and dramatically increased the rate and duration of sustained delivery. The sustained release of bioactive anti-NogoA from composite HAMC is a compelling formulation for in vivo evaluation in a model of spinal cord injury.","methylcellulose","pubmed"

Our goal was to improve the number and type of regenerated axons within the spinal cord through the addition of different matrices and growth factors incorporated within the lumen of the channel. After complete spinal cord transection at T8, pHEMA-MMA channels, having an elastic modulus of 263+/-13 kPa were implanted into adult Sprague Dawley rats. The channels were then filled with one of the following matrices: collagen, fibrin, Matrigel, methylcellulose, or smaller pHEMA-MMA tubes placed within a larger pHEMA-MMA channel (called tubes within channels, TWC). We also supplemented selected matrices (collagen and fibrin) with neurotrophic factors, fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). After channel implantation, fibrin glue was applied to the cord-channel interface, and a duraplasty was performed with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane. Controls included animals that had either complete spinal cord transection and implantation of unfilled pHEMA-MMA channels or complete spinal cord transection. Regeneration was assessed by retrograde axonal tracing with Fluoro-Gold, and immunohistochemistry with NF-200 (for total axon counts) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP, for sensory axon counts) after 8 weeks survival. Fibrin, Matrigel, methylcellulose, collagen with FGF-1, collagen with NT-3, fibrin with FGF-1, and fibrin with NT-3 increased the total axon density within the channel (ANOVA, p<0.05) compared to unfilled channel controls. Only fibrin with FGF-1 decreased the sensory axon density compared to unfilled channel controls (ANOVA, p<0.05). Fibrin promoted the greatest axonal regeneration from reticular neurons, and methylcellulose promoted the greatest regeneration from vestibular and red nucleus neurons. With Matrigel, there was no axonal regeneration from brainstem motor neurons. The addition of FGF-1 increased the axonal regeneration of vestibular neurons, and the addition of NT-3 decreased the total number of axons regenerating from brainstem neurons. The fibrin and TWC showed a consistent improvement in locomotor function at both 7 and 8 weeks. Thus, the present study shows that the presence and type of matrix contained within synthetic hydrogel guidance channels affects the quantity and origin of axons that regenerate after complete spinal cord transection, and can improve functional recovery. Determining the optimum matrices and growth factors for insertion into these guidance channels will improve regeneration of the injured spinal cord.","methylcellulose","pubmed"

Variations in the amplitude of motor evoked responses in the hindlimb muscles induced by epidural stimulation during acute phase of SCI and restoration of movements during chronic period after local vs. systemic application of MPS were evaluated in this study.

In addition, this formulation was found to be more effective in improvement of locomotion after SCI compared to systemic administration. LC-MS/MS data shows that the use of TBC carrier increases the glucocorticoid content in treated spinal cord by more than four times over other modes of treatment.

We aimed to objectively evaluate the effect of timing of decompressive surgery for acute SCI on long-term neurological outcomes. We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data derived from four independent, prospective, multicentre data sources, including data from December, 1991, to March, 2017. Three of these studies had been published; of these, only one study previously specifically analysed the effect of the timing of surgical decompression. These four datasets were selected because they were among the highest quality acute SCI datasets available and contained highly granular data. Individual patient data were obtained by request from study authors. All patients who underwent decompressive surgery for acute SCI within these datasets were included. Patients were stratified into early (<24 h after spinal injury) and late (≥24 h after spinal injury) decompression groups. Neurological outcomes were assessed by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), or International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), examination. The primary endpoint was change in total motor score from baseline to 1 year after spinal injury. Secondary endpoints were ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade and change in upper-extremity motor, lower-extremity motor, light touch, and pin prick scores after 1 year. One-stage meta-analyses were done by hierarchical mixed-effects regression adjusting for baseline score, age, mechanism of injury, AIS grade, level of injury, and administration of methylprednisolone. Effect sizes were summarised by mean difference (MD) for sensorimotor scores and common odds ratio (cOR) for AIS grade, with corresponding 95% CIs. As a secondary analysis, change in total motor score was regressed against time to surgical decompression (h) as a continuous variable, using a restricted cubic spline with adjustment for the same covariates as in the primary analysis. We identified 1548 eligible patients from the four datasets. Outcome data at 1 year after spinal injury were available for 1031 patients (66·6%). Patients who underwent early surgical decompression (n=528) experienced greater recovery than patients who had late decompression surgery (n=1020) at 1 year after spinal injury; total motor scores improved by 23·7 points (95% CI 19·2-28·2) in the early surgery group versus 19·7 points (15·3-24·0) in the late surgery group (MD 4·0 points [1·7-6·3]; p=0·0006), light touch scores improved by 19·0 points (15·1-23·0) vs 14·8 points (11·2-18·4; MD 4·3 [1·6-7·0]; p=0·0021), and pin prick scores improved by 18·3 points (13·7-22·9) versus 14·2 points (9·8-18·6; MD 4·0 [1·5-6·6]; p=0·0020). Patients who had early decompression also had better AIS grades at 1 year after surgery, indicating less severe impairment, compared with patients who had late surgery (cOR 1·48 [95% CI 1·16-1·89]; p=0·0019). When time to surgical decompression was modelled as a continuous variable, there was a steep decline in change in total motor score with increasing time during the first 24-36 h after injury (p<0·0001); and after 36 h, change in total motor score plateaued. Surgical decompression within 24 h of acute SCI is associated with improved sensorimotor recovery. The first 24-36 h after injury appears to represent a crucial time window to achieve optimal neurological recovery with decompressive surgery following acute SCI. None.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

To date, systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) have shown promise in SCI. However, systemic immunosuppression can have detrimental side effects. Therefore, immunomodulatory approaches including the use of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) could represent an attractive alternative. While emerging preclinical data suggests that hIgG is neuroprotective after SCI, the optimal time window of administration and the mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. These knowledge gaps were the focus of this research study. Female adult Wistar rats received a clip compression-contusion SCI at the C7/T1 level of the spinal cord. Injured rats were randomized, in a blinded manner, to receive a single intravenous bolus of hIgG (2 g/kg) or control buffer at 15 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) or 4 h post-SCI. At 24 h and 8 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological and neurobehavioral analyses were undertaken. At all 3 administration time points, hIgG (2 g/kg) resulted in significantly better short-term and long-term outcomes as compared to control buffer. No significant differences were observed when comparing outcomes between the different time points of administration. At 24 h post-injury, hIgG (2 g/kg) administration enhanced the integrity of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) by increasing expression of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in BSCB integrity were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, lower amounts of albumin and Evans Blue in the injured spinal cord and greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. After hIgG (2 g/kg) treatment, there were more neutrophils in the spleen and fewer neutrophils in the blood. hIgG also co-localized with endothelial cell ligands that mediate neutrophil extravasation into the injured spinal cord. Importantly, short-term effects of delayed hIgG (2 g/kg) administration were associated with enhanced tissue and neuron preservation, as well as neurobehavioral and sensory recovery at 8 weeks post-SCI. hIgG (2 g/kg) shows promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by hIgG (2 g/kg) in the injured spinal cord might be explained in twofold. First, hIgG might antagonize neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord by co-localizing with endothelial cell ligands that mediate various steps in neutrophil extravasation. Second, hIgG could traffic neutrophils towards the spleen by increasing expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. Overall, we demonstrate that delayed administration of hIgG (2 g/kg) at 1 and 4-h post-injury enhances short-term and long-term benefits after SCI by modulating local and systemic neuroinflammatory cascades.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Metformin(50 mg/kg) promoted motor functional recovery in rats after SCI, increased the expressions of β-catenin and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inhibited neuron apoptosis and inflammatory response, and improved the recovery of pathological morphology at the injury site by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

In this study the authors aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of ozone and their possible roles in recovery from spine injury, assessed based on biochemical, histological, and neurological parameters using an experimental spine injury model in rats. The study included 31 female Wistar albino rats. The rats were divided randomly into 5 groups, with 7 rats in each group except the sham group, which contained 3 rats, as follows: group 1 (sham), laminectomy; group 2 (control), laminectomy and spinal trauma with no medical treatment (0.5 ml isotonic saline applied 1 hour postsurgery); group 3, single medical treatment with 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone applied intraperitoneally 1 hour after laminectomy and trauma; group 4, single medical treatment with 60 μg/ml ozone at 0.7 mg/kg applied intraperitoneally 1 hour after laminectomy and trauma; and group 5, double medical treatment with 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone and 60 μg/ml ozone at 0.7 mg/kg applied intraperitoneally 1 hour after laminectomy and trauma. After neurosurgery, neurobehavioral tests were performed in all groups. After 7 days of follow-up, all the rats were killed.

Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were measured in blood samples. The level of neurobehavioral healing was the highest in the double-treatment group (group 5), and the difference between the groups was significant. The minimum IL-6 level was found in group 5, indicating that the antiinflammatory impact was the most significant in this group (p = 0.01). Additionally, ozone was found to reduce oxidant stress more effectively than methylprednisolone (p = 0.03). Although methylprednisolone was superior to ozone in terms of the antiinflammatory effect, this effect was greater in group 5. Nevertheless, the number of neurons in group 5 was close to that of the control group, and the number of apoptotic cells was the least in group 5 (p < 0.001). In acute spinal injury, the combined application of methylprednisolone and ozone was found to have a greater antiinflammatory effect, hasten clinical recovery, and increase histological recovery compared with methylprednisolone therapy alone. This study showed that this combination therapy of methylprednisolone with the addition of ozone might have a more beneficial effect in the treatment of spinal injury than methylprednisolone therapy alone.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Adverse events as well as general health, weight and urodynamic functions were monitored daily. After this time, the animals were perfused, and the spinal cord tissue was investigated histologically. Rats treated with bmSC did not reject the human implants and showed no sign of sickness behavior or neuropathic pain. Compared to MP treatment, animals displayed better recovery of their SCI-induced motor deficits. There were no significant differences in the recovery of bladder control between groups. Histological analysis at ten weeks after SCI revealed no differences in tissue sparing and astrogliosis, however, bmSC treatment was accompanied with reduced axonal degeneration in the dorsal ascending fiber tracts, lower Iba1-immunoreactivity (IR) close to the lesion site and reduced apoptosis in the ventral grey matter. Neuroinflammation, as evidenced by CD68-IR, was significantly reduced in the MP-treated group. Human bmSC that were prepared by negative selection without expansion in culture have neuroprotective properties after SCI. Given the effect size on motor function, implantation in the acute phase was not sufficient to induce spinal cord repair. Due to their immune modulatory properties, allogeneic implants of bmSC can be used in combinatorial therapies of SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Therefore, timely rehabilitation treatment is beneficial for the partial recovery of patients with SCI. The present study aimed to investigate the use of methylprednisolone combined with high-frequency electrotherapy as a method of rehabilitation treatment in rats with SCI. The rat SCI model was prepared using the modified Allen's method with the animals randomly divided into the following 4 groups (n=10 for each group): SCI; methylprednisolone (300 mg/kg); high-frequency electrotherapy; and combination treatment with electrotherapy combined with methylprednisolone (300 mg/kg). The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score, somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) were used to assess spinal function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NF-κB expression levels were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-2 expression levels were determined by ELISA, and caspase 3 activity was also assessed. In all treatment groups, BDNF mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased, whilst those of NF-κB were reduced. Additionally, an elevated BBB score, improved SEPs and MEPs, inhibited caspase 3 activity and downregulated TNF-α and IL-2 expression levels were observed, compared with the SCI group (P<0.05). However, the combination group exhibited more significant effects on SCI. In conclusion, methylprednisolone combined with high frequency electrotherapy may improve the symptoms of SCI by increasing the expression level of BDNF, reducing that of NF-κB, and suppressing the secretion of inflammatory factors.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library (to May 22, 2018) for studies comparing neurologic recoveries, adverse events, and in-hospital costs between ASCI patients who underwent high-dose MP treatment or not. Data were synthesized with corresponding statistical models according to the degree of heterogeneity. We enrolled 16 studies (1,863 participants) including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 13 observational studies. Pooled results indicated that MP was not associated with an increase in motor score improvement (RCTs: p = 0.84; observational studies: p = 0.44) and incidence of recovery by at least one grade on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale or Frankel (p = 0.53). Meanwhile, MP did not lead to better sensory recovery (p = 0.07). However, MP was associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and respiratory tract infection (p = 0.01). The difference in the overall in-hospital costs between MP and control groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.78). Based on the current evidence, high-dose MP treatment, in comparison to controls, does not contribute to better neurologic recoveries but may increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ASCI. Therefore, we recommend against routine use of high-dose MP early after ASCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The blood-spinal cord barrier consists of pericytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, which are collectively termed the neurovascular unit. These cells support spinal cord homeostasis by expressing tight junction proteins. Physical trauma to the spinal cord disrupts the barrier, which leads to neuroinflammation by facilitating immune cell migration to the damaged site in a process involving immune cell adhesion. Immunosuppressive strategies, including methylprednisolone (MPSS), have been investigated to treat SCI. However, despite some success, MPSS has the potential to increase a patient's susceptibility to wound infection and impaired wound healing. Hence, immunomodulation may be a more attractive approach than immunosuppression. Approved for modulating neuroinflammation in certain disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) has shown promise in the setting of experimental SCI, though the optimal dose and mechanism of action remain undetermined. Female adult Wistar rats were subjected to moderate-severe clip compression injury (35 g) at the C7-T1 level and randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV) bolus of hIgG (0.02, 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2 g/kg), MPSS (0.03 g/kg), or control buffer at 15 min post-SCI. At 24 h and 6 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological, and neurobehavioral effects of hIgG were analyzed. At 24 h post-injury, human immunoglobulin G co-localized with spinal cord pericytes, astrocytes, and vessels. hIgG (2 g/kg) protected the spinal cord neurovasculature after SCI by increasing tight junction protein expression and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in vascular integrity were associated with changes in spinal cord inflammation. Interestingly, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased serum expression of inflammatory cytokines and co-localized (without decreasing protein expression) with spinal cord vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a protein used by immune cells to enter into inflamed tissue. Acute molecular benefits of hIgG (2 g/kg) led to greater tissue preservation, functional blood flow, and neurobehavioral recovery at 6 weeks post-SCI. Importantly, the effects of hIgG (2 g/kg) were superior to control buffer and hIgG (0.4 g/kg), and comparable with MPSS (0.03 g/kg). hIgG (2 g/kg) is a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate secondary pathology in SCI through antagonizing immune cell infiltration at the level of the neurovascular unit.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

In this study, i.v. administered poly(lactide-coglycolide) nanoparticles were internalized by circulating monocytes and neutrophils, reprogramming these cells based on their physicochemical properties and not by an active pharmaceutical ingredient, to exhibit altered biodistribution, gene expression, and function. Approximately 80% of nanoparticle-positive immune cells were observed within the injury, and, additionally, the overall accumulation of innate immune cells at the injury was reduced 4-fold, coinciding with down-regulated expression of proinflammatory factors and increased expression of antiinflammatory and proregenerative genes. Furthermore, nanoparticle administration induced macrophage polarization toward proregenerative phenotypes at the injury and markedly reduced both fibrotic and gliotic scarring 3-fold. Moreover, nanoparticle administration with the implanted multichannel bridge led to increased numbers of regenerating axons, increased myelination with about 40% of axons myelinated, and an enhanced locomotor function (score of 6 versus 3 for control group). These data demonstrate that nanoparticles provide a platform that limits acute inflammation and tissue destruction, at a favorable risk-benefit ratio, leading to a proregenerative microenvironment that supports regeneration and functional recovery. These particles may have applications to trauma and potentially other inflammatory diseases.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

In the present study, an acute SCI rat model was induced and, following a modified Allen method, the function of pectolinarigenin (PG) in SCI was investigated. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=6 in each group); a sham surgery group and an SCI + saline group were used as negative controls and an SCI + MP (30 mg/kg) group was used as a positive control. The remaining animals were subdivided into three groups: SCI + PG (10 mg/kg); SCI + PG (30 mg/kg); and SCI + PG (50 mg/kg). Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor rating scoring was performed to assess functional recovery. Nissl staining and TUNEL staining were used to evaluated neuronal lesion volume and apoptosis, respectively. The results demonstrated that PG significantly improved functional recovery and reduced tissue loss, and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, a western blotting assay was conducted to measure the expression of genes associated with apoptosis. The data suggested that PG downregulated the activated caspase-3, caspase-9 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase expression and reduced the Bax: Bcl2 ratio. The findings of the present study suggested that PG may exert a protective effect against SCI in rats, potentially by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and PG may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic agent against SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Albumin-based nanoparticles, which can encapsulate therapeutic drugs and release cargo in a controlled pattern, show high biocompatibility and low toxicity. The Nogo protein, expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes, can inhibit axonal growth by binding with the axonal Nogo receptor (NgR). Peptide NEP1-40, an NgR antagonist, can bind specifically to Nogo, significantly improving functional recovery and axon growth in the corticospinal tract. Therefore, we hypothesized that delivering MP within nanoparticles decorated with NEP1-40 could avoid the disadvantages of free MP and enhance its therapeutic efficacy against SCI. We used human serum albumin to prepare MP-loaded NPs (MP-NPs), to whose surface we conjugated NEP1-40 to form NEP1-40-MP-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated successful formation of nanoparticles. NEP1-40-MP-NPs were taken up significantly better than MP-NPs by the Nogo-positive cell line RSC-96 and were associated with significantly higher Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores in rats recovering from SCI.

Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials.

The current treatment for moderate to severe DCM consists of surgical decompression, which, while effective in most cases, can result in neuroinflammation and spinal cord reperfusion injury, leading to perioperative neurological complications and suboptimal neurological recovery. The primary objective of this study was to assess, in a translationally relevant animal model of DCM, the efficacy of perioperative methylprednisolone (MP) in enhancing neurological recovery and to evaluate its effect on the inflammatory response following decompression. DCM was induced in C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, an aromatic polyether material was implanted underneath the C5-C6 laminae to cause progressive compression of the cervical spinal cord due to focal ossification. Decompressive surgery was undertaken at 12 weeks post initial biomaterial implantation. Animals received one dose of MP (30 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min before decompression and at 2 weeks after decompression. Acute analysis of secreted cytokines and spinal cord microvasculature was complemented with immunohistochemistry for glial and neuronal cell markers. Locomotor outcomes were measured using the CatWalk system. The composition of circulating white blood cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. A single dose of MP before decompression significantly sped locomotor recovery (*p < 0.05) and reduced the incidence of perioperative motor complications, without affecting the composition of circulating white blood cells. Histological assessment of the spinal cord showed significant neuronal preservation and a modest reduction in parenchymal inflammation. Our data suggest that MP reduces perioperative neurological complications following decompressive surgery for DCM by protecting neurons from inflammation, without compromising the composition of circulating immune cells. We propose that MP, which is commonly used for neurological disorders including spinal cord injury, be considered as a perioperative adjunct to decompressive surgery to attenuate neurological complications.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Governor Vessel electroacupuncture can improve symptoms of spinal cord injury by inhibiting cell apoptosis and improving the microenvironment of the injured spinal cord. In this study, Governor Vessel electroacupuncture combined with decompression at different time points was used to treat acute spinal cord injury. The rat models were established by inserting a balloon catheter into the atlanto-occipital space. The upper cervical spinal cord was compressed for 12 or 48 hours prior to decompression. Electroacupuncture was conducted at the acupoints Dazhui (GV14) and Baihui (GV 20) (2 Hz, 15 minutes) once a day for 14 consecutive days. Compared with decompression alone, hind limb motor function recovery was superior after decompression for 12 and 48 hours combined with electroacupuncture. However, the recovery of motor function was not significantly different at 14 days after treatment in rats receiving decompression for 12 hours. Platelet-activating factor levels and caspase-9 protein expression were significantly reduced in rats receiving electroacupuncture compared with decompression alone. These findings indicate that compared with decompression alone, Governor Vessel electroacupuncture combined with delayed decompression (48 hours) is more effective in the treatment of upper cervical spinal cord injury.

Four groups received different treatments for the study: SCI control, MP, MP and EA, and Sham. The growth of nerve fibers was examined by counting fluorescein positive nerve fibers. The motor functional recovery was evaluated by Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) score, and electrophysiology analysis. We found that, compared to MP groups, there were more well-oriented and paralleled fluorescein positive nerve fibers in MP and EA group. Both latencies and amplitudes of the Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) in the combination therapy of MP and EA were higher than MP group. Additionally, recovered hindlimb movements were sustained in most rats in the MP and EA group.

From the third day after SCI, BBB score of the MP+Mdivi-1 group was obviously higher than the other experimental groups (p < 0.05). Compared with the SCI group, tissue water content of the Mdivi-1 group and MP+Mdivi-1 group reduced obviously (p < 0.05), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level and ATP content in the Mdivi-1 group and MP+Mdivi-1 group were both higher (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, three kinds of treatment all reduced apoptosis significantly, while MP plus Mdivi-1 exhibited the best inhibition effect on apoptosis (p < 0.05). The expression levels of Drp1, cytochrome c, and caspase-3 were all upregulated obviously; Mdivi-1 could inhibit Drp1 upregulation induced by SCI; for the upregulation of cytochrome c and caspase-3, the inhibition effect of Mdivi-1 approached MP. When MP combined with Mdivi-1, there was the best inhibition effect. MP combined with Mdivi-1 may produce better neurological function recovery, through improving functional status of mitochondria and inhibiting lipid peroxidation in damaged tissue of SCI rats, and thus alleviating apoptosis.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Methods We prepared a TSCI model using Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were divided into a Naru-3 group and a methylprednisolone group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to measure the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were employed to detect serum inflammatory cytokine levels. The localization and expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in spinal cord tissue was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the ratio of M1- and M2-phenotype macrophages. The locomotor function recovery was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an endogenous protein which regulates cell proliferation, growth and differention. Previous studies reported that EGF exerts neuroprotective effect in spinal cord after SCI. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EGF-mediated protection in different regions of nervous system have not shown yet. In this study, we aimed to examine possible anti-apoptotic and protective roles of EGF not only in spinal cord but also in brain following SCI. Twenty-eight adult rats were divided into four groups of seven animals each as follows: sham, trauma (SCI), SCI + EGF and SCI + methylprednisolone (MP) groups. The functional neurological deficits due to the SCI were assessed by behavioral analysis using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor test. The alterations in pro-/anti-apoptotic protein levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in spinal cord and frontal cortex. In our study, EGF promoted locomotor recovery and motor neuron survival of SCI rats. EGF treatment significantly decreased Bax and increased Bcl-2 protein expressions both in spinal cord and brain when compared to SCI group. Moreover, antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were increased following EGF treatment similar to MP treatment. Our experiment also suggests that alteration of the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax may result from decreased apoptosis following EGF treatment. As a conclusion, these results show, for the first time, that administration of EGF exerts its protection via regulating apoptotic and oxidative pathways in response to spinal cord injury in different regions of central nervous system.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The search yielded 723 citations, 13 of which satisfied inclusion criteria. Among these, 6 were primary research articles and 7 were previous systematic reviews. Based on the included research articles, there was moderate evidence that the 24-hour NASCIS II (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies) MPSS regimen has no impact on long-term neurological recovery when all postinjury time points are considered. However, there is also moderate evidence that subjects receiving the same MPSS regimen within 8 hours of injury achieve an additional 3.2 points (95% confidence interval = 0.10 to 6.33; P = .04) of motor recovery compared with patients receiving placebo or no treatment.

MPSS treatment became the standard of care in adults despite a lack of evidence supporting clinical benefit. More recently, new guidelines from neurological surgeon groups recommended no longer using MPSS for ASCI, due to questionable clinical benefit and known complications. However, little information exists in the pediatric population regarding MPSS use in the setting of ASCI. The aim of this paper was to describe steroid use and side effects in patients with ASCI at the authors' Level 1 pediatric trauma center in order to inform other hospitals that may still use this therapy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine adherence in ordering and delivery according to the guideline of the authors' institution and to determine types and frequency of complications. Inclusion criteria included age < 17 years, blunt trauma, physician concern for ASCI, and admission for ≥ 24 hours or treatment with high-dose intravenous MPSS. Exclusion criteria included penetrating trauma, no documentation of ASCI, and incomplete medical records. Charts were reviewed for a predetermined list of complications. RESULTS A total of 602 patient charts were reviewed; 354 patients were included in the study. MPSS was administered in 59 cases. In 34 (57.5%) the order was placed correctly. In 13 (38.2%) of these 34 cases, MPSS was administered according to the recommended timeline protocol. Overall, only 13 (22%) of 59 patients received the therapy according to protocol with regard to accurate ordering and administration. Among the patients with ASCI, 20 (55.6%) of the 36 who received steroids had complications, which was a significantly higher rate than in those who did not receive steroids (8 [24.2%] of 33, p = 0.008). Among the patients without ASCI, 10 (43.5%) of the 23 who received steroids also experienced significantly more complications than patients who did not receive steroids (50 [19.1%] of 262, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS High-dose MPSS for ASCI was not delivered to pediatric patients according to protocol with a high degree of reliability. Patients receiving steroids for pediatric ASCI were significantly more likely to experience complications than patients not receiving steroids. The findings presented, including complications of steroid use, support removal of high-dose MPSS as a treatment option for pediatric ASCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of C-terminal domain of tetanus toxin (Hc-TeTx) on cell death mechanisms including apoptosis and autophagy following SCI. Traumatic SCI can lead to posttraumatic inflammation, oxidative stress, motor neuron apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy of tissue. To promote and enhance recovery after SCI, recent development of devices and therapeutic interventions are needed. Twenty-eight adult rats were divided into four groups (n = 7 each) as follows: sham, trauma (SCI), SCI + Hc-TeTx, and SCI + methylprednisolone groups. The functional neurological deficits due to the SCI were assessed by behavioral analysis using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor test. The alterations in pro-/anti-apoptotic and autophagy related-protein levels were measured by Western blotting technique. In this study, Hc-TeTx promotes locomotor recovery and motor neuron survival of SCI rats. Hc-TeTx also decreased expression of bax, bad, bak, cleaved caspase-3, Ask1, and autophagy-related proteins including Atg5 and LC3II in brain. Our study provides an evidence that cell death mechanisms play critical roles in SCI and that the nontoxic peptides including Hc-TeTx may exert protective effect and decrease cell death following SCI. Our preliminary findings suggest a possible therapeutic agent to improve survival after spinal cord trauma, but further analysis are still needed to evaluate the difference between acute and chronic injuries.

There is a prolonged recovery phase, which may continue for many years. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an uncommon relapsing inflammatory central nervous system condition in which TM can be the first presenting symptom. As TM and NMO affect many patients in the prime of their working life, the disorder can impose a significant demand on health resources. There are currently no robust controlled trials in children or adults to inform the optimal treatment of TM. However, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is being effectively used in the management of a range of neurological conditions. Although other interventions such as plasma exchange (PLEX) in addition to intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone therapy can be beneficial in TM, PLEX is costly and technically challenging to deliver in the acute setting. IVIG is more readily accessible and less costly. To evaluate whether additional and early treatment with IVIG is of extra benefit in TM compared with standard therapy with IV steroids. A multicentre, single-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial of IVIG compared with standard therapy for the treatment of TM in adults and children. Patients aged ≥ 1 year diagnosed with either acute first-onset TM or first presentation of NMO. Target recruitment was 170 participants (85 participants per arm). Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to treatment with IV methylprednisolone only or treatment with IV methylprednisolone plus 2 g/kg of IVIG in divided doses within 5 days of the first commencement of steroid therapy. Primary outcome measure - American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale at 6 months post randomisation, with a good outcome defined by a two-grade change. Secondary and tertiary outcome measures - ASIA motor and sensory scales, Expanded Disability Status Scale, health outcome, quality of life, Client Service Receipt Inventory and International Spinal Cord Injury Pain, Bladder and Bowel Basic Data Sets. In total, 26 participants were screened and two were randomised into the study. With the limited sample size, treatment effect could not be determined. However, we identified barriers to accrual that included strict inclusion criteria, the short enrolment window, challenges associated with the use of the ASIA Impairment Scale as an outcome measure and estimation of the incidence of TM. The study did not reach the end point and the effect of IVIG in TM/NMO could not be determined. Investigators should be aware of the potential challenges associated with carrying out a rare disease trial with a short enrolment window. The study question is one that still necessitates investigation. Preliminary work to ameliorate the effect of the barriers encountered in this study is vital.

Animals underwent behavioral evaluations for motor behavior, level of allodynia and hyperalgesia every week. At the end, spinal cord was extracted and IL-6 level was assessed by ELISA method. Treatment with MPSS and 2-week LLLT had led to motor function recovery (df: 24, 145; F=223.5; p <0.001). SCI did not affect mechanical (df: 24, 145; F=0.5; p=0.09), and cold allodynia (df: 24, 145; F=0.3; p=0.17) but significantly increased mechanical (df: 24, 145; F=21.4; p<0.001) and heat hyperalgesia (df: 24, 145; F=16.1; p<0.001). Treatment with MPSS and 1 and 2-weeks LLLT improved mechanical hyperalgesia (p<0.05) and heat hyperalgesia (p<0.01). The increased level of IL-6 following SCI was also compensated by administration of MPSS or LLLT (df: 4, 10; F=8.74; p=0.003). Findings show that long periods of LLLT have better effects in improving the complication of SCI. In summation, since LLLT does not cause the side effects of MPSS, long-term use of LLLT may be a proper alternative for MPSS in decreasing post SCI side effects.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Expediently delivering interventions during the early postinjury period can have a tremendous impact on long-term functional recovery. This is largely due to the unique pathophysiology of SCI where the initial traumatic insult (primary injury) is followed by a progressive secondary injury cascade characterized by ischemia, proapoptotic signaling, and peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration. Over the subsequent hours, release of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic debris (DNA, ATP, reactive oxygen species) cyclically adds to the harsh postinjury microenvironment. As the lesions mature into the chronic phase, regeneration is severely impeded by the development of an astroglial-fibrous scar surrounding coalesced cystic cavities. Addressing these challenges forms the basis of current and upcoming treatments for SCI. This paper discusses the evidence-based management of a patient with SCI while emphasizing the importance of early definitive care. Key neuroprotective therapies are summarized including surgical decompression, methylprednisolone, and blood pressure augmentation. We then review exciting neuroprotective interventions on the cusp of translation such as Riluzole, Minocycline, magnesium, therapeutic hypothermia, and CSF drainage. We also explore the most promising neuroregenerative strategies in trial today including Cethrin™, anti-NOGO antibody, cell-based approaches, and bioengineered biomaterials. Each section provides a working knowledge of the key preclinical and patient trials relevant to clinicians while highlighting the pathophysiologic rationale for the therapies.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study from September 2007 to November 2014 of 311 patients with acute TSCI who were enrolled into a model systems database of a regional, level I trauma center. We linked outcomes and covariate data from the model systems database with MP exposure data from the electronic medical record. The primary outcomes were rehabilitation discharge in American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores (sum of 10 key muscles bilaterally as per International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, range, 0-100) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) motor scores (range, 13-91). Secondary outcomes measured infection risk and gastrointestinal (GI) complications among MP recipients. For the primary outcomes, multivariable linear regression was used. There were 160 MP recipients and 151 nonrecipients. Adjusting for age, sex, weight, race, respective baseline motor score, surgical intervention, injury level, ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade, education, and insurance status, there was no association with improvement in discharge ASIA motor function or FIM motor score among MP recipients: -0.34 (95% CI, -2.8, 2.1) and 0.75 (95% CI, -2.8, 4.3), respectively. Adjusting for age, sex, race, weight, injury level, and receipt of surgery, no association with increased risk of infection or GI complications was observed. This retrospective cohort study involving patients with acute TSCI observed no short-term improvements in motor function among MP recipients compared with nonrecipients.

In the current study, 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone was injected into rats with spinal cord injury immediately post-injury and at 1 and 2 days post-injury. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores showed that methylprednisolone treatment significantly promoted locomotor functional recovery between 2 and 6 weeks post-injury. The number of surviving motor neurons increased, whereas the lesion size significantly decreased following methylprednisolone treatment at 7 days post-injury. Additionally, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax protein expression levels and the number of apoptotic cells were reduced at 3 and 7 days post-injury, while Bcl-2 levels at 7 days post-injury were higher in methylprednisolone-treated rats compared with saline-treated rats. At 3 and 7 days post-injury, methylprednisolone up-regulated expression and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-6 phosphorylation, β-catenin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation.

Because of the complexity and diversity of the inflammatory process after spinal cord injury, a single drug cannot completely inhibit inflammation. Therefore, we assumed that a combination of methylprednisolone and rosiglitazone might promote recovery of neurological function after secondary spinal cord injury.

Because of their potent anti-inflammatory effects, they have been introduced in multiple sclerosis (MS). Investigation has shown not only an anti-inflammatory, but also supposed neuroprotective mechanism of action. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in a mouse model of traumatic SCI. SCI was produced by extradural compression for 1 min of the spinal cord at the T6-7 level using an aneurysm clip, and DMF and MMF (both at 30 mg/kg) were administered by oral gavage to the mice 1 and 6 h after SCI. For locomotor activity, study mice were treated with FAEs once daily for 10 days. We observed that mice treated with DMF exhibited a significant and sustained recovery of motor function. FAEs significantly reduced the severity of inflammation by a modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis factors, and increased neutrophic factors such as anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), anti-glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT3). Our results showed important protective effects of DMF in an animal model of SCI, considerably improving recovery of motor function, possibly by reducing the secondary inflammation and tissue injury that characterize this model.

Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 μg 17β-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The only treatment currently available is methylprednisolone, which is widely used and renders limited efficacy in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be developed. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 μg/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 μg was found to be as effective as 100 μg in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI.

Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury. Studies are underway in chronic SCI in a follow up manuscript.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

This study aimed to identify ways to reduce the usage and risk of high doses of glucocorticoid steroids, and determine whether AD-MSCs could be used as an early alternative treatment modality for acute SCI. Sixteen adult beagle dogs with SCI were assigned to four treatment groups: control, MPSS, AD-MSCs, and AD-MSCs + MPSS. Additionally, one dog was used to evaluate the distribution of AD-MSCs in the body after injection. AD-MSCs (1 × 10(7) cells) were injected intravenously once a day for 3 days beginning at 6 hours post-SCI. MPSS was also injected intravenously according to the standard protocol for acute SCI. A revised Tarlov scale was used to evaluate hindlimb functional recovery. The levels of markers for oxidative metabolism (3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl) and inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were also measured. At 7 days post-treatment, hindlimb movement had improved in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; however, subjects in the groups treated with MPSS exhibited gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed fewer hemorrhages and lesser microglial infiltration in the AD-MSCs group. The green fluorescent protein-expressing AD-MSCs were clearly detected in the lung, spleen, and injured spinal cord; however, these cells were not detected in the liver and un-injured spinal cord. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine were decreased in the MPSS and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; 4-hydroxynenonal and cyclooxygenase-2 levels were decreased in all treatment groups; and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator transcription 3 levels were decreased in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups. Our results suggest that early intravenous injection of AD-MSCs after acute SCI may prevent further damage through enhancement of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, without inducing adverse effects. Additionally, this treatment could also be used as an alternative intravenous treatment modality for acute SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Pooled evidence does not demonstrate a significant long-term benefit for MPS in patients with acute TSCIs and suggests it may be associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding.

The purpose of this project was to investigate the early dynamic changes and MP's efficacy on axonal damage, blood flow, and calcium influx into axons in a mouse SCI model. YFP H-line and Thy1-GCaMP transgenic mice were used in this study. Two-photon microscopy was used for imaging of axonal dieback, blood flow, and calcium influx post-injury. We found that MP treatment attenuated progressive damage of axons, increased blood flow, and reduced calcium influx post-injury. Furthermore, microglia/macrophages accumulated in the lesion site after SCI and expressed the proinflammatory mediators iNOS, MCP-1 and IL-1β. MP treatment markedly inhibited the accumulation of microglia/macrophages and reduced the expression of the proinflammatory mediators. MP treatment also improved the recovery of behavioral function post-injury. These findings suggest that MP exerts a neuroprotective effect on SCI treatment by attenuating progressive damage of axons, increasing blood flow, reducing calcium influx, and inhibiting the accumulation of microglia/macrophages after SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The present study examined the effects of meglumine cyclic adenylate (MCA) on neurological recovery, cAMP concentration, adenylate cyclase 3 (AC3) activity and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) activity during early stage acute spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. A total of 48 Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly assigned to groups A, B or C, each consisting of 16 animals. SCI was induced by Allen's method using a 7 g x 3 cm extradural weight‑drop impact on spinal cord segment T11. A total of 30 min following SCI, group A received a single 30 mg/kg‑bw i.p. dose of methylprednisolone, group B received 2 mg/kg‑bw i.p. MCA daily for seven days and group C were administered an equal volume of normal saline. Seven days following SCI, the spinal cord samples from eight rats per group were obtained to measure the cAMP concentration, and the activities of AC3 and PDE4D. The remaining eight rats per group were used for behavioral assessments using the inclined plane stability test and Gale scale for up to six weeks post‑SCI. The drug‑treated groups A and B had higher cAMP concentrations and AC3 activities but lower PDE4D activities at the lesion sites, as well as superior behavioral scores post‑SCI compared with the vehicle‑treated group C (P<0.05). Furthermore, cAMP was higher in group B than in group A (P<0.05). It was concluded that MCA may serve as an effective SCI treatment by activating AC3 and suppressing PDE4D.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

We evaluated the ASIA motor score and the AIS grade elevation between the time of treatment and 3-month follow-up and adverse events. The ΔASIA motor score was significantly higher in the G-CSF group than in the MPSS group (p < 0.01). When we compared AIS grade elevation in patients with AIS grades B/C incomplete paralysis, 17.9% of patients in the G-CSF group had an AIS grade elevation of two steps compared to 0% of patients in the MPSS group (p < 0.05), and the incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in the MPSS group (42.9%) compared to the G-CSF group (8.3%) (p < 0.05).

Aminoguanidine (AG), a small water-soluble compound, is potentially useful in the treatment of acute SCI. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of MP and AG, administered in combination, following SCI in adult rats. In rats with SCI, the combination therapy group treated with AG (75 mg/kg) and MP (0.75 mg/kg) exhibited significantly reduced levels of cytokine expression and cell apoptosis compared with those in the control group. In addition, the data demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly enhanced the recovery of limb function.

Although some aspects of the immune response are beneficial, it is thought that leukocyte recruitment and activation in the acute phase of injury results in the production of cytotoxic substances that are harmful to the nervous tissue. Therefore, suppression of excessive inflammation in the spinal cord could serve as a therapeutic strategy to attenuate tissue damage. The immunosuppressant methylprednisolone has been used in the setting of SCI, but there are complications which have attenuated the initial enthusiasm. Hence, there is interest in other immunomodulatory approaches, such as intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIg). Importantly, IVIg is used clinically for the treatment of several auto-immune neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIPD) and Kawasaki disease, with a good safety profile. Thus, it is a promising treatment candidate for SCI. Indeed, IVIg has been shown by our team to attenuate the immune response and result in improved neurobehavioral recovery following cervical SCI in rats through a mechanism that involves the attenuation of neutrophil recruitment and reduction in the levels of cytokines and cytotoxic enzymes Nguyen et al. (J Neuroinflammation 9:224, 2012). Here we review published data in the context of relevant mechanisms of action that have been proposed for IVIg in other conditions. We hope that this discussion will trigger future research to provide supporting evidence for the efficiency and detailed mechanisms of action of this promising drug in the treatment of SCI, and to facilitate its clinical translation.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Apoptosis and autophagy were examined with TUNEL staining and electron microscopy. Hind limb function was assessed by the Gale scale. The expression of the apoptosis-related protein caspase-3 did not significantly increase until 21 days following injury, while increases in LC3II and LC3I began 10 days after injury, but then declined. TUNEL staining and electron microscopy confirmed that following injury autophagy occurred before apoptosis, but by 14 days after the injury, the level of autophagy had decreased significantly while the level of apoptosis showed a continued increase. Following treatment with rapamycin, apoptosis was significantly higher than in the vehicle control group, but significantly lower than in the sham-operated group, showing a protective effect of rapamycin. Gale scale grades in rats treated with rapamycin were significantly higher compared with the vehicle control group, suggesting a functional effect of rapamycin-induced inhibition of apoptosis.

Chitosan and ferulic acid are strong neuroprotective agents but their systemic delivery is difficult. Our data has shown a prolonged circulation time of the FA-GC nanoparticles allowing for effective delivery of both chitosan and ferulic acid to the injured site. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were found both in the gray matter and white matter. The in vitro tests demonstrated that nanoparticles protected primary neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Using a spinal cord contusion injury model, significant recovery in locomotor function was observed in rats that were intravenously administered nanoparticles at 2 h post injury, as compared to non-improvement by methylprednisolone administration. Histological analysis revealed that FA-GC treatment significantly preserved axons and myelin and also reduced cavity volume, astrogliosis, and inflammatory response at the lesion site. No obvious adverse effects of nanoparticles to other organs were found. The restorative effect of FA-GC presents a promising potential for treating human SCIs.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The SCI animals were randomly assigned to five groups: sham control group, SCI model group, the methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) group, the 10 mg/kg apigenin treatment group and the 20 mg/kg apigenin treatment group. First, neuronal function after SCI was evaluated with Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) and the result showed that injured animals treated with apigenin showed a significant increase in BBB scores. To explore the underlying mechanism, antioxidative effect of apigenin was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities after SCI. Apigenin treatment reversed the decrease of SOD and GSH-Px activity, and the increase of MDA level caused by SCI, suggesting its antioxidative role in response to the injury. In addition, apigenin treatment decreased serum interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 release after SCI, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin. Finally, apigenin treatment affected the expression level of apoptosis-related gene Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3, which indicated its antiapoptosis role after SCI.

Three days post-injury, animals were randomized and received intraspinal injections of either HSSC, media-only, or no injections. All animals were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone acetate from the day of cell grafting and survived for eight weeks. Motor and sensory dysfunction were periodically assessed using open field locomotion scoring, thermal/tactile pain/escape thresholds and myogenic motor evoked potentials. The presence of spasticity was measured by gastrocnemius muscle resistance and electromyography response during computer-controlled ankle rotation. At the end-point, gait (CatWalk), ladder climbing, and single frame analyses were also assessed. Syrinx size, spinal cord dimensions, and extent of scarring were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Differentiation and integration of grafted cells in the host tissue were validated with immunofluorescence staining using human-specific antibodies. Intraspinal grafting of HSSC led to a progressive and significant improvement in lower extremity paw placement, amelioration of spasticity, and normalization in thermal and tactile pain/escape thresholds at eight weeks post-grafting. No significant differences were detected in other CatWalk parameters, motor evoked potentials, open field locomotor (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotion score (BBB)) score or ladder climbing test. Magnetic resonance imaging volume reconstruction and immunofluorescence analysis of grafted cell survival showed near complete injury-cavity-filling by grafted cells and development of putative GABA-ergic synapses between grafted and host neurons. Peri-acute intraspinal grafting of HSSC can represent an effective therapy which ameliorates motor and sensory deficits after traumatic spinal cord injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The theory that SCI can induce tumor necrosis factor-α expression at the injury site has been evaluated. However, there are few data to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of infliximab combinated with MP in the treatment of rat SCI METHODS: One hundred eighty adult male Sprague Dawley rats with 280 to 300 g body weight were allocated randomly and accordingly. We applied Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan locomotor rating scale to assess the hindlimb motor functional score (10 rats × 6 groups), the hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry stain (10 rats × 6 groups) to assay the morphological changes of spinal cord, the arrangement and expressions of NF-κB, TRADD and FADD, and the RT-PCR (10 rats × 6 groups) to evaluate the messenger RNA expressions of NF-κB, TRADD, and FADD. The results showed that both infliximab and MP could lower the expressions of NF-κB, TRADD, and FADD 24 hours after the ASCI, and increased Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan score on the 14th and the 21st days after ASCI, suggesting possible neuroprotective effectiveness on attenuating the severity of neurological deficits and improving the locomotor function in the rat ASCI model. Moreover, infliximab combined with MP exhibited the more powerful ability to this amelioration. Infliximab combined with methylprednisolone may be an effective treatment for the recovery of ASCI. Further study is needed to determine if this neuroprotective effect is seen for long-term outcomes especially in human ASCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The study population was divided into 'non-alcohol' (BAC equal to 0‰), 'legal' (BAC greater than 0 up to 0.8‰) and 'illegal' (BAC greater than 0.8‰) subgroups. Outcome measures included survival, NASCIS motor and sensory scores, NASCIS pain scores and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) determinants at baseline and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-SCI. Analyses were adjusted for major potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, trial protocol, Glasgow coma score, and cause, level and severity of SCI. Among 499 patients (423 males and 76 females; ages from 14 to 92 years), the mean BAC was 0.054 ± 0.006‰ (range 0-1). The survival at 1 year (94.4%) was not associated with the BAC (P = 0.374). Moreover, BAC was not significantly correlated with motor recovery (P > 0.166), sensory recovery (P > 0.323), change in pain score (P > 0.312) or functional recovery (P > 0.133) at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-SCI.

Because of its controversial beneficial effects, the combination of MP and other pharmacological agents aimed at enhancing functional recovery is desirable. The phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram has been implicated in promotion of regeneration due to elevating cAMP. In the present study, we sought to determine the effects of MP and rolipram, administered in combination, after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats. Here we show that in vitro administration of rolipram and MP significantly increased neuron survival and promoted neurite outgrowth of neurons on the inhibitory substrate CSPGs by upregulation of MMP-2 expression; in vivo administration of rolipram and MP inhibited CSPG expression and increase CSPG digestion after rat SCI. Rolipram and MP combining treatment promoted significant neuroprotection through reduced motoneuron death, minimized lesion cavity, and increased regeneration of lesioned corticospinal tract (CST) axons beyond the lesion site after SCI. Enhanced functional recovery was also observed. Overall, our study strongly suggested that the combination treatment of MP and rolipram may represent a promising strategy for clinically applicable pharmacological therapy for rapid initiation of neuroprotection after SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Removal of reactive species may reduce secondary damage following SCI. This study explored the effectiveness of a catalytic antioxidant - Mn (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) - in removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress, and improving functional recovery in vivo in a rat impact SCI model. The efficiency of MnTBAP was also compared with that of methylprednisolone - the only drug used clinically in treating acute SCI. In vivo measurements of time courses of ROS production by microdialysis and microcannula sampling in MnTBAP, methylprednisolone, and saline (as vehicle control)-treated SCI rats showed that both agents significantly reduced the production of hydrogen peroxide, but only MnTBAP significantly reduced superoxide elevation after SCI. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that MnTBAP scavenged both of the preceding ROS, whereas methylprednisolone had no effect on either. By counting the immuno-positive neurons in the spinal cord sections immunohistochemically stained with anti-nitrotyrosine and anti-4-hydroxy-nonenal antibodies as the markers of protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation, we demonstrated that MnTBAP significantly reduced the numbers of 4-hydroxy-nonenal-positive and nitrotyrosine-positive neurons in the sections at 1.55 to 2.55 mm and 1.1 to 3.1 mm, respectively, rostral to the injury epicenter compared to the vehicle-treated animals. By behavioral tests (open field and inclined plane tests), we demonstrated that at 4 hours post-SCI treatment with MnTBAP and the standard methylprednisolone regimen both significantly increased test scores compared to those produced by vehicle treatment. However, the outcomes for MnTBAP-treated rats were significantly better than those for methylprednisolone-treated animals. This study demonstrated for the first time in vivo and in vitro that MnTBAP significantly reduced the levels of SCI-elevated ROS and that MnTBAP is superior to methylprednisolone in removing ROS. Removal of ROS by MnTBAP significantly reduced protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation in neurons. MnTBAP more effectively reduced neurological deficits than did methylprednisolone after SCI - the first most important criterion for assessing SCI treatments. These results support the therapeutic potential of MnTBAP in treating SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

A rat model of acute SCI was established using the modified Allen's method. At 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 14 days after injury, injured T10 spinal cord specimens were harvested. GB significantly increased inclined plane test scores and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale scores in SCI rats from postoperative day 3 to day 14. The effect was equal to that of the positive control drug, MP. Western blot analysis showed that JAK(2) was significantly phosphorylated from 4 h after SCI, peaked at 12 h and gradually decreased thereafter, accompanied by phosphorylation of STAT(3) with a similar time course. GB was shown to significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of JAK(2) and STAT(3) in rats with SCI. It significantly increased the ratio of B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) protein expression at 24 h, led to an obvious down-regulation of caspase-3 gene and protein expression at 3 days, and significantly decreased the cell apoptosis index at each time point after SCI. This effect was similar to that obtained with the JAK-specific inhibitor, AG490. Our experimental findings indicated that GB can protect rats against acute SCI, and that its underlying mechanism may be related to the inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation, improvement of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, decreased caspase-3 gene and protein expression and further inhibition of secondary cell apoptosis following SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

At 24 h post-SCI, there was a massive loss of motor function and cysts formation in the spinal cord. The SCI mice, following 3 days and onwards, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the population and hypertrophy of GFAP + astrocytes, suggesting the occurrence of reactive astrogliosis. Intra-fourth ventricular administration of CART (54-102) or intravenous treatment with MP, dose dependently improved motor function score, while CART-antibody (intra-fourth ventricular) was ineffective. This neuroprotective effect of MP was potentiated by the subeffective dose of CART and antagonized by CART-antibody. CART or MP treatment not only prevented the cysts formation, but also significantly attenuated the population of GFAP + astrocytes at days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-SCI and the hypertrophy of astrocytes at day 14 and 28. The histological consequence of SCI, like cysts formation in the spinal cord, was rapidly improved by CART and/or MP. Taken together, the data suggest that CART may exert its neuroprotective effect via inhibition of post-SCI astrogliosis and participate in the MP mediated neuroprotection.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Although neurological deficit is usually related to the severity of spinal injury, this is different in spinal cord concussion. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate a group of 24 patients with spinal cord concussion, to design a diagnostic algorithm and propose an effective therapy with a good prognosis for the patients. We reviewed clinical records of 9 768 patients hospitalised at the Department of Spinal Surgery, University Hospital in Motol, from September 2002 till December 2010, and of 457 patients treated at other departments of the Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010; this was a total of 10 225 patients. The data were retrospectively analysed and only the patients with a clear history of trauma and subsequent conservative therapy were selected to comprise a group characterised by the generally known criteria of spinal cord concussion: (1) spinal injury with immediate neurological deficit of varying degree; (2) neurological deficit corresponding to the level of spinal injury; (3) recovery of neurological function within 72 hours of injury; (4) no morphological evidence of injury to the spinal structures obtained by imaging methods. This group comprised 24 patients. The patients were followed up from 6 to 95 months, with a mean of 46 months and a median of 48 months, at intervals of 6 and 12 weeks and 6 and 12 months after injury, and then every following year. The recorded information included the patient's age at the time of injury, their gender, the mechanism of injury, reports on alcohol consumption, the first detected neurological deficit, its development immediately after injury, during the hospital stay and at follow-ups in the out-patient department, methylprednisolone administration according to the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) 2, and findings of imaging methods, particularly MRI. Our group consisted of 22 men (91.7%) and two women (8.3%), with an average age of 29 years; the average age was 30 years in men and 18.5 years in women. Seven patients (29.2%) were younger than 18 years, with an average of 16.14 years; the remaining 17 patients (70.8%) were older than 18 years, with an average of 34.35 years. The major mechanisms of injury included falls from a height in 10 patients (41.7%) and injury due to alcohol consumption in five patients (20.1%). Clinical findings involved lesions of the medullary cone in 12 (50.0%), cervical spinal cord in seven (29.2%) and thoracic spinal cord in five (20.8%) patients. Motor function deficit was present in all patients, of whom 10 (41.2%) showed a complete loss of motor function. Impaired sensory function was found in 21 (87.5%) patients. One patient had perianal and genital sensory deficit and one (4.2%) had urinary retention. Neither radiograms nor CT scans showed traumatic changes in any of the patients; MRI findings free of any traumatic spinal changes were recorded in 21 patients (87.5%). One patient had oedema of the T5 and T8 vertebral bodies. No complications were recorded. All patients experienced rapid resolution of neurological deficit, which occurred within 6 hours of injury in two (8.4%), within 12 hours in two (8.4%), within 24 hours in 12 (50.0%) and within 48 hours in six (25.0%) patients, and later than 48 hours after injury in two patients (8.4%). However, recovery always occurred within 72 hours of injury. A good prognosis for patients with this injury is supported by our findings, because all patients experienced rapid resolution of neurological deficit within 72 hours of injury. This result is in agreement with the relevant international studies reporting no serious complications associated with spinal trauma. There are no clear recommendations for administration of high doses of methylprednisolone according to the NASCIS system. Spinal cord concussion is not a frequent injury; in our study, it accounted for 3.54% of the patients with trauma histories out of the total number of 678 patients, or for 2.40% out of 997 injured spinal levels. The first steps should be the same as in any other injury to the spinal cord. An early examination of the patient with imaging methods including MRI is of primary importance. At present administration of methylprednisolone according to the NASCIS system is disputable. The patient diagnosed with spinal cord concussion has a good prognosis, with rehabilitation as the main therapeutic approach.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Forty adult Wistar albino rats were randomized into five groups: control, SCI alone (50 g/cm weight drop), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) (30 mg/kg), curcumin + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (300 mg/kg), and DMSO alone (0.1 mg/kg). Administration of curcumin significantly decreased LPO in first 24 hours. However, there were no differences in the neurological scores of injured rats between the medication groups and the control group. Curcumin was more effective than DMSO and MPSS in reducing LPO, whereas DMSO was more effective than curcumin and MPSS in minimizing ultrastuctural changes. The results of this study indicate that curcumin exerts a beneficial effect by decreasing LPO and may reduce tissue damage. Since ultrastructural and neurological findings does not support biochemical finding, our findings do not exclude the possibility that curcumin has a protective effect on the spinal cord ultrastructure and neurological recovery after SCI. A combination of curcumin with other vehicle may also have a considerable synergy in protecting spinal cord.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Failure to adhere to certain guiding principles can be detrimental to the long-term neurologic and functional outcome of these patients. Therapy for the hyperacute phase of traumatic SCI focuses on stabilizing vital signs and follows the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) algorithm for ensuring stability of airway, breathing and circulation, and disability (neurologic evaluation)-with spinal stabilization-and exposure. Spinal stabilization, with cervical collars and long backboards, is used to prevent movement of a potentially unstable spinal column injury to prevent further injury to the spinal cord and nerve roots, especially during prehospital transport. Surgery to stabilize the spine is undertaken after life-threatening injuries (hemorrhage, evacuation of intracranial hemorrhage, acute vascular compromise) are addressed. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission is to be considered for all patients with high SCI or hemodynamic instability, as well as those with other injuries that independently warrant ICU admission. Avoidance of hypotension and hypoxia may minimize secondary neurologic injury. Elevating the mean arterial pressure above 85 mmHg for 7 days should be considered, to allow for spinal cord perfusion. The use of intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone) is controversial. Early tracheostomy in patients with lesions above C5 may reduce the number of ventilator days and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Select patients may benefit from the placement of a diaphragmatic pacer. Aggressive measures, including CoughAssist and Intermittent Positive Pressure Breaths (IPPB), should be used to maintain lung recruitment and aid in the mobilization of secretions. Some patients with high SCI who are dependent on mechanical ventilation can eventually be liberated from the ventilator with consistent efforts from both the patient and the caregiver, along with some patience. Intermittent catheterization by the patient or a caregiver may be associated with a lower incidence of urinary tract infections, compared with an in-dwelling urinary catheter. Early mobilization of patients and a multidisciplinary approach (including respiratory therapists, nutritional experts, physical therapists, and occupational therapists) can streamline care and may improve long-term outcomes. A number of investigational drugs and therapies offer hope of neurologic recovery for some patients.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Our aim was to retrospectively assess this application in a cohort of patients with spinal cord injury. Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 1997 and 2007 with a diagnosis of spinal cord injury due to trauma. The patients were grouped according to medical treatment received into a methylprednisolone group and a no-methylprednisolone group. We assessed change in neurologic function on the impairment scale of the American Spinal Injury Association on ICU admission and on discharge. We also recorded medical complications in each group. Cox multiple regression analysis was used to analyze differences between treatments. No significant differences were detected in neurologic outcome on discharge from the ICU (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-3.54). The methylprednisolone-treated patients had more medical complications such as hyperglycemia (OR, 5.67; 95% CI, 1.85-17.31) or gastrointestinal bleeding (OR, 19.16; 95% CI, 1.64-223.30) than the patients who did not receive methylprednisolone. In this retrospective study, methylprednisolone was unrelated to improvement in neurologic outcome after acute spinal cord injury on ICU discharge although the patients treated with this drug were at greater risk of metabolic complications.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Files of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) were reviewed (NASCIS was founded in 1977 and has tracked trials in this area since that date). We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and previously published reviews. All randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. One review author extracted data from trial reports. Japanese and French studies were found through NASCIS and additional data (e.g. SDs) were obtained from the original study authors. Eight trials are included in this review, seven used methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post-injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg over 15 minutes, with maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial results were replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data was obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This indicated significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy, when administration commenced within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that, if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status are observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries. A modified regimen was found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. The risk of bias was low in the largest methyprednisolne trials. Overall, there was no evidence of significantly increased complications or mortality from the 23 or 48 hour therapy. High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. One trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. There is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacologic therapy for acute spinal cord injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a major public health issue in developed countries as well as worldwide. The pathophysiology of SCI is characterized by an initial primary injury followed by secondary deterioration. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of SCI remain to be fully understood, it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress have a significant role in the pathophysiology of SCI. Thus, alleviating oxidative stress may be an effective strategy for therapeutic intervention of SCI. The aim of this review was to describe (i) the sources of ROS as well as the major antioxidant defenses with particular attention being paid to lipid peroxidation; (ii) the biomarkers of oxidative stress in SCI and (iii) the neuroprotective effects of various compounds with antioxidative properties in animal models of SCI. PubMed, one of the most comprehensive biomedical databases, was searched from 1976-2011. All relevant papers were read by title, abstract and full-length article. Oxidative stress is considered a hallmark of injury of SCI. Thus, alleviating oxidative stress may be an effective way of therapeutic intervention of SCI. Two of these agents, the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone and the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad, have been shown to possess significant antioxidant activities and improve recovery of SCI patients in clinical trials. Other promising botanical compounds and their molecular targets and mechanisms of action with regard to potential protection against SCI were also described. These include carotenoids and phenolic compounds. ROS and oxidative stress have a significant role in the pathophysiology of SCI. Alleviating oxidative stress is be an effective strategy for therapeutic intervention of SCI. Extensive research over the past several decades has identified numerous bioactive compounds that have antioxidative stress benefits in animal models of SCI. Thus, continued studies on bioactive compounds with ROS-scavenging capacity may lead to the development of effective antioxidant-based modalities for treating SCI in human subjects.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

To evaluate the efficacy and active components of a previously described epidural analgesic paste in controlling postoperative pain and facilitating early discharge from hospital after lumbar decompressive surgery. A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted. Two-hundred and one patients were randomized to 1 of 4 analgesic epidural pastes at the time of lumbar spinal surgery: combination paste (morphine + methylprednisolone), steroid paste (methylprednisolone alone), morphine paste (morphine alone), or placebo. The primary outcome measures used were analgesic consumption and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Secondary outcome measures were: modified American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) score, Short Form 36 General Health Survey (SF-36), Aberdeen Pain Index (ABPI), time to ambulation and time to discharge from hospital. Administration of combination and steroid paste, but not morphine paste, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI) components of the MPQ in the first 3 days after surgery. Likewise, postoperative in-patient narcotic analgesic consumption was reduced in the combination paste and steroid paste group, but not in the morphine paste group. No difference in time to ambulation or discharge, SF-36 scores, ABPI scores, or neurologic recovery was observed. An analgesic paste containing methylprednisolone acetate is effective at reducing postoperative pain after lumbar decompressive surgery. Mixing effective doses of morphine sulfate in the paste abrogates the expected analgesic effects of epidural morphine.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Methylprednisolone, the only currently available therapy renders limited protection in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be tested to maximize neuroprotection and functional recovery. Previous data from our laboratory indicate that estrogen (17β-estradiol) at a high dose may attenuate multiple damaging pathways involved in SCI and improve locomotor outcome. Since use of high dose estrogen may have detrimental side effects and therefore may never be used in the clinic, the current study investigated the efficacy of this steroid hormone at very low doses in SCI. In particular, we tested the impact of dosing (1-10 μg/kg), mode of delivery (intravenous vs. osmotic pump), and delay in estrogen application (15 min-4 h post-SCI) on microgliosis and neuronal death in acute SCI in rats. Treatment with 17β-estradiol (1-10 μg/kg) significantly reduced microglial activation and also attenuated apoptosis of neurons compared to untreated SCI animals. The attenuation of cell death and inflammation by estrogen was observed regardless of mode and time of delivery following injury. These findings suggest estrogen as a potential agent for the treatment of individuals with SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Although irradiation carries the risk of secondary SCI, it has been effective for the regeneration of the axons of nerve cells by reducing gliosis. Thus, to minimize apoptosis and irradiation risks after SCI, this study investigated the effects of steroid injections before irradiation. Thirty-two rats were used for the experimental procedure. After a traumatic SCI, they were divided into 4 groups of 8 rats each: (1) a control group that only had rats with a SCI (Group 1); (2) a group that received MP at 30 minutes, 6 hours and 24 hours, and then received irradiation 2 days after the SCI (Group 2); (3) a group that received MP at 30 minutes, and irradiation 2 days after the SCI (Group 3); and (4) a group that received irradiation 2 days after the traumatic SCI (Group 4). The degree of recovery using the inclined plane climbing test was greatest in Group 2, followed by Group 3, Group 4, and Group 1. The cavitation lesions, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling -positive apoptosis, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocyte count, and CC-1-positive oligodendrocyte count significantly decreased in the irradiated groups (Groups 2, 3, 4) compared to the control group (Group 1). In particular, they decreased considerably more in the group that received MP 3 times (Group 2) compared to the group that received MP only once (Group 3).

The concentrations of cGMP in the spinal cord are controlled by the actions of PDE. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the effects of the use of both methylprednisolone and tadalafil on serum and tissue concentrations of NO, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and tissue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in Wistar albino rats by dropping a 10 g rod from a 5.0 cm height at T8-10. The 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: tadalafil, methylprednisolone, non-treatment and sham groups. Rats were neurologically tested at 24 hours after trauma. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p<0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p<0.05). The increase in serum SOD levels was greater in the tadalafil group than the methylprednisolone group. Serum MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group (p>0.05). Tissue MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group and sham groups (p>0.05). Although there was no difference in neurological outcome scores between the tadalafil, methylprednisolone and non-treatment groups (p>0.05), the animals in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to have better scores than the non-treatment group.

During 2-year, all patients with cervical cord injury were treated with MPSS within 8 hours of their injuries based on the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study protocol (MPSS group).

In patients with complete motor loss, average ASIA motor score improved 9.0 points in the MPSS group and 12.6 points in the non-MPSS group. For patients with incomplete motor loss, average ASIA motor score improvement was 14.1 and 15.5 points in the MPSS and non-MPSS groups, respectively.In the MPSS group, 19 patients developed pneumonia, 13 developed urinary tract infections, and 5 developed wound infections. Incidence of pneumonia was significantly increased with the use of MPSS medication. We found no evidence supporting the opinion that high-dose MPSS administration facilitates neurologic improvement in patients with spinal cord injury. We believe MPSS should be used under limited circumstances because of the high incidence of pulmonary complication.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

However, many have questioned the efficacy of MPSS because of its marginal effects. Additionally there has been criticism of both study design and statistical interpretation. The functional consequences of experimental SCI have been assessed in many ways. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of MPSS vs. saline solution (SS) following moderate T10 contusion injury in rat. Functional recovery was evaluated using the 21-point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor recovery scale, the inclined plane, the beam walk, footprint analysis and the horizontal ladder. To optimize the precision and accuracy of functional results we examined the locomotion on a treadmill using three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Stereology was used to estimate the amount of damaged tissue. The results of the traditional functional methods showed that administration of the NASCIS dosage of MPSS following acute spinal cord contusion did not lead to any significant differences in the functional recovery of MPSS- vs. SS-treated animals. More importantly, the results of the 3D kinematic showed that the MPSS administration did not affect the flexion/extension of the hip, knee and ankle joints during the step cycle. Finally, stereological results revealed no statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups. Altogether, our results support data previously reported by several authors, suggesting that MPSS does not lead to improved functional outcome following experimental acute SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

In order to prove if early metabolic reactivation is a better therapeutic option than antioxidant therapy in the acute phase of TSCI, spinal cord contusions were performed in adult rats using a well-characterized weight drop technique at thoracic 9 level. After TSCI, pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase (NDC) enzyme was used to maintain energy levels, antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and catalase (ANT) were used to decrease oxidative damage and methylprednisolone (MP), which has both therapeutic properties, was used as a control. Rats were divided into one sham group and six with TSCI; one of them received no treatment, and the rest were treated with NDC, MP, NDC + MP, NDC + ANT or ANT. The ANT group decreased lactate and creatine phosphokinase levels and increased the amount of preserved tissue (morphometric analysis) as well as functional recovery (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan or BBB motor scale). In contrast, NDC treatment increased lipid peroxidation, measured through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, as well as spinal cord tissue destruction and functional deficit. Early metabolic reactivation after a TSCI may be deleterious, while natural early metabolic inhibition may not be a ""secondary mechanism of injury"" but a ""secondary neuroprotective response"". While increased antioxidant defence after a TSCI may currently be an ideal therapeutic strategy, the usefulness of metabolic reactivation should be tested in the sub-acute or chronic phases of TSCI and new strategies must continue to be tested for the early ones.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The paper reviews current knowledge concerning the sequence of biochemical events in the injured spinal cord and gives an overview of therapeutic possibilities for preventing the spread of secondary injury. The literature survey has led to the following conclusions: 1. The primary zone of traumatic damage enlarges due to local vascular disturbances, hypoxia, and the resulting inflammation. 2. Inflammation in the region of secondary injury, apart from having a destructive impact, is the source of substances which may induce neural tissue repair. 3. The administration of methylprednisolone and surgical decompression of the spinal cord within several hours after SCI improves functional and neurological outcomes in patients with incomplete neurological deficits.

The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) motor score was evaluated weekly, beginning on postinjury Day 1. After 4 weeks, the rats' spinal cords were evaluated histologically to determine myelin index and gross white matter sparing. A second experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of delayed administration (8, 12, or 24 hours postinjury) of magnesium on recovery. The mean BBB scores at 4 weeks showed that rats in which magnesium was administered (BBB Score 6.9 +/- 3.9) recovered better than controls (4.2 +/- 2.0, p < 0.01). Insufficient numbers of animals receiving methylprednisolone were available for analysis because of severe weight loss. The rats given magnesium within 8 hours of injury had better motor recovery at 4 weeks than control animals (13.8 +/- 3.7 vs 8.6 +/- 5.1, p < 0.01) or animals in which magnesium was administered at 12 or 24 hours after injury (p < 0.01). Steroids (30.2%), magnesium (32.3%), and a combination of these (42.3%) had a significant effect on white matter sparing (p < 0.05), but the effect was not synergistic (p > 0.8). Neither steroids nor magnesium had a significant effect on the myelin index (p > 0.1). The rats receiving magnesium had significantly better BBB motor scores and white matter sparing 4 weeks after moderate-to-severe SCI than control animals. In addition, the groups given steroids only or magnesium and steroids had improved white matter sparing, although the limited numbers of animals reaching the study end point makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the utility of steroids in this model. The optimal timing of magnesium administration appears to be within 8 hours of injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Our purpose was to explore emergency department (ED) response to this shifting information by assessing the impact of NASCIS and the 2002 report on MPSS protocols and to study factors associated with MPSS administration. Availability of protocols and hospital characteristics were determined by survey of all hospitals with EDs in South Carolina. Protocol copies were obtained and reviewed for accuracy based on NASCIS. Patient hospital discharge information was collected through the state Office of Research and Statistics, and factors associated with receiving MPSS were evaluated using multivariable techniques. Having a protocol was associated with trauma level designation and volume of traumatic spinal cord injury patients per annum, with 100% of Level I trauma facilities having a protocol. Across all trauma levels, 40% of reporting EDs had an MPSS protocol, with 86% of these accurate, and none withdrawn during the study. Patient factors associated with being less likely to receive MPSS were female gender, injury below thoracic level, and treatment in an undesignated trauma center.

To develop magnesium into a clinically relevant therapy for SCI, further refinement and improvement of the magnesium formulation is necessary. In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007). We established that the 254 micromol/kg dose of MgCl(2) was superior to 127 micromol/kg MgCl(2) with respect to tissue sparing and locomotor recovery. Additionally, the number of infusions (2, 4, or 6), time between infusions (6 vs 8 hours), and different magnesium salts (MgCl(2) vs MgSO(4)) were evaluated to determine an ""optimal"" treatment regimen. We observed that an ""optimized"" regimen of MgCl(2) within PEG conferred greater tissue neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery compared to methylprednisolone. Further a 4 hour time window of histologic and behavioral efficacy was established. The goal of these experiments was to help guide the treatment parameters for a clinical trial of magnesium within a polyethylene glycol formulation in acute human spinal cord injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Data were extracted from the published articles relating to: outcome; MP dosing regimen; species/strain; number of animals; methodological quality; type of injury induction; use of anaesthesia; functional scale used; and duration of follow-up. Subgroup analyses were performed, based on species or strain, injury method, MP dosing regimen, functional outcome measured, and methodological quality. Sixty-two studies were included, which involved a wide variety of animal species and strains. Overall, beneficial effects of MP administration were obtained in 34% of the studies, no effects in 58%, and mixed results in 8%. The results were inconsistent both among and within species, even when attempts were made to detect any patterns in the results through subgroup analyses. The results of this study demonstrate the barriers to the accurate prediction from animal studies of the effectiveness of MP in the treatment of acute SCI in humans.

Acute spinal cord injury results from both primary damage to the spinal cord at the time of the initial injury as well as a deleterious secondary cascade of events, which leads to further damage. Surgical decompression is known to improve clinical outcomes, but the timing of surgical decompression remains controversial. A nylon tie was used to constrict the spinal cord in 18 adult male beagle dogs. The animals were then prospectively randomized to 3 groups: 1) surgical decompression at 6 hours and intravenous methylprednisolone; 2) surgical decompression at 6 hours and intravenous saline; and 3) intravenous methylprednisolone without surgical decompression. Each animal was evaluated by somatosensory-evoked potentials, daily neurologic assessment, and histologic examination at 2 weeks following injury. Immediately following spinal cord constriction, all animals were paraplegic, incontinent, and the somatosensory-evoked potentials were abolished. Surgical decompression 6 hours after injury, with or without methylprednisolone, led to significantly better neurologic function at 2 weeks than methylprednisolone alone. In the setting of acute and persistent spinal cord compression in beagle dogs, surgical decompression 6 hours after injury, with or without methylprednisolone, is more effective for improving neurologic recovery than methylprednisolone alone.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Demographic and clinical data were collected from the hospital charts. The patients were evaluated at admission for rehabilitation, before discharging, 1 year and 3 years after injury. Neurologic status was registered according to the standards of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and functional status by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The sample population was 87% men, with a mean age of 40 years. Motor vehicle accidents and falls were the commonest mechanism of injury. The majority sustained dorsal and cervical lesions (45% and 42% respectively). The initial management included: intravenous high dose methylprednisolone, administered within eight hours after injury in 54% of the sample; early surgical stabilization, performed on 77%. Incomplete cord injury carried a better prognosis of motor improvement, especially the patients classified as C on the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS). A significant statistical association was found between the outcomes obtained during the initial rehabilitation, and the ones achieved on the 3 year followup period. The neurologic recovery was not related with the patient's age, injury level, high dose steroid administration or surgery performed in the first 24 hours after injury (p >0.05). The FIM scores demonstrated the favourable functional outcomes achieved, especially during the inpatient rehabilitation. The results of this study further demonstrate the considerable potential for neurologic recovery after TSCI, emphasizing the importance of the rehabilitation investment continuity, especially for the ones with incomplete cord injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The findings on admission were compared with those at discharge and at the most recent outpatient follow-up visit. Significant neurologic improvement was defined as increase in at least 1 clinical grade according to the Frankel classification system. Significantly more motor and sensory recovery was noted (complete ASCI, 69% vs 0; incomplete ASCI, 70% vs 50%) in patients treated with surgery and MP than in patients without such treatment. Moreover, 87% (14/16) of patients with complete ASCI (unlike patients with incomplete [8/28, 28.6%] and mild [2/14, 14.3%] ASCI) treated with MP had steroid-related complications, and 1 patient died from sepsis related to a perforated peptic ulcer. Mean hospitalization was significantly shorter for the patients who underwent tracheostomy (49 days, ranged from 22 to 110 days) vs nontracheostomy(94 days, ranged from 28-268 days). Early intervention with surgery and MP is critical. Although treatment with MP for 24 or 48 hours significantly improves motor and sensory function of patients with ASCI, harmful side effects limit its functional efficacy in patients with complete ASCI. Early tracheostomy can shorten hospital stay in patients with complete ASCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Treatment with reparixin significantly counteracts secondary degeneration by reducing oligodendrocyte apoptosis, migration to the injury site of neutrophils and ED-1-positive cells. The observed preservation of the white matter might also be secondary to the enhanced proliferation of NG2-positive cells. The expression of macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 beta was also counteracted, and the proliferation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells was markedly reduced.

Further, to illustrate the impact of SCI only animals did not receive methylprednisolone in order to exclude confounding iatrogenic factors.

To examine the effects of immunomodulator treatment with recombinant human interferon-beta after spinal cord contusion injury. Immunomodulator treatment with interferon-beta has been the subject of extensive studies, but mainly in relation to multiple sclerosis. Recently, it was reported that interferon-beta possessed significant neuroprotection after experimental transient ischemic stroke. However, to our knowledge, there have been no previous reports about the neuroprotective effect of interferon-beta after spinal cord injury. Rats were randomly allocated into 5 groups. Group 1 was control and after clinical examination, normal spinal cord samples were obtained. Group 2 was introduced 50 g/cm contusion injury. Group 3 was vehicle, immediately after trauma 1 mL of physiologic saline was injected. Group 4 was given 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate intraperitoneally immediately after trauma. Group 5 was given 1 x 10(7) IU interferon-beta immediately and 0.5 x 10(7) IU interferon-beta 4 hours after trauma. Animals were examined by inclined plane and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale 24 hours after trauma. Spinal cord samples obtained following clinical evaluations. Neutrophil infiltration was evaluated by myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation was estimated by thiobarbituric acid test. Electron and light microscopic results were also performed to determine the effects of interferon-beta on tissue structure. Interferon-beta treatment improved neurologic outcome, which was supported by decreased myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation. Electron and light microscopic results also showed preservation of tissue structure in the treatment group. Immunomodulator treatment with interferon-beta possesses obvious neuroprotection after acute contusion injury to the rat spinal cord.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Transplantation strategies using sources such as neural stem cells and embryonic spinal cord still have some hurdles to overcome before practical applications become available. We therefore aimed to develop a practical medication for SCI. Per oral treatment with withanoside IV, which was previously shown to regenerate neuronal networks in the brain, improved locomotor functions in mice with SCI. In the spinal cord after SCI, axons were crushed in the white matter and gray matter, and central nervous system (CNS) myelin level decreased. In mice treated with withanoside IV (10micromol/kg body weight/day, for 21 days), axonal density and peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin level increased. The loss of CNS myelin and increase in reactive gliosis were not affected by withanoside IV. These results suggest that oral administration of withanoside IV may ameliorate locomotor functions by facilitating both axonal regrowth and increase in PNS myelin level.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

An annual incidence of 15 to 40 traumatic SCI cases per million population has been reported worldwide, and a conservative estimate for Singapore would be 23 cases per million. With continued improvements in medical care, an increasing prevalence of SCI patients is expected, with corresponding need for comprehensive rehabilitation services led by specialist rehabilitation physicians. A literature search, review, and summary of findings of recent studies relating to factors associated with recovery, as well as interventions for rehabilitation and promotion of healing of the injured spinal cord was performed. Many SCI patients show improvements in motoric and neurologic level, but those with complete injuries have poor chance of improving American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores. SCI of violent aetiology tends to be more neurologic complete, and those without sacral sparing less likely to improve. Older patients generally do well in activities of daily living. Women have better motor score improvement, although men have better Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores generally. Electrodiagnostic tests such as somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) can help with prognostication, as can imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Immediate surgery for spinal decompression may improve recovery, but whether routine surgery after SCI improves function remains unclear, as does the timing. Methylprednisolone and similar agents appear to help limit secondary injury processes. Rehabilitation interventions such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) and body-weight supported treadmill ambulation training may be effective, as may neural-controlled prostheses and devices. Substances that promote repair and regeneration of the injured spinal cord such as GM-1, 4-AP, BDNG, GDNF, Nogo and MAG-inhibitors, have been studied. Transplanted tissues and cells, such as blood macrophages, bone marrow transplant with GM-CSF, olfactory ensheathing cells, fetal tissues, stem or progenitor cells, have been reported to produce neurological improvements.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Seventy patients were included in this study: 37 in the MPSS group who were treated with MPSS within 8 hours of their injury according to the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study protocol, and 33 in non-MPSS group who were not administered with MPSS. Improvements in the American Spinal Injury Association motor score were compared between the MPSS group and the non-MPSS group. In patients with complete motor loss at admission and follow-up periods, improvements of myotomal levels between the MPSS (n = 15) and non-MPSS groups (n = 21) were compared. Early complications within 6 weeks of high-dose MPSS therapy were compared with those of no MPSS therapy.

Specifically, we examined, by morphological and cytochemical methods combined with light, confocal and electron microscopy, i) myelin preservation, ii) activation of adult oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) identified for the expression of NG2 transmembrane proteoglycan, iii) changes in the amount of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans neurocan, versican and phosphacan and of their glycosaminoglycan component labeled with Wisteria floribunda lectin, and iv) ventral horn density of the serotonergic plexus as a marker of descending motor control axons. Injured rats received either saline or a single dose of rhEPO within 30 min after SCI. The results showed that the significant improvement of functional outcome observed in rhEPO-treated rats was associated with a better preservation of myelin in the ventral white matter. Moreover, the significant increase of both the number of NG2-positive OPCs and the labeling for Nogo-A, a marker of differentiated oligodendrocytes, suggested that rhEPO treatment could result in the generation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes. Sparing of fiber tracts in the ventral white matter was confirmed by the increased density of the serotonergic plexus around motor neurons. As for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, only phosphacan, increased in saline-treated rats, returned to normal levels in rhEPO group, probably reflecting a better maintenance of glial-axolemmal relationships along nerve fibers. In conclusion, this investigation expands previous studies supporting the pleiotropic neuroprotective effect of rhEPO on secondary degenerative response and its therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCI and confirms that the preservation of the ventral white matter, which contains descending motor pathways, may be critical for limiting functional deficit.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

By these means CsA may diminish overproduction of free radicals and secondarily, lipid peroxidation (LP), both observed after acute spinal cord (SC) injury. Studies performed on reliable experimental models, using a well-standardized CsA dosing scheme, showed that a low dose of this drug inhibits the expression and activity of constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthases (NOS), two enzymes strongly involved in the production of NO after SCI. Likewise, this compound inhibits LP. This inhibition is equivalent to the one induced by methylprednisolone (MP) at a high dose, but without the deleterious effects of the latter upon the survival of the animals. Moreover, inhibition of LP by CsA significantly correlates with a decrease in the demyelination process at the epicenter of the lesion, a significant survival of neurons in the red nucleus and enhanced motor recovery in animals submitted to a severe SC contusion. CsA acts as a neuroprotector agent after SC injury; hence, this drug may be useful in the treatment of acute SCI. CsA deserves further study in experimental animal models and in humans.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Methylprednisolone (MP) has been considered a standard of care for acute SCI. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of MP, in severe and more moderate severe clip-compression models of SCI, on the measures of neurological function and lesion sparing that we used previously to assess a highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the CD11d integrin. Intravenous treatment with the anti-CD11d mAb blocks the infiltration of leukocytes into the lesion, limits secondary cord damage, and improves neurological outcomes. We also undertook a 2- week study of effects of these two therapies in combination. To permit direct comparison, the new findings with MP are presented together with reference to the previously published effects of the mAb. The severe SCI was at the 4(th) thoracic segment (T4), causing extensive motor dysfunction; the more moderate SCI was at T12 and caused less locomotor loss but the induction of mechanical allodynia. Neither MP alone nor the combination treatment improved Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan 21-point open-field locomotor scores at 2-12 weeks after SCI. These scores were ~4 points in the control, MP, and combination treatment groups, respectively, at 2 weeks after severe SCI at T4. By 6 weeks after T4 SCI, scores in the control and MP groups were ~7. At 12 weeks after the more moderate T12 injury, scores were ~8 in both control and MP treatment groups. MP treatment had no consistent effect on mechanical allodynia during 12 weeks after SCI. Control and MP-treated rats responded to approximately five of 10 stimuli to their backs and three of 10 stimuli to their hind paws. MP treatment increased areas of neurofilament and myelin near the injury site at T4 and T12. Thus, MP treatment spared tissue, but had no corresponding effect on neurological function. In contrast, the combination treatment did not spare myelin significantly. These neurological outcomes after treatment with MP contrast with the consistent and significant improvements after treatment with the anti-CD11d mAb. Effects of MP on the lesion were significant, but myelin sparing was less than that caused by the anti-CD11d mAb. The presence of MP in the combination therapy appeared to reverse the positive effects of the mAb. The poor neurological outcome after MP treatment may relate to the long-lasting reduction in hematogenous monocyte/macrophages within the injury site that it causes and to the prolongation of a neutrophil presence.

During apoptosis dying cells secrete additional mediators of apoptosis such as cytokines and free radicals which have additional toxic effects and exacerbate neuronal death. The aim of this laboratory study was to investigate the effects of mexiletine on caspase-3 activation and functional recovery and compare its post-SCI effectiveness with methylprednisolone. The rats were divided into five groups. Animals in the trauma group underwent traumatic interventions after laminectomy. Spinal cord contusion injury was produced using the weight-drop method. Animals in treatment groups received a single dose of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Group C), single dose of mexiletine (Group D), or vehicle solution (saline; Group E) intraperitoneally immediately after injury. Hind-limb functions were assessed using the inclined plane technique and caspase-3 activity in tissue samples was measured 24 hours after SCI. Traumatic injury was found to increase tissue caspase-3 activity. In both treatment groups the drug prevented an increase in caspase-3 activity. Mexiletine treatment improved early behavioral recovery after SCI. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that mexiletine treatment inhibits caspase-3 activation and preserve/restore better neuronal function compared with methylprednisolone after experimental SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

To evaluate the potential complementarity of these mechanistically distinct pharmacological reagents we compared their effects alone and in combination after thoracic (T7) dorsal hemisection in the rat. Treatment with an ecto-domain of the rat NgR (27-310) fused to a rat IgG [NgR(310)ecto-Fc] (50 microm intrathecal, 0.25 microL/h for 28 days) or MP alone (30 mg/kg i.v., 0, 4 and 8 h postinjury) improved the rate and extent of functional recovery measured using Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scoring and footprint analysis. The effect of MP treatment on BBB score was apparent the day after SCI whereas the effect of NgR(310)ecto-Fc was not apparent until 2 weeks after SCI. NgR(310)ecto-Fc or MP treatment resulted in increased axonal sprouting and/or regeneration, quantified by counting biotin dextran amine-labeled corticospinal tract axons, and increased the number of axons contacting motor neurons in the ventral horn gray matter caudal to the lesion. Combined treatment with NgR(310)ecto-Fc and MP had a more pronounced effect on recovery of function and axonal growth compared with either treatment alone. The data demonstrate that NgR(310)ecto-Fc and MP act in a temporally and mechanistically distinct manner and suggest that they may have complementary effects.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). In 1990 the results of the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS II) were published, which showed that the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP), which had been previously shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, could improve neurological recovery in spinal-cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI since the drug was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy was obtained in a third NASCIS trial (NASCIS III). In recent years, the use of high-dose MP in acute SCI has become controversial largely on the basis of the risk of serious adverse effects versus what is perceived to be on average a modest neurological benefit. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone was also tested in NASCIS II based upon the demonstration of its beneficial effects in SCI models. Although it did not a significant overall effect, some evidence of efficacy was seen in incomplete (i.e., paretic) patients. The monosialoganglioside GM1 has also been examined in a recently completed clinical trial in which the patients first received high-dose MP treatment. However, GM1 failed to show any evidence of a significant enhancement in the extent of neurological recovery over the level afforded by MP therapy alone. The present paper reviews the past development of MP, naloxone, tirilazad, and GM1 for acute SCI, the ongoing MP-SCI controversy, identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development, and suggests some promising neuroprotective approaches that could either replace or be used in combination with high-dose MP.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Entry criteria were complete SCI between C-5 and T-10 in patients 18 to 65 years of age and no transection demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging. All participants received the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) III methylprednisilone protocol. Cord compression and/or vertebral instability was treated before study entry. After treatment complete SCI (according to the American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] score) remained in all patients with no somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) below the injury level after surgery or for 48 hours. All patients underwent implantation of the OFS within 18 days. Patients underwent evaluation every 2 weeks postimplantation; the OFS was explanted at 15 weeks. Independent neurological status was assessed based on the ASIA score, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and SSEPs at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed Wilcoxon test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). There were no complications at insertion of the OFS; there was one case of wound infection after explantation (5% infection rate). One patient was lost to follow up after 6 months. In all 10 patients the mean VAS pain score was 8 at implantation, 2 at 6 months, and in the nine attending follow up for 1 year it remained 2. At 1 year, the mean improvement in light touch was 25.5 points (ANOVA p < 0.001, Wilcoxon test p = 0.02), the mean improvement in pinprick sensation was 20.4 points (ANOVA p < 0.001, Wilcoxon test p = 0.02), and the mean improvement in motor status was 6.3 points (ANOVA p < 0.01, Wilcoxon test p = 0.02).

The publication of the first National Acute Spinal Cord Injury (NASCIS) trial in 1984 ushered in the era of pharmacological trials of therapies intended to improve neurologic outcome in acute SCI. Subsequent trials of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) and GM-1 have added to the evidence basis that informs the current management practices for acute SCI. The last 50 years have seen a conceptual shift from the pessimism of the past to a cautious optimism that the meager prognosis for neurologic recovery in acute SCI will yield to the progress of medical science. Major advances in the understanding of primary and secondary injury mechanisms have led to the preclinical study of many promising pharmacological therapies, all with the goal of improving neurologic outcome. A few of these drugs have stood the test of animal model experiments and have made it to the forum of human clinical trials. The NASCIS trials of methylprednisolone have been acknowledged widely as the first human studies to claim improved neurologic outcome. Although the results of these trials remain controversial, the MPSS therapy that they reported has been adopted widely by clinicians around the world as the best currently available, even if not a consensus ""standard of care.""

Efficacy was determined by histology, anterograde and retrograde tracing, immunohistochemistry for gliosis and specific nerve fibers, and several behavioral tests. Administration of MP/IL-10 or SC or SC/OEG transplantation significantly increased the total volume of a 9-mm segment of cord encompassing the injury site at 12 weeks. The combination of either SC or SC/OEG transplantation with MP/IL-10 most significantly reduced cavitation. The individual treatments all significantly increased the volume of normal-appearing tissue compared to injury-only controls; however, significant decreases in the volume of normal-appearing tissue were seen when MP/IL-10 and cell grafts were combined compared to MP/IL-10 alone. SC/OEG grafts were effective in promoting serotonergic fiber growth into the graft and led to more reticulospinal fibers caudal to the graft; combination with MP/IL-10 did not further increase fiber number. Only the combination of MP/IL-10 with SC/OEG transplants significantly improved gross locomotor performance (BBB scores) over injury-only controls. MP/IL-10 given prior to SC-only transplants, however, worsened behavioral outcome. Because beneficial effects of MP/IL-10 were not always additive when combined with cell transplantation, we need to understand (1) how tissue protective agents may transform the milieu of the injured spinal cord to the benefit or detriment of later transplanted cells and (2) whether neuroprotectants need to be re-administered at the time of cell grafting or less invasive transplantation techniques employed to reduce damage to tissue spared by an earlier protection strategy.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Methylprednisolone (MP), by reducing edema and protecting the cell membrane against peroxidation, is the only pharmacological agent with a proven clinically beneficial effect on SCI. Melatonin, known as a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have an effect on lipid peroxidation following experimental SCI. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of MP and melatonin on neurological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological recovery. Female albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into five groups of 18 rats each and six rats for the control group. Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of MP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

A total of 4,876 cases of pediatric trauma treated at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles over a 9-year period (1993-2001) were reviewed. During the study period, 91 cases of spinal cord or spinal column injury were identified, and 30 cases involving a spinal cord injury were identified. Cauda equina injuries were excluded. Seven craniocervical, 12 cervical, 5 thoracic, and 6 thoracolumbar cases were identified. There were 6 cases of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. Eight of the 30 patients received methylprednisolone at the time of admission. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 54 (mean = 19) months. Twenty patients presented with complete injuries (ASIA grade A). Of these, 7 died, 7 had no neurologic recovery, and 6 experienced neurologic improvement. Five of these six eventually became ambulatory with functional gains occurring over a 4- to 50-week period. None of these 5 patients was found to have spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. Of the remaining 10 patients (grades B-D), 8 experienced improvements in neurologic function. Cervical dislocation injuries were associated with a low likelihood of neurologic improvement and atlanto-occipital injuries were associated with early death. Recovery of neurologic function following severe traumatic spinal cord injury occurs with a significantly greater incidence in children than adults, and these improvements can occur over a prolonged postinjury period.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The influence of spontaneous and induced axonal sprouting at the injury site on motor function was tested using rats subjected to moderate SC contusion at T9 level, using megadoses of methylprednisolone (MP) and intralesion implantation of cells from sciatic nerve (PNI). Groups using MP and PNI combined, implant vehicle, and injury with no treatment were also included. Amount of sprouting at the injury sites was significantly different depending on treatment. It was abundant in PNI-treated rats, moderate in rats treated with vehicle or nontreated, and limited in rats given MP with or without PNI (chi2, p=0.0084). This sprouting showed an aberrant course and was located in proliferating tissue at the site of injury, characterized by the presence of ependymal cells, macrophages, and myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells. Functional scores and amount of spared white matter were not significantly different among groups. Correlation of the amount of sprouting vs. functional outcome or vs. amount of spared tissue was not significant, while correlation of functional outcome vs. amount of spared tissue was significant (p<0.0001). In conclusion, PNI increase aberrant sprouting at the injury site, while MP limits such sprouting, in either case without impact on motor function outcome. Missing guiding channels for sprouting axons could explain the absence of any functional improvement.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Recent evidence suggests, however, that immune activity--and specifically autoimmune activity--is evoked by the insult, is beneficial if properly regulated and is amenable to boosting. Thus, for example, vaccination with an altered peptide ligand derived from myelin basic protein reduces the progressive degeneration of neurons that escaped the initial insult, thereby promoting recovery after SCI. As the steroid drug methylprednisolone (MP) is currently the only treatment available for patients with SCI, our purpose in the present study was to examine the mutual compatibility of the two treatments within the post-traumatic therapeutic window. We show, using rats of two different strains, that if MP is injected concomitantly with the therapeutic vaccination, the beneficial effect of the vaccination is diminished. However, if MP is given immediately after the insult and the vaccination 48 h later, MP does not detract from the beneficial effect of the vaccination. These results demonstrate that the therapeutic window after SCI can accommodate immediate administration of MP plus a delayed therapeutic vaccination.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). Indeed, the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP) has been shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, and to improve neurological recovery in spinal cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI, since it was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy has been obtained. This article explains the process of the discovery, development, and Food and Drug Administration regulation of new drugs for SCI; reviews the past development of MP and tirilazad for acute SCI; identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development; and suggests some promising therapeutic approaches that could either replace or be added to high-dose MP.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Recent report demonstrated that MP depresses the expression of growth-promoting neurotrophic factors after acute SCI. The present study was designed to investigate whether continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after MP treatment promotes functional recovery in severe SCI. Contusion injury was produced at the T10 vertebral level of the spinal cord in adult rats. The rats received MP intravenously immediately after the injury and BDNF was infused intrathecally using an osmotic mini-pump for six weeks. Immunohistochemical methods were used to detect ED-1, Growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43), neurofilament (NF), and choline acethyl transferase (ChAT) levels. BDNF did not alter the effect of MP on hematogenous inflammatory cellular infiltration. MP treatment with BDNF infusion resulted in greater axonal survival and regeneration compared to MP treatment alone, as indicated by increases in NF and GAP-43 gene expression. Adjunctive BDNF infusion resulted in better locomotor test scores using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) test.

Searches were carried out on several databases and also on the Internet. Specialist SCI and spinal injury related websites were searched, specifically the Spinal Injuries Association, the British Association of Spinal Cord Injury Specialists and the National Spinal Cord Injury Association. Three separate search strategies were devised to find studies relating to the four key areas. Two reviewers independently screened all study citations for inclusion. The lists of all retrieved studies were scanned for additional studies. Quality of studies was assessed and data were extracted by one reviewer then checked by the second. Data from included studies were summarised within each key area. For dichotomous data, relative risks were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Pooled relative risks were calculated as appropriate. For continuous data, mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and, if data were pooled, weighted mean differences were calculated. Searches were carried out to identify economic evaluations, details of these together with a critical appraisal of quality are presented in structured tables. Quality was assessed using a checklist supplemented with additional comments on the adequacy of methodology where appropriate. For spinal fixation versus no fixation, 68 retrospective observational studies were found that suggested some benefits of fixation surgery. Only four studies were found on fixation surgery in SIUs compared with non-SIU hospitals and no significant differences were seen. All 28 studies concerning delayed referral to a SIU were retrospective observational studies. In most, study details were poorly reported and there was doubt over the comparability of groups at baseline and on confounding factors. Times of referral and transfer were not reported separately. Evidence suggested an effect in favour of the SIU group for neurological improvement. No relevant published studies of any design were found regarding how many people with a new SCI are discharged from hospital without ever being transferred to an SIU. Two systematic reviews were found that assessed the effectiveness of steroids. No studies were identified that considered both costs and the impact on patient outcomes of a given intervention. Although there was evidence to suggest some benefits of fixation surgery and also a benefit of immediate referral to SIUs compared with delayed or no referral, owing to the limitations of the data these should be interpreted with caution. Not enough data were found to assess whether surgery is more beneficial when carried out in SIUs and further research is required in this area. Well-designed prospective observational studies with appropriately matched controls are needed. High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy may be effective in promoting some degree of neurological recovery if given within 8 hours of injury. There is a need for more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological therapy for acute SCI. No published studies of any design were found to answer the question of how many people with acute SCI are discharged from hospital without ever being transferred to an SIU. Primary research involving audit of selected hospital records should be commissioned and published. The search strategy did not identify any full economic evaluations. Future research should include full economic evaluations, possibly alongside a large RCT, which fully consider the costs and consequences of implementing interventions.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury was induced in twenty healthy dogs (2.5-7 kg and 2-4 years) by foreign body insertion which compressed about 25% of spinal cord. There was no conscious proprioception, no extensor postural thrust, and ambulatory. Dogs were divided into four groups according to the treatment; corticosteroid (group A), electroacupuncture (group B), corticosteroid and electroacupuncture (group AB), and control (group C). Neurological examination was performed everyday to evaluate the spinal cord dysfunction until motor functions were returned to normal. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were measured for objective and accurate evaluations. The latency in measured potentials was converted into the velocity for the evaluation of spinal cord dysfunctions. Pain perceptions were normal from pre-operation to 5 weeks after operation. Recovery days of conscious proprioception in groups A, B, AB, and C were 21.2+/-8.5 days, 19.8+/-4.3 days, 8.2+/-2.6 days, and 46.6+/-3.7 days, respectively. Recovery days of extensor postural thrust in group A, group B, group AB, and group C were 12.8+/-6.8 days, 13.8+/-4.8 days, 5.4+/-1.8 days, and 38.2+/-4.2 days, respectively. There were no significant differences between group A and group B. However, recovery days of group AB was significantly shorter than that of other groups and that of group C was significantly delayed (p<0.05). Conduction velocities of each group were significantly decreased after induction of spinal cord injury on SEPs (p<0.05) and they showed a tendency to return to normal when motor functions were recovered.

In this study, we have tested the efficacy of minocycline in ameliorating damage following acute SCI in mice. This semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic has been reported to inhibit the expression and activity of several mediators of tissue injury, including inflammatory cytokines, free radicals and matrix metalloproteinases, making it a suitable candidate for study. Mice were subjected to extradural compression of the spinal cord using a modified aneurysm clip, following which they received treatment with either minocycline or vehicle beginning 1 h after injury. Behavioural testing of hindlimb function was initiated 3 days after injury using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, and at 1 week using the inclined plane test. Functional assessments demonstrated that minocycline administration significantly improved both hindlimb function and strength from 3 to 28 days after injury compared with vehicle controls. Furthermore, gross lesion size in the spinal cord was significantly reduced by minocycline, and there was evidence of axonal sparing as determined using fluorogold labelling of the rubrospinal tract and by Bielchowsky silver stain. Finally, a comparison of minocycline against the currently approved treatment for acute SCI in humans, methylprednisolone, demonstrated superior behavioural recovery in the minocycline-treated animals.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

A decade ago, treating SCI seemed frustrating and hopeless because of the tremendous morbidity and mortality, life-shattering impact, and limited therapeutic options associated with the condition. Today, however, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the development of neuroprotective interventions, and progress toward regenerative interventions are increasing hope for functional restoration. This study addresses the present understanding of SCI, including the etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and scientific advances. The discussion of treatment options includes a critical review of high-dose methylprednisolone and GM-1 ganglioside therapy. The concept that limited rebuilding can provide a disproportionate improvement in quality of life is emphasized throughout. New surgical procedures, pharmacologic treatments, and functional neuromuscular stimulation methods have evolved over the last decades that can improve functional outcomes after spinal cord injury, but limiting secondary injury remains the primary goal. Tissue replacement strategies, including the use of embryonic stem cells, become an important tool and can restore function in animal models. Controlled clinical trials are now required to confirm these observations. The ultimate goal is to harness the body's own potential to replace lost central nervous system cells by activation of endogenous progenitor cell repair mechanisms.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Contusion injury to adult rat spinal cord was produced at the T(10) vertebra level followed by immediate intravenous MP or CSF, and was thereafter infused intrathecally with BDNF or CSF for 6 weeks. Axonal remyelination and functional recovery was observed using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and open field locomotion. An increase of 28.4% +/- 2.3% in the expression of proteolipid protein (PLP) gene, an endogenous indicator of axonal remyelination, was demonstrated in group A 24 hours after injury. Ten weeks later, there were significant decreases in hematogenous inflammatory cellular infiltration in groups A and B compared to C (P < 0.05). Concomitantly, a significant amount of axonal remyelination was observed in group A compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). Furthermore, combination therapy using MP and BDNF in group A resulted in stimulation of hindlimb activity as well as improvement in the rate of functional recovery in open field locomotion (P < 0.05). Combined therapy of MP and BDNF can improve functional recovery through mechanisms that include attenuating inflammatory cellular infiltration and enhancing axonal remyelination at the injury site.

Controversy surrounds the pharmacologic and surgical management of patients with spinal cord injuries. Neurologic data were collected retrospectively and classified using American Spinal Injury Association guidelines. This information was recorded at the time of injury, on admission to rehabilitation, on discharge from rehabilitation, and at 1, 2, and final year of follow-up evaluation. Outcome measures included change in motor score, change in sensory score, final motor score, and final sensory score. The SPSS v10.0.7 statistical software package was used for data analysis. Neurologic recovery was not related to the following factors: gender, race, type of fracture, or mechanism of injury. Neurologic recovery also was not related to the following interventions: high-dose methylprednisolone administration, early definitive surgery, early anterior decompression for burst fractures or disc herniations, or decompression of stenotic canals without fracture. Improved neurologic outcomes were, however, noted in younger patients ( = 0.002), and those with either a central cord or Brown-Sequard syndrome ( = 0.019). The most important prognostic variable relating to neurologic recovery in a patient with a spinal cord injury is the completeness of the lesion. When an incomplete cervical spinal cord lesion exists, younger patients and those with either a central cord or Brown-Sequard syndrome have a more favorable prognosis for recovery. In this study, no evidence was found to support high-dose steroid administration, routine early surgical intervention, or surgical decompression in stenotic patients without fracture.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by 5.4 mg/kg/hr intravenous infusion) or saline solution was administered to thirty-six beagles (eighteen in each group) five minutes after cessation of dynamic spinal cord compression and loss of all somatosensory evoked potentials.

Seven dogs treated with methylprednisolone and none treated with saline solution recovered measurable somatosensory evoked potentials during sustained compression. After decompression, three more dogs treated with methylprednisolone and seven dogs treated with saline solution recovered somatosensory evoked potentials. Four dogs treated with methylprednisolone lost their previously measurable somatosensory evoked potentials. In the methylprednisolone group, spinal cord blood flow was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the dogs that had recovered somatosensory evoked potentials than it was in the dogs that had not.

After lesioning the corticospinal tract in adult rats, ECs were transplanted into the lesion, and MP was administered for 24 hr. At 6 weeks after injury, functional recovery was assessed by measuring successful performance of directed forepaw reaching (DFR), expressed as percentages. Axonal regeneration was analyzed by counting the number of corticospinal axons, anterogradely labeled with biotin dextran tetramethylrhodamine, caudal to the lesion. Lesioned control rats, receiving either no treatment or vehicle, had abortive axonal regrowth (1 mm) and poor DFR success (38 and 42%, respectively). Compared with controls, MP-treated rats had significantly more axons 7 mm caudal to the lesion, and DFR performance was significantly improved (57%). Rats that received ECs in combination with MP had significantly more axons than all other lesioned rats up to 13 mm. Successful DFR performance was significantly higher in rats with EC transplants, both without (72%) and with (78%) MP, compared with other lesioned rats. These data confirm previous reports that ECs promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord lesions.

To evaluate the course of neurologic function and to identify predictors of a good neurologic recovery in patients with ACCSCI-U. Little is known regarding the time-course profile of neurologic and functional recovery and the prognostic factors for neurologic recovery in patients with ACCSCI-U. Between 1997 and 1998, 22 new cases of ACCSCI-U were identified (15 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 45.9 years (range, 13-75 years). They were all treated nonsurgically. Neurologic impairment, as evaluated by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor and sensory scores, was assessed on patient arrival at the emergency department and followed prospectively at intervals from admission to the 2-year follow-up. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed acutely (1 hours to 2 days after injury), subacutely (3-21 days after injury), and chronically (3-9 months after injury). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the variables that were associated with neurologic improvement. No patient sustained cervical fractures. The mean sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canals (14.8 mm) was smaller than that of normal subjects in Japan. Of these 22 patients, seven (32%) had radiologic evidence of developmental cervical canal stenosis and two (9%) had evidence of ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. Thirteen (59%) had cervical spondylosis: of these, four (31%) had cervical stenosis. Nonsurgical treatment resulted in nearly full neurologic recovery within approximately 6 weeks after the injury. None of the patients went on to need surgery. Their average ASIA score of motor, light touch sensation, and pin sensation was increased from 82.2, 104.5, and 104.3 at admission to 99.3, 111.2, and 111.0, respectively, at 2 years after injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the best predictor associated with a better neurologic recovery of motor, light touch sensation, and pin sensation was the absence of MRI findings of abnormal signal intensity in the spinal cord, with an odds ratio of 64 (P < 0.006), 13 (P < 0.04),and 15 (P < 0.03), respectively. The results also revealed that percent deficit improvement became significant at 1 week after injury to predict neurologic recovery at 2-year follow-up points. In patients with ACCSCI-U, a favorable neurologic prognosis can be predicted following nonsurgical treatment. Most recovery occurred by 6 weeks, and patients with severe initial neurologic damage and old age had poorer recovery. Touch and pin sensation recovered at the same rate, whereas motor recovered more quickly.

All published or unpublished randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. Data have been abstracted from original trial reports. For the NASCIS, Japanese and French trials, additional data (e.g. SDs) have been obtained from the original authors. There are few trials in this area of medical care. Only one steroid has been extensively studied, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, which has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg administered over 15 minutes with a maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial was replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data has been obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This analysis indicates significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy when administration commences within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (for a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status is observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries and a modified regimen found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. High dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacological therapy shown to have efficacy in a Phase Three randomized trial when it can be administered within eight hours of injury. A recent trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. There is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacological therapy for acute spinal cord injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

This has led to questions concerning the clinical importance of the increase in neurological recovery observed following administration of methylprednisolone (MP) within 8 hours of acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The safety of the therapy has also been questioned. Both neurological and functional recovery were assessed in NASCIS III, a trial that followed an almost identical protocol to NASCIS II. In the current analysis locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) nonparametric regression is used to model the extent of recovery in the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) that is predicted by improvement in the NASCIS/American Spinal Cord Injury Association motor scores that were documented in NASCIS III 1 year after SCI, and the models are applied to the extent of motor recovery demonstrated in NASCIS II. The models predict improvement in FIM that would be expected from the motor function recovery observed in NASCIS II. Estimates are provided overall and for patients with complete and incomplete neurological loss at time of injury. The authors review recent evidence obtained from randomized studies documenting adverse effects that may result from high-dose MP therapy. The relationship between motor function and FIM is strongly nonlinear and dependent on initial level of injury and degree of injury severity. In the best statistical model, the expanded motor score could be used to explain 77.2% of the variability in the FIM. Based on the mean MP-related 3.6-unit improvement in the motor score for patients with complete injuries and 7.3 for those with incomplete injuries owed to MP in NASCIS II, 18.6% of patients would improve six or more FIM points and 9% nine or more points, respectively. In those with complete neurological injury, the mean motor improvement of 3.6 predicted that 63.9% of the patients would improve three or more FIM points and 12.1% six or more points to a maximum of eight points. Of those with incomplete neurological injury, a 7.3 mean improvement in motor function predicted that 27.4% would gain six or more FIM points and that 21% would gain nine or more points to a maximum of 15 points. Analysis of the current best evidence from SCI and other randomized surgical trials in which high-dose MP has been administered provides no grounds for concern about commonly studied adverse effects. The extent of MP therapy-related motor function recovery observed in NASCIS II predicted clinically important recovery in the FIM. Reasons to be cautious with regard to this prediction include the lack of robustness in statistical modeling, some loss of validity in the FIM, and considerable heterogeneity in the SCI population. Whatever functional activity is ascribed to high-dose MP therapy, it is does not appear to be associated with risk of adverse outcomes.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The mechanisms for its beneficial actions are not entirely clear, but experimental evidence suggests MPSS affords some degree of neuroprotection. As many studies with rat models of SCI have been unable to demonstrate improved behavioral outcome or tissue sparing after MPSS treatment, we chose to stereologically assess whether it alters lesion volume and tissue sparing over time, as well as long-term behavioral recovery. Adult rats subjected to contusion SCI with the NYU impactor were administered either MPSS or saline for 24 hr beginning 5 min post injury. Over time the lesion dimensions were extremely dynamic, such that by 6 weeks post injury the volumes were reduced to a third of those seen after the first week. MPSS marginally reduced lesion volumes across time vs. controls, but the amount of spared gray and white matter remained unaltered between the two groups. Behavioral results further showed that MPSS failed to improve recovery of hind-limb function. These findings add to the emerging scrutiny of MPSS as the standard therapy for acute SCI, as well as indicate the existence of a therapeutic window for tissue sparing restricted to the first several days after this type of SCI in rats. Equally important, our results caution the use of lesion volume dimensions or percent tissue sparing at the epicenter as indicators of therapeutic efficacy because neither reflects the actual amount of tissue sparing.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Pharmacologic interventions, in particular intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, have shown modest improvements in clinical trials and are still undergoing evaluation. More recent interest has focused on the role of surgical reduction and decompression, particularly ""early"" surgery. A review of the current evidence available in the literature suggests that there is no standard of care regarding the role and timing of surgical decompression. There are insufficient data to support overall treatment standards or guidelines for this topic. There are, however, Class II data indicating that early surgery (<24 hours) may be done safely after acute SCI. Furthermore, there are Class III data to suggest a role for urgent decompression in the setting of 1) bilateral facet dislocation and 2) incomplete spinal cord injury with a neurologically deteriorating patient. Whereas there is biologic evidence from experimental studies in animals that early decompression may improve neurologic recovery after SCI, the relevant time frame in humans remains unclear. To date, the role of decompression in patients with SCI is only supported by Class III and limited Class II evidence and accordingly can be considered only a practice option. Accordingly, there is a strong rationale to undertake prospective, controlled trials to evaluate the role and timing of decompression in acute SCI.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Of the 760 patients, 43 died within 365 days. The rate was higher for complete injuries (7.1% vs. 3.2%, P = 0.017). Marked recovery at 26 weeks was more frequent in those with better baseline American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) scores, but was not different for methylprednisolone within versus after 3 hours. Light touch scores improved at each visit, more so in those with higher scores at baseline. Bladder control similarly improved. Motor and sensory scores exhibited departures from assumptions underlying normal-theory statistical techniques: t test and analysis of variance. Furthermore, they were mixtures of differing distributions from different study strata, so that overall conclusions depend on the mixture of patients seen. The prognosis of these patients with spinal cord injury seen at 28 centers in North America during the mid-1990s appears better than was often assumed earlier. The general patterns are similar across different measurement scales, although there are intriguing differences. The patterns in different strata are different in specifics, and complete injuries do less well. Pooling data from different strata may result in probability distributions that depart from normal-theory assumptions and give misleading results depending on recruitment patterns.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Three trials by the NASCIS group were of high methodologic quality, and a Japanese and French trial of moderate to low, methodologic quality. Meta-analysis of the final result of three trials comparing 24-hour high-dose MPSS with placebo or no therapy indicates an average unilateral 4.1 motor function score improvement (95% confidence interval 0.6-7.6, P = 0.02) in patients treated with MPSS. This neurologic recovery is likely to be correlated with improved functional recovery in some patients. The safety of this regimen of MPSS is evident from the spinal cord injury trials and a systematic review of 51 surgical trials of high-dose MPSS.

The authors decided to collate the views of the delegates at the CSRS regarding the use of steroids for acute traumatic spinal cord injury. A questionnaire was created that took into account the positive reported findings as well as the criticisms of the NASCIS studies. Delegates who attended the European CSRS meeting completed this questionnaire. Seventy-five percent of the delegates answered that they used or recommended methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Nevertheless, the delegates had an average of 1.5 reservations about administering methylprednisolone. The most common reservation was that they did not think the improvement conferred to the patients by administering methylprednisolone had been clinically or functionally proven. There were reservations about the validity of the statistical analysis used in the NASCIS studies and by the omission of a placebo group in NASCIS III. The majority of the delegates thought it was not medicolegally negligent to withhold the administration of methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The use of methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury is still controversial. It would appear from a recent prospective audit at the authors' spinal injuries unit that a large percentage of patients in the United Kingdom are not receiving methylprednisolone.

However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment.

The potential for neurological recovery depends on optimal preservation of the ascending and descending white matter axons and their normal myelination. Pharmacologic strategies focus on the control of secondary injury processes, primarily lipid peroxidation (LP), and the salvage of as much white matter as possible. The first effective neuroprotective agent was methylprednisolone (MP), a glucocorticosteroid that in high doses improves neurological recovery in animals and humans following acute SCI. Tirilazad is a more targeted non-glucocorticoid LP inhibitor that has been shown to be neuroprotective and has fewer side effects than MP. Future SCI therapy is likely to encompass various neuroprotective agents, including inhibitors of LP, inhibitors of the nitric oxide-derived reactive oxygen species peroxynitrite, inhibitors of calpain (which is responsible for degrading the spinal cord cytoskeleton), and inhibitors of post-traumatic apoptosis of neurons and myelin-forming oligodendroglia. In addition, neuroprotective strategies will eventually be followed by neurorestorative agents that stimulate the plasticity of surviving neural pathways, and will be used in conjunction with other neurorestorative therapies like cell transplantation and gene therapy techniques.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Improvements in neurocritical care and the implementation of evidence-based treatment guidelines for severe head injury victims may also, in part, be responsible for improved survival rates and reduced disability rates. Unfortunately, numerous clinical trials of putative neuroprotective agents conducted in North America and elsewhere during the 1990s have failed to demonstrate efficacy in head-injured patients.

Hindlimb motor function was assessed as the BBB open field locomotor scores. The BBB scores of three groups treated with either PC-SOD (40,000 units/kg), MP (30 mg/kg), or a combination of PC-SOD and MP (PC-SOD+MP) increased with time until 3 days after SCI, and were significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). Thereafter, the score of the PC-SOD group increased, whereas that of the MP group showed a temporary decrease from day 3 to 5 and then it gradually recovered. The scores in all groups reached a plateau about 18 days after SCI. The PC-SOD+MP group did not show a synergism but a tendency similar to that of the MP group. PC-SOD and MP had down-regulatory effects on mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and inducible-nitric oxide synthetase (i-NOS) after spinal cord compression at 3, 6, and 24 h, respectively, as judged by a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and on the lipid peroxide (LPO) level 1 h after injury as determined by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The suppression of pro-inflammatory genes expression, especially IL-1beta were greater in the MP group than in the PC-SOD group, while suppression of LPO level was similar in these two groups. PC-SOD+MP treatment augmented the suppression of all three pro-inflammatory genes expression and the decrease of the LPO level. The level of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA increased from 6 h after SCI and reached a maximum after 48 h. NT-3 mRNA level was enhanced by PC-SOD treatment, but not by MP treatment. Thus, the effect of MP in suppressing these pro-inflammatory genes expression was more than that of PC-SOD. The difference in motor function in the early and later stage may be partially due to differences in expression of IL-1beta and NT-3 after either treatment, through an IL-1beta-dependent or NT-3-mediated repair response.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Spinal cord contusion was induced in rats by applying an aneurysm clip extradurally to the spinal cord at T-3 for 1 minute. After injury three groups of rats were treated with intravenously administered saline (control), intraperitoneally administered fasudil (10 mg/kg), or intravenously administered methylprednisolone (four 30 mg/kg injections). Neurological recovery was evaluated periodically over 1 month by using a modified combined behavioral scale and histopathological examination. Leukocyte infiltration near the injury site was evaluated by measuring myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity at 24 hours. Spinal cord blood flow was measured at intervals up to 3 hours after injury by using laser Doppler flowmetry. In rats in the fasudil-treated group significant improvement in modified combined behavioral score was demonstrated at each time point, whereas in the methylprednisolone-treated rats no beneficial effects were shown. In the fasudil-treated group, reduction of traumatic spinal cord damage was evident histologically in the caudal portion of the injured areas, and tissue MPO activity in tissue samples was reduced. Spinal cord blood flow was not significantly different between fasudil-treated and control group rats. Fasudil hydrochloride showed promise of effectiveness in promoting neurological recovery after traumatic SCI.

NASCIS II was initially reported by National Institutes of Health announcements, National Institutes of Health facsimiles to emergency room physicians, and the news media. The subsequent report in the New England Journal of Medicine implied that there was a positive result in the primary efficacy analysis for the entire 487 patient sample. However, this analysis was in fact negative, and the positive result was found only in a secondary analysis of the subgroup of patients who received treatment within 8 hours. In addition, that subgroup apparently had only 62 patients taking methylprednisolone and 67 receiving placebo. The NASCIS II and III reports embody specific choices of statistical methods that have strongly shaped the reporting of results but have not been adequately challenged or or even explained. These studies show statistical artifacts that call their results into question. In NASCIS II, the placebo group treated before 8 hours did poorly, not only when compared with the methylprednisolone group treated before 8 hours but even when compared with the placebo group treated after 8 hours. Thus, the positive result may have been caused by a weakness in the control group rather than any strength of methylprednisolone. In NASCIS III, a randomization imbalance occurred that allocated a disproportionate number of patients with no motor deficit (and therefore no chance for recovery) to the lower dose control group. When this imbalance is controlled for, much of the superiority of the higher dose group seems to disappear. The NASCIS group's decision to admit persons with minor SCIs with minimal or no motor deficit not only enables statistical artifacts it complicates the interpretation of results from the population actually sampled. Perhaps one half of the NASCIS III sample may have had at most a minor deficit. Thus, we do not know whether the results of these studies reflect the severely injured population to which they have been applied. The numbers, tables, and figures in the published reports are scant and are inconsistently defined, making it impossible even for professional statisticians to duplicate the analyses, to guess the effect of changes in assumptions, or to supply the missing parts of the picture. Nonetheless, even 9 years after NASCIS II, the primary data have not been made public. The reporting of the NASCIS studies has fallen far short of the guidelines of the ICH/FDA and of the Evidence-based Medicine Group. Despite the lucrative ""off label"" markets for methylprednisolone in SCI, no Food and Drug Association indication has been obtained. There has been no public process of validation. These shortcomings have denied physicians the chance to use confidently a drug that many were enthusiastic about and has left them in an intolerably ambiguous position in their therapeutic choices, in their legal exposure, and in their ability to perform further research to help their patients.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Only one therapy has been extensively studied, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, which has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post injury if administered within 8 hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg administered over 15 minutes with a maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial was replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data has been obtained from the latter study to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This analysis indicates significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy. A more recent trial indicates that if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (for a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status is observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between 3 to 8 hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries and a modified regimen found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. High dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacological therapy shown to have efficacy in a Phase Three randomized trial when it can be administered within 8 hours of injury.

The melanocortin melanotropin is known to improve axonal regeneration following sciatic nerve injury, and to stimulate corticospinal outgrowth after partial spinal cord transection. Recently, we showed that intrathecally administered alphaMSH had beneficial effects on functional recovery after experimental SCI. Since both drugs have shown their value in intervention studies after (experimental) spinal cord injury (ESCI), we decided to study the effects of combined treatment. Our results again showed that alphaMSH enhances functional recovery after ESCI in the rat and that MP, although not affecting functional recovery adversely by itself, abolished the effects observed with alphaMSH when combined.

The current standard of care is to administer MP as a bolus of 30 mg/kg followed by a 23-h infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h to spinal cord injured patients. To better understand the role of MP in neuroprotection, we have studied how MP administration affects macrophage accumulation, tissue loss, and axonal dieback at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after a complete transection of the eighth thoracic spinal cord in the adult rat. A 30 mg/kg dose of MP was administered intravenously at 5 min, and 2 and 4 h after injury. The number of ED1 (antibody against microglia/macrophages) -positive cells was quantified in a 500-micrometer-wide strip of tissue directly adjacent and parallel to the transection. At all time points, MP treatment led to a significant decrease in the number of ED1-positive cells in both rostral and caudal stumps. Over the 2-month post-transection period, the average MP-induced reduction in the number of ED1-positive cells was 82% in the rostral cord stump and 66% in the caudal stump. Using a computerized image analysis system, it was observed that MP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tissue loss in both cord stumps at 2, 4 and 8 week post-injury. Over the 2-month post-lesion period, the average MP-induced reduction in tissue loss in the caudal cord stump was higher than that in the rostral stump; 48 versus 37%, respectively. Immunostaining for neurofilaments and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) revealed the presence of numerous axons near and in the lesion site. Anterograde neuronal tracing with biotinylated dextran amine showed that, in MP-treated animals, dieback of vestibulospinal fibres, but not of corticospinal fibres, was significantly diminished at all time points studied. In addition, with MP administration, 1 and 2 weeks after injury, an increase in the number of vestibulospinal fibres was found at 1 and 2 mm from the transection, suggesting transient regenerative sprouting of these fibres. The results demonstrate that treatment with MP shortly after spinal cord transection in the adult rat led to a long-term reduction of ED1-positive cells and spinal tissue loss, reduced dieback of vestibulospinal fibres, and a transient sprouting of vestibulospinal fibres near the lesion at 1 and 2 weeks post-lesion. The possible relationships between the inflammatory changes, spinal tissue sparing, and axonal survival and sprouting are complex and need to be further explored.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Whereas the primary injury is fated by the circumstances of the trauma, the outcome of the secondary injury may be amenable to therapeutic modulation. This article reviews the pathogenetic determinants of these two phases of injury and summarizes the pharmacological manipulations that may restore neurological function after SCI. Experimental models of SCI and their inherent limitations in simulating human SCI are surveyed. The pathogenesis of primary and secondary injury, as well as the theoretical bases of neurological recovery, are examined in detail. The effects of glucocorticoids, lazeroids, gangliosides, opiate antagonists, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor antagonists, antioxidants, free radical scavengers, and other pharmacological agents in both animal models and human trials are summarized. Practical limitations to inducing neural regeneration are also addressed. The molecular events that mediate the pathogenesis of SCI are logical targets for pharmacological manipulation and include glutamate accumulation, aberrant calcium fluxes, free radical formation, lipid peroxidation, and generation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Enhancement of neural regeneration and plasticity comprise other possible strategies. Pharmacological agents must be given within a narrow window of opportunity to be effective. Although many therapeutic agents show potential promise in animal models, only methylprednisolone has been shown in large, randomized, double-blinded human studies to enhance the functional recovery of neural elements after acute SCI. Future therapy is likely to involve various combinations of these agents.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The long-term effect of this compound in chronic model of SCI is not known. In this study, after a compression injury of 50 grams in rats, a randomized treatment was initiated 3 weeks after the initial injury which was followed by daily administration of 4-AP at 2 mg/kg (n = 8), 4 mg/kg (n = 8), and 6 mg/kg (n = 8) for 4 weeks. A group of methylprednisolone (MP)-treated (30 mg/kg, n = 8) and non-treated animals (n = 8) were included for comparison. The functional motor outcome was measured in each animal at regular time points up to 4 weeks post-treatment. All animals receiving 6 mg/kg developed generalized seizure and were excluded from the study. In the other animal groups, analysis of the behavioral outcome and neuro-pathological changes were essentially similar and did not show any significant effect of treatment. Our data indicate that daily administration of 4-AP, over 4 weeks of treatment period, lacks any significant effect on axonal function in chronically injured rats. This could be due to (a) lack of significant numbers of demyelinated axons which could improve the functional outcome and (b) a treatment regimen that was not adequate to contribute to a better functional outcome. One time bolus-administration of MP at 30 mg/kg also did not ensure a better functional outcome.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Neurotrophins play important roles in normal development of central and peripheral nervous system. It is reported that traumatic insults to the brain alter the expression of these neurotrophins. These responses are considered to trigger a cascade of cellular protection and repair. First, we investigated the temporal and spatial expression patterns of neurotrophin and IL-1 beta mRNAs in the area of spinal cord lesion. Second, we examined if methylprednisolone (MP) affects the expression of these genes in SCI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 gms) were laminectomized at T10. Spinal cord was crushed by clipping (holding force 60 gms, 1 sec). Rats were killed at 1, 6, 12, 24 h, and 72 h after the injury and the spinal cord was rapidly removed and frozen sections were cut. Second, the other group of rats were treated with MP (165 mg/kg) just after SCI and sacrificed at 6 h. The levels of neurotrophins and IL-1 beta mRNAs were evaluated by in situ hybridization histochemistry. IL-1 beta mRNA level was elevated at 1 h and 6 h and attenuated at 12 h. The increased level of BDNF and NT3 mRNAs were first observed at 6 h and the labeling was enhanced at 24 h and 72 h. In MP treated group, the levels of IL-1 beta, BDNF and NT3 mRNAs were attenuated compared with those of MP-untreated SCI group. Steroid hormone therapy diminishes the post-traumatic inflammatory cascades which produce edema and swelling and worsen neuronal injury. However, glucocorticoid may hinder the endogenous repair mechanism. Our data show that MP depress the production of BDNF and NT3 following SCI, which might be disadvantageous to the survival of spinal neurons.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

A total of 499 patients with acute spinal cord injury diagnosed in National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) centers within 8 hours of injury.

Recently agreed upon international standards establish a uniform neurologic classification to measure clinical outcomes. They are currently in use in three multicenter studies in more than 40 SCI centers in the United States. The Model System SCI centers report the use of these measures, such as impairment grades and neurologic levels, in almost 15,000 cases over the past 20 years and, more recently, motor scores in 3,500 patients. The NASCIS II multicenter trial on methylprednisolone used motor and sensory scores as endpoints in close to 500 patients, but have incorporated the international standards, which include a disability measure, in NASCIS III. The study of ganglioside effectiveness also is using these measures in many patients. In more focused studies, neurologic assessment soon after injury can predict walking in motor complete injuries based on pin prick sensation, and in motor incomplete injuries based on impairment grade and age. Eventual upper extremity function can be estimated based on the motor examination within 72 hours of injury. Both the motor score and motor level are more reliable in predicting upper extremity function than the single sensory level. This presumably reflects the greater importance of motor recovery on functional outcome. The proximal muscles of the lower extremities caudal to the lesion site recover before distal muscles, and this may be mediated by axons descending in the ventral tracts, which control primarily proximal rather than distal muscles. These axons may be preferentially spared and/or have greater capacity to compensate than those present in the lateral columns. In conclusion, standard neurologic assessment in SCI is extremely valuable in monitoring recovery in order to prognosticate functional outcome, evaluate effectiveness of drug interventions, and provide valuable clues to possible underlying mechanisms of recovery. The elucidation of these mechanisms will aid in the refinement of current treatments and development of new strategies to enhance neurologic recovery and functional outcome.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

In conclusion, we suggest that it seems unlikely that any single intervention strategy will be sufficient to ensure regeneration of damaged pathways and recovery of function after SCI. Clearly, work from a number of laboratories indicates that the dogma that mature CNS neurons are inherently incapable of regeneration of axons after injury is no longer tenable. The issue, rather, is to identify and reverse the conditions that limit regeneration after SCI. After SCI, a hierarchy of ""intervention-strategies"" may be required to restore suprasegmental control leading to recovery of function. The hierarchy may be both temporal and absolute. For example, early interventions (such as the administration of methylprednisolone within hours of the injury) may be required to interrupt the secondary injury cascade and restrict the extent of damage after SCI. At the injury site itself, interventions to minimize the secondary injury effects may be followed by interventions to alter the environment at the site of injury to provide a terrain conducive to axonal elongation. For example, one might envision strategies to downregulate the expression of molecules that limit growth and upregulate the expression of those that support growth. Early after the injury, axotomized neurons may require neurotrophic support either for their survival or to initiate and maintain a cell body response supporting axonal elongation. There may be an absolute hierarchy as well. Particular populations of neurons may have very specific requirements for regenerative growth. For example, the conditions that enhance the regenerative growth of descending motor pathways may differ from those required by ascending sensory systems. One may also want to design strategies to restrict the plasticity of some pathways (e.g., nociceptive) and enhance the growth in other pathways. The demands on the CNS for anatomic reorganization after SCI may be far less formidable than one might at first imagine. If one assumes that recovery of function will require regenerative growth of large numbers of axons over long distances in a point-to-point topographically specific fashion, the idea of recovery of function becomes daunting. On the other hand, it has been shown in many studies and in many areas of the CNS that as little as 10% of a particular pathway can often subserve substantial function. Furthermore, regrowth over relatively short distances can have major functional consequences. For example, relatively modest changes in the level of SCI can have relatively profound effects on the functional consequences of injury. This is particularly true in cervical SCI: an individual with a C5/6 SCI is dramatically more impaired than one with C7/8 injury. One might envision relatively short distance growth across the injury site to re-establish suprasegmental control. Coupled with strategies to enhance the anatomic and functional reorganization of spinal cord circuitry caudal to the level of the injury, even modest long distance growth may have sufficient functional impact. One might imagine the ability to learn to ""use"" even modest quantities of novel inputs in functionally useful, appropriate ways.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

In two independent randomized blinded experiments, treatment with either alpha MSH (75 micrograms/kg of body weight administered subcutaneously every 48 h for 3 weeks after trauma) or single high-dose (30 mg/kg, 30 min after injury) methylprednisolone was compared with saline treatment in rats subjected to a moderately severe 20-gcm weight drop injury. Spinal cord function was monitored using behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological parameters. In both experiments, alpha MSH significantly improved recovery, as illustrated by Tarlov scores, thoracolumbar height, and amplitude of rubrospinal motor evoked potentials. The magnitude of the alpha MSH effect on motor performance was comparable with the one observed after treatment with methylprednisolone. The reproducible neurological and electrophysiological improvement in spinal cord function of animals treated with alpha MSH suggests a new lead in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The rationale for this regimen has been based upon the need for high doses (i.e., 30 mg/kg initial IV dose) to inhibit posttraumatic lipid peroxidation (LP) in the injured spinal segment. However, injury also triggers the immediate calcium-mediated activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the release of arachidonic acid, and the enzymatic formation of potentially deleterious prostaglandins (PGE2 alpha, PGE2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and leukotrienes (LTs). Thus, in view of the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated inhibition of PLA2 that underlies much of MP's antiinflammatory actions, an additional neuroprotective mechanism may relate to an inhibition of eicosanoid formation. Using the cat spinal cord compression model (180g x 5 min at L3; Na pentobarbitol anesthesia), we examined whether 30 min postinjury dosing with MP (30 mg/kg IV) could attenuate spinal tissue eicosanoid levels measured by enzyme immunoassay at 1 h (Experiment 1). Pial blood flow was measured over the dorsal columns at the injury site using laser doppler flowmetry to monitor posttraumatic hyperperfusion as an index of the microvascular pathophysiology of acute SCI. In vehicle treated animals at 1 h postinjury, there was a significant increase in the tissue levels of PGF2 alpha (+290%), PGE2 (+260%), TXB2 (stable analog of TXA2, +126%), and LTB4 (+73%) in comparison to sham, uninjured animals. However, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (stable analog of prostacyclin or PGI2) and LTC4 did not increase. Methylprednisolone did not reduce the increase in eicosanoid production. In the case of LTB4 and LTC4, MP actually increased the levels further. In addition, we examined the effects of a double dose MP regimen (30 mg/kg IV at 30 min plus 15 mg/kg IV at 2.5 h postinjury) on spinal cord eicosanoid levels at 4 h postinjury (Experiment 2). At 4 h postinjury, significant increases in PGF2 alpha, PGE2, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were observed, and with the exception of PGE2, no MP attenuation of the increased eicosanoids was seen. These results fail to provide evidence that postinjury administration of high dose MP exerts a significant anti-PLA2 action. On the other hand, MP effectively inhibited secondary spinal cord pial hyperperfusion, which is believed to be largely mediated by free radical-lipid peroxidative mechanisms. Thus, it seems likely that the protective action of MP on the acute microvascular pathophysiology of SCI is mediated by its well-documented effects on posttraumatic LP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Glucocorticosteroids were first used in patients with acute spinal cord injury in the 1960s. An initial randomized clinical trial (NASCIS I) did not demonstrate a difference in outcome between the low- and high-dose steroid therapy. A subsequent study (NASCIS II) demonstrated that a treatment could enhance neurologic recovery. The authors critically review the preclinical studies of glucocorticosteroids, NASCIS I and NASCIS II: The majority of the critique focuses on NASCIS II and independent analysis of the data generated by that trial. NASCIS II suggests clinical benefit from high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. The true benefit of steroid therapy is unclear because of the difference in outcome of the two placebo groups who entered the protocol before and after 8 hours. The initial promising results may be negated by the better recovery of the delayed treatment and/or untreated group of patients in the greater than 8-hour placebo group. However, until the raw patient data from NASCIS II is made available for independent review, the actual benefit of intensive steroid therapy will remain elusive. Even with the controversies and unresolved issues, we advocate initiation of intensive glucocorticosteroid therapy as soon as possible after acute spinal cord injury, and not beyond the first 8 hours.

Because GM1 may have additive or synergistic effects when used with MP, the authors compared MP, GM1, and MP+GM1 treatments in a graded rat spinal cord contusion model. Spinal cord injury was caused by dropping a rod weighing 10 gm from a height of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 cm onto the rat spinal cord at T-10, which had been exposed via laminectomy. The lesion volumes were quantified from spinal cord Na and K shifts at 24 hours after injury and the results were verified histologically in separate experiments. A single dose of MP (30 mg/kg), given 5 minutes after injury, reduced 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes by 56% (p = 0.0052), 28% (p = 0.0065), and 13% (p > 0.05) in the three injury-severity groups, respectively, compared to similarly injured control groups treated with vehicle only. Methylprednisolone also prevented injury-induced hyponatremia and increased body weight loss in the spine-injured rats. When used alone, GM1 (10 to 30 mg/kg) had little or no effect on any measured variable compared to vehicle controls; when given concomitantly with MP, GM1 blocked the neuroprotective effects of MP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, GM1 partially prevented MP-induced reductions in lesion volumes, while 10 to 30 mg/kg of GM1 completely blocked these effects of MP. The effects of MP on injury-induced hyponatremia and body weight loss were also blocked by GM1. Thus, GM1 antagonized both central and peripheral effects of MP in spine-injured rats. Until this interaction is clarified, the authors recommend that MP and GM1 not be used concomitantly to treat acute human spinal cord injury. Because GM1 modulates protein kinase activity, protein kinases inhibit lipocortins, and lipocortins mediate anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, it is proposed that the neuroprotective effects of MP are partially due to anti-inflammatory effects and that GM1 antagonizes the effects of MP by inhibiting lipocortin. Possible beneficial effects of GM1 reported in central nervous system injury may be related to the effects on neural recovery rather than acute injury processes.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

This analysis demonstrates that the greatest proportion of all neurological recovery and of recovery due to treatment with very high doses of methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury occurs below the lesion. Methylprednisolone treatment administered early following injury has been found to improve recovery below the lesion in patients initially diagnosed as having complete or incomplete injuries; it also leads to greater (but still relatively small) improvement in the injury level. The analysis indicates that delayed treatment with methylprednisolone is associated with decreased neurological recovery. Naloxone administration also improved neurological function below the lesion in patients with incomplete injuries; these results support further experimental work with this drug. This observation of differential neurological response within a narrow treatment window has important implications for both experimental studies and clinical management.

Medical treatment to aid damaged neurons to recover function has been very limited; therapeutic efforts have focused primarily on initial stabilization of fractures, hemodynamic resuscitation, and then aggressive rehabilitation to enhance the full development of any remaining neuronal activity. Pharmacological treatment to improve restoration of neurological function may be possible, however, as indicated by many animal studies and a few clinical studies with a number of agents. A recent clinical trial of GM-1 ganglioside conducted in patients with spinal cord injuries showed that GM-1 ganglioside enhanced the recovery of neurological function 1 year after major spinal cord injury. In addition to GM-1 ganglioside treatment, these patients received aggressive medical and surgical treatment, as well as methylprednisolone. Neurological recovery was assessed with the Frankel scale and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scale. The findings show enhanced motor recovery compared with placebo in the lower extremities, but not in the upper extremities, over time. This corresponds to improved function of axons passing through the site of injury. Analysis of individual motor groups showed that neurological recovery in the GM-1 ganglioside-treated patients increased in initially paralyzed muscles, enabling them to regain useful motor function; paretic muscles were not found to be strengthened.

Although much work remains, four criteria that are logically required to establish the pathophysiological importance of oxygen radical reactions have been met, at least in part. First of all, oxygen radical generation and lipid peroxidation appear to be early biochemical events subsequent to CNS trauma. Second, a growing body of direct or circumstantial evidence suggests that oxygen radical formation and lipid peroxidation are linked to pathophysiological processes such as hypoperfusion, edema, axonal conduction failure, failure of energy metabolism, and anterograde (wallerian) degeneration. Third, there is a striking similarity between the pathology of blunt mechanical injury to CNS tissue and that produced by chemical induction of peroxidative injury. Fourth, and most convincing, is the repeated observation that compounds that inhibit lipid peroxidation or scavenge oxygen radicals can block posttraumatic pathophysiology and promote functional recovery and survival in experimental studies. Nevertheless, the significance of oxygen radicals and lipid peroxidation ultimately depends on whether it can be demonstrated that early application of effective antifree radical or antiperoxidative agents can promote survival and neurological recovery after CNS injury and stroke in humans. The results of the NASCIS II clinical trial, which have shown that an antioxidant dosing regimen with methylprednisolone begun within 8 hr after spinal cord injury can significantly enhance chronic neurological recovery, strongly supports the significance of lipid peroxidation as a posttraumatic degenerative mechanism. However, ongoing Phase III trials with the more selective and effective antioxidant U74006F (tirilazad mesylate) will give a more clear-cut answer as to the therapeutic importance of inhibition of posttraumatic free radical reactions in the injured CNS.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

The drug significantly increased recovery even in severely injured patients who were admitted with no motor or sensory function below the lesion, contradicting a long-held dogma that such patients would not recover. Some researchers, however, have questioned the stratification of the patient population, the use of summed neurologic change scores, and the absence of functional assessments. The stratification by injury severity and treatment time was planned a priori and based on objective criteria. Detailed analyses revealed no differences between groups attributable to stratification or randomization. While multivariate analyses of the summed neurologic scores were used, the conclusions were corroborated by other analytical approaches that did not rely on summed scores. For example, treatment with methylprednisolone more than doubled the probability that patients would convert from quadriplegia or paraplegia to quadriparesis or paraparesis, analgesia to hypalgesia, and anesthesia to hypesthesia. The treatment also significantly improved neurologic scores in lumbosacral segments, indicating that beneficial effects were not limited to segments close to the lesion site. The treatment did not significantly affect mortality or morbidity. The study strongly suggests that methylprednisolone has significant beneficial effects in human spinal cord injury, that these effects occur only when the drug is given within 8 hr, and that it helps even in patients with severe spinal cord injuries.

The recent National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) showed that very high dose methylprednisolone given within 8 hr after injury improves neurologic recovery. The mechanism is believed to be inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Many other drugs have been claimed to be beneficial in animal studies, including other lipid peroxidation inhibitors, free radical scavengers, opiate receptor blockers, NMDA receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, and protease inhibitors. In chronic spinal cord injury, much progress also has been made. Myelin was found to possess factors that inhibit axonal regeneration. Blocking these factors enhances spinal cord regeneration. Monosialic gangliosides (GM1) were recently found to improve neurologic recovery in spinal-cord-injured patients. Given as late as 48-72 hr after injury, the mechanism of action is not well understood. However, the GM1 results give hope that recovery mechanisms can be manipulated pharmacologically. Nonregenerative therapy for chronic spinal cord injury is also being developed. Several drugs, including 4-aminopyridine and baclofen, respectively blockers of potassium channels and GABA-B receptors, improve conduction in demyelinated axons. These drugs may be useful for identifying patients who might benefit from remyelination therapy. Finally, NASCIS has complicated acute spinal cord injury studies. To bring a drug to clinical trial, an investigator must now determine the optimal treatment dose, timing, and duration over a range of injury severities, in comparison and combination with methylprednisolone.

As extracellular potassium recovers, evoked potentials often return but are lost again when white matter blood flow fall. The delayed decline of evoked potentials and blood flow suggest secondary injury processes that may respond to pharmacological therapy. High dose methylprednisolone (15-30 mg/kg) dramatically improved blood flow, extracellular ionic shifts, blood flow, and evoked potentials in cat spinal cords. Methylprednisolone also decreased tissue ionic shifts and improved locomotory recovery. In concomitant experiments, we showed that naloxone also prevented posttraumatic declines in blood flow and improved locomotory recovery. Examination of the spinal cords at 6-12 weeks after injury, revealed that many recovered animals had only 10% of spinal cord axons remaining.

These include the synthetic glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP), and the new 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, U74006F. Treatment of spinal cord-injured cats with high doses of MP promoted or spared locomotor function and preserved spinal cord tissue. Extending these findings in cats to humans, it was recently demonstrated that high doses of MP administered within 8 h of injury significantly improved neurologic recovery in human spinal cord-injured patients. The compound U74006F is one of a series of 21-aminosteroids that, unlike MP, lack glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid or other hormonal activity yet are potent inhibitors of lipid perioxidation. Over a 100-fold range of doses, U74006F promoted recovery of locomotor function in spinal cord-injured cats. The lowest effective dose for U74006F was 100 times lower than the maximally effective dose for MP. The efficacy of U74006F is unchanged if treatment is initiated within 4 h of injury. However, if treatment is delayed for 8 h, the therapeutic potency of U74006F is substantially reduced. These findings suggest that antioxidant therapy can successfully limit the effects of both experimental and clinical spinal cord injury especially if the treatment is initiated shortly after injury.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

One hour after trauma, the severely injured animals were treated either with U74006F, 3 mg/kg, methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg, or vehicle, whereas the moderately injured animals received U74006F, 3 mg/kg or vehicle.

A growing body of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological evidence has suggested that oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, working in concert with aberrant calcium fluxes and eicosanoid generation in particular, plays a key role in progressive post-traumatic spinal cord degeneration. Of particular importance, lipid peroxidation has been linked to microvascular damage and hypoperfusion which, if severe enough, can lead to a secondary ischemic insult to the tissue. The ability of intensive dosing with the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone to beneficially affect post-traumatic ischemia and to promote chronic neurologic recovery in spinal cord injured animals has been correlated not with its glucocorticoid activity, but rather with the ability to inhibit post-traumatic spinal lipid peroxidation. In view of this, a novel series of non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroids has been developed which lack glucocorticoid activity but are more effective inhibitors of nervous tissue lipid peroxidation than the glucocorticoid steroids. One of these, U74006F, has now been studied in some detail and appears to be a promising new agent for the acute treatment of spinal cord (and brain) trauma. The background and pre-clinical development of this compound to date is reviewed.","methylprednisolone","pubmed"

Pretreatment with either MPSS or alpha-tocopherol and Se also completely prevented the trauma-induced loss of cholesterol while inhibiting the increase of a cholesterol peroxidation product, 25-hydroxycholesterol.

In the case of methylprednisolone, the minimal intravenous dosage required to initially achieve each of these effects is in the range of 15 to 30 mg per kilogram of body weight, which is beyond that used currently for neurosurgical purposes.

Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole--after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), phenytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p<0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment.

Central myelinated axons are damaged by anoxia/ischemia in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Leakage of Na+ into the axoplasm through Na+ channels causes Ca2+ overload mainly by reverse Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Na+ channel blockers have thus been shown to be protective in an in vitro anoxic rat optic nerve model. Mexiletine (10 microM-1 mM), an antiarrhythmic and use-dependent Na+ channel blocker, was also significantly protective, as measured by recovery of the compound action potential after a 60 min anoxic exposure in vitro. More importantly, mexiletine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly protected optic nerves from injury in a model of in situ ischemia. This in situ model is more clinically relevant as it addresses drug pharmacokinetics, toxicity and CNS penetration. Optic nerve recovery cycles (defined as shifts in latency of compound action potentials with paired stimulation) were used to measure the concentration of mexiletine in optic nerves after systemic administration, estimated at approximately 42 microM 1 h after a single dose of 80 mg/kg, i.p.

Additionally, sumatriptan and minocycline similarly attenuated the mechanical and thermal allodynia in SCI (P < 0.001). TNF-α, IL-1β and CGRP levels in sumatriptan- and minocycline-treated groups significantly (P < 0.001) decreased compared to controls. Histopathological analysis also revealed a markedly improvement in hemorrhage followed by inflammatory cell invasion, neuronal vacuolation, and cyst formation in both sumatriptan- and minocycline-treated groups compared to control animals. Sumatriptan improves functional recovery from SCI through its anti-inflammatory effects and reducing pro-inflammatory and pain mediators.","minocycline","pubmed"

Following SCI pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase at the lesion site and play important roles in secondary tissue damage. Methylprednisolone (MP) is a glucocorticoid, and minocycline is a tetracycline-derived antibiotic both with neuroprotective effects on central nervous system trauma. However, there are limited studies on their effects on SCI. In this study, we aimed to evaluate effects of MP+minocycline combined treatment on cellular distribution and localization of TNF-α And IL-6 after SCI. Eighty Wistar rats were divided into three main groups as the intact control group, sham operation group, and experimental control group that received spinal cord compression injury. Following the injury, the experimental control group was subdivided into four groups as control, methylprednisolone treatment, minocycline treatment and, MP+minocycline combined treatment groups. Tissue samples were obtained from all groups at 24 hours and 72 hours after the injury. We found a significant decrease in TNF-α And IL-6 expressions in combined treatment group at 24 hours after injury. Also, there was a significant decrease in MDA and increase in SOD levels in this group. Furthermore, decreased lipid peroxidation and neuronal and glial cell death were also observed in combined treatment group. These results suggest that MP+minocycline combined treatment promotes functional recovery and, it should be considered as an effective treatment protocol following SCI.","minocycline","pubmed"

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of minocycline, a promising agent for post-injury treatment, prophylactic administration. In a rat model of SCI through contusion injury, T9 vertebra laminectomy was performed on 40 Sprague-Dawley male rats provided from Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). The reason behind selecting only male rats in our study was the fact that menstrual cycle of female rats affects healing process. Rodents were divided into a sham-operated group, a control group receiving only saline, a minocycline-treated group, and a minocycline pretreated group. Locomotor scaling, behavioral tests for neuropathic pain, and weight changes were evaluated and compared through a 28-days period. At the end of the study, tissue samples were taken to assess neuroinflammatory cytokine and histopathological changes. Minocycline pretreatment was as effective as its post-SCI administration regarding locomotor activity recovery, mechanical pain, and thermal allodynia. Furthermore, spinal cord inflammation and histopathological alterations were both similar in pretreatment and treatment groups indicating substantially better status. None of the treatments could have completely restore or prevent the spinal cord damage. Minocycline pretreatment can show promising therapeutic effects similar to its post-injury administration, inhibiting inflammatory microglial activity.","minocycline","pubmed"

Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations.","minocycline","pubmed"

Treatment of SCI still remains a tremendous challenge clinically. Minocycline could target comprehensive secondary injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a known sealing agent, is able to seal the damaged cell membranes and reduce calcium influx, thereby exerting neuroprotective capacity. Here, an E-selectin-targeting sialic acid - polyethylene glycol - poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SAPP) copolymer was designed for delivering hydrophobic minocycline to achieve combinational therapy of SCI. The obtained SAPP copolymer could self-assemble into micelles with critical micelle concentration being of 13.40 μg/mL, and effectively encapsulate hydrophobic minocycline. The prepared drug-loaded micelles (SAPPM) displayed sustained drug release over 72 h, which could stop microglia activation and exhibited excellent neuroprotective capacity in vitro. The SAPP micelles were efficiently accumulated in the lesion site of SCI rats via the specific binding between sialic acid and E-selectin. Due to the targeting distribution and combinational effect between PEG and minocycline, SAPPM could obviously reduce the area of lesion cavity, and realize more survival of axons and myelin sheaths from the injury, thus distinctly improving hindlimb functional recovery of SCI rats and conferring superior therapeutic effect in coparison with other groups. Our work presented an effective and safe strategy for SCI targeting therapy. Besides, neuroprotective capacity of PEG deserves further investigation on other central nervous system diseases.","minocycline","pubmed"

However, MH is only neuroprotective at high concentrations that cannot be achieved by systemic administration, which limits its clinical efficacy. We have developed a hydrogel-based MH delivery system that can be injected into the intrathecal space for local delivery of high concentrations of MH, without damaging spinal cord tissue. Implantation of MH hydrogel after unilateral level-C4/5 contusion SCI robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by in vivo recordings of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and electromyography (EMG) amplitudes. MH hydrogel also decreased lesion size and degeneration of cervical motor neuron somata, demonstrating its central neuroprotective effects within the injured cervical spinal cord. Furthermore, MH hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by the axons of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by both detailed neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from the diaphragm using cholera toxin B (CTB).

In this experimental study, adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. Rats received an intraperitoneal injection of minocycline immediately after SCI, and then 24 hours after the injury. Transplantations were performed 7 days after the injury. Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale (BBB).

Spinally-injured patients receive opioids within hours of arrival at the emergency room, and prolonged opioid regimens are often employed for the management of post-SCI chronic pain. However, previous studies in our laboratory suggest that the effects of opioids such as morphine may be altered in the pathophysiological context of neurotrauma. Specifically, we have shown that morphine administration in a rodent model of SCI increases mortality and tissue loss at the injury site, and decreases recovery of motor and sensory function, and overall health, even weeks after treatment. The literature suggests that opioids may produce these adverse effects by acting as endotoxins and increasing glial activation and inflammation. To better understand the effects of morphine following SCI, in this study we used flow cytometry to assess immune-competent cells at the lesion site. We observed a morphine-induced increase in the overall number of CD11b+ cells, with marked effects on microglia, in SCI subjects. Next, to investigate whether this increase in the inflammatory profile is necessary to produce morphine's effects, we challenged morphine treatment with minocycline. We found that pre-treatment with minocycline reduced the morphine-induced increase in microglia at the lesion site. More importantly, minocycline also blocked the adverse effects of morphine on recovery of function without disrupting the analgesic efficacy of this opioid. Together, our findings suggest that following SCI, morphine may exacerbate the inflammatory response, increasing cell death at the lesion site and negatively affecting functional recovery.","minocycline","pubmed"

Inhibitory factors in the lesion scar and poor intrinsic neural regeneration capacity restrict functional recovery after injury. Minocycline, which has neuroprotective activity, can alleviate secondary injury, but the long-term administration of this drug may cause toxicity. Polysialic acid (PSA) is a large cell-surface carbohydrate that is critical for central nervous system development and is capable of promoting precursor cell migration, axon path finding, and synaptic remodeling; thus, PSA plays a vital role in tissue repair and regeneration. Here, we developed a PSA-based minocycline-loaded nanodrug delivery system (PSM) for the synergistic therapy of spinal cord injury. The prepared PSM exerted marked anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities both in vitro and in vivo. The administration of PSM could significantly protect neurons and myelin sheaths from damage, reduce the formation of glial scar, recruit endogenous neural stem cells to the lesion site, and promote the regeneration of neurons and the extension of long axons throughout the glial scar, thereby largely improving the locomotor function of SCI rats and exerting a superior therapeutic effect.

Treatments aimed at preserving neuronal function through anti-inflammatory pathways (i.e., neuroprotection) have been a mainstay of pre-clinical SCI research for decades. Minocycline, a clinically available antibiotic agent with anti-inflammatory properties, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects in a variety of animal models and improved motor recovery in a Phase-2 human trial. Here, we leveraged our recently developed T3 severe contusion model in the rat to determine the ability of minocycline to preserve descending sympathoexcitatory axons and improve cardiovascular control after SCI. Forty-one male Wistar rats were randomized to either a treatment group (minocycline; n = 20) or a control group (vehicle; n = 21). All rats received a severe T3 contusion. Minocycline (or vehicle) was administered intraperitoneally at one hour post-injury (90 mg/kg), then every 12 h for two weeks (45 mg/kg). Neuroanatomical correlates (lesion area, descending sympathoexcitatory axons) were assessed, in addition to an assessment of cardiovascular control (hemodynamics, autonomic dysreflexia) and motor behavior. Here, we show that minocycline reduces lesion area, increases the number of descending sympathoexctitatory axons traversing the injury site, and ultimately reduces the severity of autonomic dysreflexia. Finally, we show that autonomic dysreflexia is a more sensitive marker of treatment stratification than motor function.","minocycline","pubmed"

These results were compatible with minocycline effect on SCI (p > 0.05). While metformin led to weight loss, both metformin and minocycline significantly decreased neuroinflammation in the assessment of cord tissue histopathology, and levels of TNF-α and interleukin-1β (p < 0.001).

It has been shown to target multiple secondary injury mechanisms in spinal cord injury, via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The secondary injury mechanisms that MH can potentially target include inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, ischemia, hemorrhage, and edema. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of the multifaceted actions of MH. Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are partially achieved through conserved mechanisms such as modulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways as well as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Additionally, MH can directly inhibit calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mitochondrial calcium uptake, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzymatic activity, and iron toxicity. It can also directly scavenge free radicals. Because it can target many secondary injury mechanisms, MH treatment holds great promise for reducing tissue damage and promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury.","minocycline","pubmed"

Expediently delivering interventions during the early postinjury period can have a tremendous impact on long-term functional recovery. This is largely due to the unique pathophysiology of SCI where the initial traumatic insult (primary injury) is followed by a progressive secondary injury cascade characterized by ischemia, proapoptotic signaling, and peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration. Over the subsequent hours, release of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic debris (DNA, ATP, reactive oxygen species) cyclically adds to the harsh postinjury microenvironment. As the lesions mature into the chronic phase, regeneration is severely impeded by the development of an astroglial-fibrous scar surrounding coalesced cystic cavities. Addressing these challenges forms the basis of current and upcoming treatments for SCI. This paper discusses the evidence-based management of a patient with SCI while emphasizing the importance of early definitive care. Key neuroprotective therapies are summarized including surgical decompression, methylprednisolone, and blood pressure augmentation.

However, most current treatment strategies only target one or a few elements in the injury cascades, and have been largely unsuccessful in clinical trials. Minocycline hydrochloride (MH) is a clinically available antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drug that has been shown to target a broad range of secondary injury mechanisms via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, MH is only neuroprotective at high concentrations. The inability to translate the high doses of MH used in experimental animals to tolerable doses in human patients limits its clinical efficacy. In addition, the duration of MH treatment is limited because long-term systemic administration of high doses of MH has been shown to cause liver toxicity and even death. We have developed a drug delivery system in the form of hydrogel loaded with polysaccharide-MH complexes self-assembled by metal ions for controlled release of MH. This drug delivery system can be injected into the intrathecal space for local delivery of MH with sufficient dose and duration, without causing any additional tissue damage. We show that local delivery of MH at a dose that is lower than the standard human dose (3 mg/kg) was more effective in reducing secondary injury and promoting locomotor functional recovery than systemic injection of MH with the highest dose and duration reported in experimental animal SCI (90-135 mg/kg).","minocycline","pubmed"

Young adult male rats were subjected to experimental SCI by weight compression method. Minocycline (50mg/kg) and FK506 (1mg/kg) were administered orally in combination and individually to the SCI group daily for three weeks. During these three weeks, the recovery was measured using behavioral motor parameters (including BBB, Tarlov and other scorings) every other day for 29days after SCI. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the segment of the spinal cord centered at the injury site was removed for the histopathological studies as well as for biochemical analysis of monoamines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and some oxidative stress indices, such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), total glutathione (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). All behavioral results indicated that both drugs induced significant recovery from SCI with respect to time. The biochemical and histopathological results supported the behavioral findings, revealing significant recovery in the regeneration of the injured spinal tissues, the monoamine levels, and the oxidative stress indices. Overall, the effects of the tested drugs for SCI recovery were as follows: FK506+minocycline>minocycline>FK506 in all studied parameters. Thus, minocycline and FK506 may prove to be a potential therapy cocktail to treat acute SCI. However, further studies are warranted.","minocycline","pubmed"

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI.","minocycline","pubmed"

A spinal contusion was made at the T12 spinal segment in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using the NYU impactor. Behavioral tests for motor function were conducted before and after SCI and before and after TENS application. To assess spasticity, the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) was used before and after SCI, high-frequency (HF)/low-frequency (LF) TENS application at 3 different intensities (motor threshold [MT], 50% and 90% MT) or minocycline administration. Immunohistochemistry for microglia was performed at the lumbar spinal segments. Motor recovery reached a plateau approximately 28 days after SCI. Spasticity was well developed and was sustained above the MAS grade of 3, beginning at 28 days after SCI. HF-TENS at 90% MT significantly alleviated spasticity. Motor function did not show any significant changes with LF- or HF-TENS treatment. HF-TENS significantly reduced the proportion of activated microglia observed after SCI. Minocycline, the microglia inhibitor, also significantly alleviated spasticity with the reduction of activated microglia expression. These results suggest that HF-TENS at 90% MT alleviates spasticity in rats with SCI by inhibiting activated microglia.","minocycline","pubmed"

IL-10 also provides trophic support to neurons through the IL-10 receptor.

Treatment of SCI with IL-10 has been used successfully in combination with Schwann cell and olfactory glial cell grafts, as well as methylprednisolone. Minocycline, tetramethylpyrazine, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment all increase IL-10 levels in a SCI models and result in increased tissue sparing and functional recovery. A chronic systemic administration of IL-10 does not appear to be beneficial to SCI recovery and causes increased susceptibility to septicemia, pneumonia, and peripheral neuropathy. However, a localized upregulation of IL-10 has been shown to be beneficial and can be achieved by herpes simplex virus gene therapy, injection of poliovirus replicons, or surgical placement of a slow-release compound. IL-10 shows promise as a treatment for SCI, although research on local IL-10 delivery timeline and dosage needs to be expanded.","minocycline","pubmed"

To evaluate the short- and long-term neuroprotective effects of minocycline on the secondary injury process of an experimental traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) model. Traumatic SCI is a devastating problem of health that results in high morbidity and mortality rates. The loss of function after SCI results from both the primary mechanical insult and the subsequent, multifaceted secondary response. A total of 80 adult male Spraque-Dawley rats (breeded by the Baskent University Animal Research Center) were randomly divided into 4 groups. A T10 contusion injury was produced by using modified Allen technique in all groups except the control group. No medication was administered to the rats in the trauma group. Minocycline was administered intraperitoneally and intravenously to the treatment groups. Short-term and/or long-term neuroprotective effects of minocycline on the lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, glutathione), apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling), ultrastructure of spinal cord (tissue electron microscopy), and behavioral assessments (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan) were evaluated. As compared with the trauma group, tissue malondialdehyde and glutathione levels demonstrated that minocycline significantly diminishes lipid peroxidation. Electromicroscopic study showed that minocycline preserves the ultrastructure of spinal cord tissue in the early post-traumatic period. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling positive cells both 1 day and 28 days after SCI. Behavioral assessments showed significant improvement in the hind limb functions of minocycline receiving rats starting 7 days after the SCI. Any statistically significant difference was not found between intraperitoneal or intravenous routes for minocycline injection. Minocycline is neuroprotective and contributes to functional improvement after traumatic SCI by eliminating the destructive process of secondary injury. Having both satisfying anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in experimental models, it promises to be of therapeutic use in human SCI.","minocycline","pubmed"

Animal studies and early clinical trials support its use in several neurological diseases. In animal spinal cord injury models, minocycline improved neurological and histological outcomes, reduced neuronal and oligodendroglial apoptosis, decreased microglial activation and reduced inflammation. A single-centre, human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of minocycline administration after spinal cord injury was undertaken for the purposes of dose optimization, safety assessment and to estimate outcome changes and variance. Neurological, functional, pharmacological and adverse event outcomes were compared between subjects administered 7 days of intravenous minocycline (n = 27) or placebo (n = 25) after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The secondary outcome used to assess neurological differences between groups that may warrant further investigation was motor recovery over 1 year using the American Spinal Cord Injury Association examination. Recruitment and analyses were stratified by injury severity and injury location a priori given the expected influence of these on the sensitivity of the motor exam. Minocycline administered at higher than previously reported human doses produced steady-state concentrations of 12.7 µg/ml (95% confidence interval 11.6-13.8) in serum and 2.3 µg/ml (95% confidence interval 2.1-2.5) in cerebrospinal fluid, mimicking efficacious serum levels measured in animal studies. Transient elevation of serum liver enzymes in one patient was the only adverse event likely related to the study drug. Overall, patients treated with minocycline experienced six points greater motor recovery than those receiving placebo (95% confidence interval -3 to 14; P = 0.20, n = 44). No difference in recovery was observed for thoracic spinal cord injury (n = 16). A difference of 14 motor points that approached significance was observed in patients with cervical injury (95% confidence interval 0-28; P = 0.05, n = 25). Patients with cervical motor-incomplete injury may have experienced a larger difference (results not statistically significant, n = 9). Functional outcomes exhibited differences that lacked statistical significance but that may be suggestive of improvement in patients receiving the study drug. The minocycline regimen established in this study proved feasible, safe and was associated with a tendency towards improvement across several outcome measures. Although this study does not establish the efficacy of minocycline in spinal cord injury the findings are encouraging and warrant further investigation in a multi-centre phase III trial.

Both anti-inflammatory drugs caused an improvement in hindlimb locomotor function over the 2-week treatment, as measured by the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS). The improvement was functionally important, with mice having problems with coordinated stepping (BMS ∼6) before treatment to walking essentially normally (BMS >7) at the end of the treatment. The effects diminished within 1 week after termination of the treatments, suggesting an ongoing and dynamic inflammatory process. The area of white matter or the inflammatory markers CD68 for activated microglia/macrophages and CD45 for leukocytes were not different between the groups.

Spinal cord injury was produced by contusion using the New York University impactor (25 g-cm, at the 9th-10th thoracic). Functional evaluations were done using the inclined plane test and a motor rating scale. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling staining technique (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining of cord tissues obtained at 7 days post-injury. Pregabalin treated animals showed significantly better functional recovery, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects.

Here, we show that minocycline improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing apoptosis of oligodendrocytes via inhibition of proNGF production in microglia. After SCI, the stress-responsive p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was activated only in microglia, and proNGF was produced by microglia via the p38MAPK-mediated pathway. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced proNGF production in microglia in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Furthermore, minocycline treatment inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor expression and RhoA activation after injury.

A combination of growth factors, the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline, and cyclosporine A immunosuppression was used to enhance the survival of transplanted adult NPCs. Our results show the presence of a substantial number of surviving NPCs in the injured spinal cord up to 10 weeks after transplantation at the subacute stage of SCI. In contrast, cell survival was poor after transplantation into chronic lesions. After subacute transplantation, grafted cells migrated >5 mm rostrally and caudally. The surviving NPCs integrated principally along white-matter tracts and displayed close contact with the host axons and glial cells. Approximately 50% of grafted cells formed either oligodendroglial precursor cells or mature oligodendrocytes. NPC-derived oligodendrocytes expressed myelin basic protein and ensheathed the axons. We also observed that injured rats receiving NPC transplants had improved functional recovery as assessed by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale and grid-walk and footprint analyses.

Adult rats were subjected to a C7-C8 dorsal column transection, and the presence of apoptotic oligodendrocytes was assessed within the ascending sensory tract (AST) and descending CST in segments (3-7 mm) both proximal and distal to the injury site. Surprisingly, the numbers of dying oligodendrocytes in the proximal and distal segments were comparable, suggesting more than the lack of axon-cell body contiguity played a role in their demise. Minocycline or vehicle control was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity 30 min and 8 hr after SCI and thereafter twice daily for 2 d. We report a reduction of apoptotic oligodendrocytes and microglia within both proximal and distal segments of the AST after minocycline treatment, using immunostaining for active caspase-3 and Hoechst 33258 staining in combination with cell-specific markers. Activated microglial/macrophage density was reduced remote to the lesion as well as at the lesion site. Both CST dieback and lesion size were diminished after minocycline treatment.

Based on previous reports, minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, exerts neuroprotection partially by inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c release and reactive microgliosis. We first evaluated cytochrome c release at the injury epicenter after a T10 contusive SCI in rats. Cytochrome c release peaked at approximately 4-8 h postinjury. A dose-response study generated a safe pharmacological regimen that enabled i.p. minocycline to significantly lower cytosolic cytochrome c at the epicenter 4 h after SCI. In the long-term study, i.p. minocycline (90 mg/kg administered 1 h after SCI followed by 45 mg/kg administered every 12 h for 5 days) markedly enhanced long-term hind limb locomotion relative to that of controls. Coordinated motor function and hind limb reflex recoveries also were improved significantly. Histopathology suggested that minocycline treatment alleviated later-phase tissue loss, with significant sparing of white matter and ventral horn motoneurons at levels adjacent to the epicenter. Furthermore, glial fibrillary acidic protein and 2',3' cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase immunocytochemistry showed an evident reduction in astrogliosis and enhanced survival of oligodendrocytes. Therefore, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c is an important secondary injury mechanism in SCI. Drugs with multifaceted effects in antagonizing this process and microgliosis may protect a proportion of spinal cord tissue that is clinically significant for functional recovery. Minocycline, with its proven clinical safety, capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrated efficacy during a clinically relevant therapeutic window, may become an effective therapy for acute SCI.","minocycline","pubmed"

Twenty four to 38 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in minocycline-treated rats as compared with those in vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion size increased progressively in both vehicle-treated and minocycline-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with minocycline, the lesion size was significantly reduced at 21-38 days after SCI when compared to the vehicle control. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells 24 h after SCI as compared to that of the vehicle control.

Spinally-injured patients receive opioids within hours of arrival at the emergency room, and prolonged opioid regimens are often employed for the management of post-SCI chronic pain. However, previous studies in our laboratory suggest that the effects of opioids such as morphine may be altered in the pathophysiological context of neurotrauma. Specifically, we have shown that morphine administration in a rodent model of SCI increases mortality and tissue loss at the injury site, and decreases recovery of motor and sensory function, and overall health, even weeks after treatment. The literature suggests that opioids may produce these adverse effects by acting as endotoxins and increasing glial activation and inflammation. To better understand the effects of morphine following SCI, in this study we used flow cytometry to assess immune-competent cells at the lesion site. We observed a morphine-induced increase in the overall number of CD11b+ cells, with marked effects on microglia, in SCI subjects. Next, to investigate whether this increase in the inflammatory profile is necessary to produce morphine's effects, we challenged morphine treatment with minocycline. We found that pre-treatment with minocycline reduced the morphine-induced increase in microglia at the lesion site. More importantly, minocycline also blocked the adverse effects of morphine on recovery of function without disrupting the analgesic efficacy of this opioid. Together, our findings suggest that following SCI, morphine may exacerbate the inflammatory response, increasing cell death at the lesion site and negatively affecting functional recovery.","morphine","pubmed"

Rodent models could help identify how SCI pain develops, explore new treatment strategies, and reveal whether acute post-SCI morphine worsens chronic pain. However, few studies explore or compare SCI-elicited neuropathic pain in rats. Here, we sought to determine how different clinically relevant contusion SCIs in male and female rats affect neuropathic pain, and whether acute morphine worsens later chronic SCI pain. First, female rats received sham surgery, or 150kDyn or 200kDyn midline T9 contusion SCI. These rats displayed modest mechanical allodynia and long-lasting thermal hyperalgesia. Next, a 150kDyn (1s dwell) midline contusion SCI was performed in male and female rats. Interestingly, males, but not females showed SCI-elicited mechanical allodynia; rats of both sexes had thermal hyperalgesia. In this model, acute morphine treatment had no significant effect on chronic neuropathic pain symptoms. Unilateral SCIs can also elicit neuropathic pain that could be exacerbated by morphine, so male rats received unilateral T13 contusion SCI (100kDyn). These rats exhibited significant, transient mechanical allodynia, but not thermal hyperalgesia. Acute morphine did not exacerbate chronic pain.

In a clinically relevant spinal cord contusion injury model, prior work has shown that noxious stimulation at an intensity that engages pain (C) fibers soon after injury augments secondary injury and impairs functional recovery. Noxious input increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β and 18), cellular signals associated with cell death (caspase 3 and 8), and physiological signs of hemorrhage. Here, it is shown that reducing neural excitability after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the local anesthetic lidocaine (micro-injected by means of a lumbar puncture) blocks these adverse cellular effects. In contrast, treatment with an analgesic dose of morphine had no effect. Contused rats that received nociceptive stimulation soon after injury exhibited poor locomotor recovery, less weight gain, and greater tissue loss at the site of injury. Prophylactic application of lidocaine blocked the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation on behavioral recovery and reduced tissue loss from secondary injury. The results suggest that quieting neural excitability using lidocaine can reduce the adverse effect of pain input (from polytrauma or surgery) after SCI.","morphine","pubmed"

Despite its analgesic efficacy, however, our studies suggest that intrathecal morphine undermines locomotor recovery and increases lesion size in a rodent model of SCI. Similarly, intravenous (IV) morphine attenuates locomotor recovery. The current study explores whether IV morphine also increases lesion size after a spinal contusion (T12) injury and quantifies the cell types that are affected by early opioid administration. Using an experimenter-administered escalating dose of IV morphine across the first seven days post-injury, we quantified the expression of neuron, astrocyte, and microglial markers at the injury site. SCI decreased NeuN expression relative to shams. In subjects with SCI treated with IV morphine, virtually no NeuN+ cells remained across the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion. Further, whereas SCI per se increased the expression of astrocyte and microglial markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein and OX-42, respectively), morphine treatment decreased the expression of these markers. These cellular changes were accompanied by attenuation of locomotor recovery (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores), decreased weight gain, and the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (increased tactile reactivity) in morphine-treated subjects. These data suggest that morphine use is contraindicated in the acute phase of a spinal injury. Faced with a lifetime of intractable pain, however, simply removing any effective analgesic for the management of SCI pain is not an ideal option. Instead, these data underscore the critical need for further understanding of the molecular pathways engaged by conventional medications within the pathophysiological context of an injury.","morphine","pubmed"

Unfortunately, we have shown that morphine administered in the acute phase of SCI results in significant, adverse secondary consequences including compromised locomotor and sensory recovery. Similarly, we showed that selective activation of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), even at a dose 32-fold lower than morphine, is sufficient to attenuate recovery of locomotor function. In the current study, we tested whether activation of the KOR is necessary to produce morphine's adverse effects using nor-Binaltorphimine (norBNI), a selective KOR antagonist. Rats received a moderate spinal contusion (T12) and 24 h later, baseline locomotor function and nociceptive reactivity were assessed. Rats were then administered norBNI (0, 0.02, 0.08, or 0.32 μmol) followed by morphine (0 or 0.32 μmol). Nociception was reassessed 30 min after drug treatment, and recovery was evaluated for 21 days. The effects of norBNI on morphine-induced attenuation of recovery were dose dependent. At higher doses, norBNI blocked the adverse effects of morphine on locomotor recovery, but analgesia was also significantly decreased. Conversely, at low doses, analgesia was maintained, but the adverse effects on recovery persisted. A moderate dose of norBNI, however, adequately protected against morphine's adverse effects without eliminating its analgesic efficacy. This suggests that activation of the KOR system plays a significant role in the morphine-induced attenuation of recovery. Our research suggests that morphine, and other opioid analgesics, may be contraindicated for the SCI population. Blocking KOR activity may be a viable strategy for improving the safety of clinical opioid use.","morphine","pubmed"

Current therapies for treating this type of pain are ineffective and often have dose-limiting side effects. Although opioids are one of the most commonly used CNP treatments, recent animal literature has indicated that administering opioids shortly after a traumatic injury can actually have deleterious effects on long-term health and recovery. In order to study the deleterious effects of administering morphine shortly after trauma, we employed our low thoracic (T13) dorsal root avulsion model (Spinal Neuropathic Avulsion Pain, SNAP). Administering a weeklong course of 10mg/kg/day morphine beginning 24h after SNAP resulted in amplified mechanical allodynia. Co-administering the non-opioid toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist (+)-naltrexone throughout the morphine regimen prevented morphine-induced amplification of SNAP. Exploration of changes induced by early post-trauma morphine revealed that this elevated gene expression of TLR4, TNF, IL-1β, and NLRP3, as well as IL-1β protein at the site of spinal cord injury. These data suggest that a short course of morphine administered early after spinal trauma can exacerbate CNP in the long term. TLR4 initiates this phenomenon and, as such, may be potential therapeutic targets for preventing the deleterious effects of administering opioids after traumatic injury.","morphine","pubmed"

We used specific opioid receptor agonists to assess the effects of μ- (DAMGO), δ- (DPDPE) and κ- (GR89696) opioid receptor activation on locomotor (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale, tapered beam and ladder tests) and sensory (girdle, tactile and tail-flick tests) recovery in a rodent contusion model (T12). We also tested the contribution of non-classic opioid binding using [+]- morphine. First, a dose-response curve for analgesic efficacy was generated for each opioid agonist. Baseline locomotor and sensory reactivity was assessed 24 h after injury. Subjects were then treated with an intrathecal dose of a specific agonist and re-tested after 30 min. To evaluate the effects on recovery, subjects were treated with a single dose of an agonist and both locomotor and sensory function were monitored for 21 days. All agonists for the classic opioid receptors, but not the [+]- morphine enantiomer, produced antinociception at a concentration equivalent to a dose of morphine previously shown to produce strong analgesic effects (0.32 μmol). DAMGO and [+]- morphine did not affect long-term recovery. GR89696, however, significantly undermined the recovery of locomotor function at all doses tested. On the basis of these data, we hypothesize that the analgesic efficacy of morphine is primarily mediated by binding to the classic μ-opioid receptor. Conversely, the adverse effects of morphine may be linked to activation of the κ-opioid receptor.

Previous reports showed that SCI results in the induction and suppression of several microRNAs (miRNAs), both at the site of injury, as well as in segments of the spinal cord distal to the injury site. We hypothesized that morphine would modulate the expression of these miRNAs, and that expression of these SCI-sensitive miRNAs may predict adaptation of distal nociceptive circuitry following SCI. To determine whether morphine treatment further dysregulates SCI-sensitive miRNAs, their expression was examined by qRT-PCR in sham controls and in response to vehicle and morphine treatment following contusion in rats, at either 2 or 15 days post-SCI. Our data indicated that expression of miR1, miR124, and miR129-2 at the injury site predicted the nociceptive response mediated by spinal regions distal to the lesion site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the interaction of SCI with adaptation of functionally intact distal sensorimotor circuitry. Moreover, the SCI-induced miRNA, miR21 was induced by subsequent morphine administration, representing an alternate, and hitherto unidentified, maladaptive response to morphine exposure. Contrary to predictions, mRNA for the pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R), an identified target of SCI-sensitive miRNAs, was also induced following SCI, indicating dissociation between miRNA and target gene expression. Moreover, IL6R mRNA expression was inversely correlated with locomotor function suggesting that inflammation is a predictor of decreased spinal cord function. Collectively, our data indicate that miR21 and other SCI-sensitive miRNAs may constitute therapeutic targets, not only for improving functional recovery following SCI, but also for attenuating the effects of SCI on pain sensitivity.","morphine","pubmed"

There is concern surrounding the use of these analgesics, however, because use is often associated with the development of addiction. Previous data suggests that this concern may not be relevant in the presence of neuropathic pain. Yet, despite the common prescription of opioids for the treatment of SCI-related pain, there has been only one previous study examining the addictive potential of morphine following spinal injury. To address this, the present study used a self-administration paradigm to examine the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI. Animals were placed into self-administration chambers 24 h, 14 d, or 35 d following a moderate spinal contusion injury. They were placed into the chambers for seven 12-hour sessions with access to 1.5 mg morphine/lever depression (up to 30 mg/d). In the acute phase of SCI, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than their sham counterparts, as previously shown. However, contused animals showing signs of neuropathic pain did not self-administer less morphine than their sham counterparts when administration began 14 or 35 d after injury. Instead, these animals administered nearly the full amount of morphine available each session. This amount of morphine did not affect recovery of locomotor function but did cause significant weight loss. We suggest caution is warranted when prescribing opioids for the treatment of neuropathic pain resulting from SCI, as the addictive potential is not reduced in this model.","morphine","pubmed"

However, the use of morphine after a spinal cord injury (SCI) can potentiate the development of paradoxical pain symptoms, and continuous administration can lead to dependence, tolerance, and addiction. Although some studies suggest that the addictive potential of morphine decreases when it is used to treat neuropathic pain, this has not been studied in a SCI model. Accordingly, the present studies investigated the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI using conditioned place preference (CPP) and intravenous self-administration paradigms. A contusion injury significantly increased the expression of a CPP relative to sham and intact controls in the acute phase of injury. However, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than sham and intact controls, but this was dose-dependent; at a high concentration, injured rats exhibited an increase in drug-reinforced responses over time. Exposure to a high concentration of morphine impeded weight gain and locomotor recovery. We suggest that the increased preference observed in injured rats reflects a motivational effect linked in part to the drug's anti-nociceptive effect. Further, although injured rats exhibited a suppression of opiate self-administration, when given access to a high concentration, addictive-like behavior emerged and was associated with poor recovery.","morphine","pubmed"

Two-hundred and one patients were randomized to 1 of 4 analgesic epidural pastes at the time of lumbar spinal surgery: combination paste (morphine + methylprednisolone), steroid paste (methylprednisolone alone), morphine paste (morphine alone), or placebo. The primary outcome measures used were analgesic consumption and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Secondary outcome measures were: modified American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) score, Short Form 36 General Health Survey (SF-36), Aberdeen Pain Index (ABPI), time to ambulation and time to discharge from hospital. Administration of combination and steroid paste, but not morphine paste, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI) components of the MPQ in the first 3 days after surgery. Likewise, postoperative in-patient narcotic analgesic consumption was reduced in the combination paste and steroid paste group, but not in the morphine paste group. No difference in time to ambulation or discharge, SF-36 scores, ABPI scores, or neurologic recovery was observed. An analgesic paste containing methylprednisolone acetate is effective at reducing postoperative pain after lumbar decompressive surgery. Mixing effective doses of morphine sulfate in the paste abrogates the expected analgesic effects of epidural morphine.","morphine","pubmed"

Despite widespread use, however, little is known about the secondary consequences of morphine use after SCI. Unfortunately, our previous studies show that administration of a single dose of morphine, in the acute phase of a moderate spinal contusion injury, significantly attenuates locomotor function, reduces weight gain, and produces symptoms of paradoxical pain (Hook et al., 2009). The current study focused on the cellular mechanisms that mediate these effects. Based on data from other models, we hypothesized that pro-inflammatory cytokines might play a role in the morphine-induced attenuation of function. Experiment 1 confirmed that systemic morphine (20 mg/kg) administered one day after a contusion injury significantly increased expression levels of spinal IL-1β 24 h later. Experiment 2 extended these findings, demonstrating that a single dose of morphine (90 μg, i.t.) applied directly onto the spinal cord increased expression levels of spinal IL-1β at both 30 min and 24 h after administration. Experiment 3 showed that administration of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, i.t.) prior to intrathecal morphine (90 μg), blocked the adverse effects of morphine on locomotor recovery. Further, pre-treatment with 3 μg IL-1ra prevented the increased expression of at-level neuropathic pain symptoms that was observed 28 days later in the group treated with morphine-alone. However, the IL-1ra also had adverse effects that were independent of morphine. Treatment with the IL-1ra alone undermined recovery of locomotor function, potentiated weight loss and significantly increased tissue loss at the injury site. Overall, these data suggest that morphine disrupts a critical balance in concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, and this undermines recovery of function.","morphine","pubmed"

Moreover, a single dose of systemic morphine in the early stage of injury (24 h post-injury) led to symptoms of neuropathic pain 3 weeks later, in the chronic phase. The present study examines the locus of the effects using intrathecal morphine administration. Subjects were treated with one of three doses (0, 30, or 90 microg) of intrathecal morphine 24 h after a moderate contusion injury. The 90-microg dose produced significant analgesia when subjects were exposed to noxious stimuli (thermal and incremented shock) below the level of injury. Yet, despite analgesic efficacy, intrathecal morphine significantly attenuated the recovery of locomotor function and increased lesion size rostral to the injury site. A single dose of 30 or 90 microg of intrathecal morphine also decreased weight gain, and more than doubled the incidence of mortality and autophagia when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Morphine is one of the most effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain and, therefore, is indispensable for the spinally injured. Treatment can, however, adversely affect the recovery process.

These data imply that nociceptive input (e.g., from tissue damage) can enhance the loss of function after injury, and that potential clinical treatments, such as pretreatment with an analgesic, may protect the damaged system from further secondary injury. The current study examined this hypothesis and showed that a potential treatment (morphine) did not have a protective effect. In fact, morphine appeared to exacerbate the effects of nociceptive stimulation. Experiment 1 showed that after spinal cord injury 20mg/kg of systemic morphine was necessary to induce strong antinociception and block behavioral reactivity to shock treatment, a dose that was much higher than that needed for sham controls. In Experiment 2, contused rats were given one of three doses of morphine (Vehicle, 10, 20mg/kg) prior to exposure to uncontrollable electrical stimulation or restraint alone. Despite decreasing nociceptive reactivity, morphine did not attenuate the long-term consequences of shock. Rats treated with morphine and shock had higher mortality rates, and displayed allodynic responses to innocuous sensory stimuli three weeks later. Independent of shock, morphine per se undermined recovery of sensory function. Rats treated with morphine alone also had significantly larger lesions than those treated with saline. These results suggest that nociceptive stimulation affects recovery despite a blockade of pain-elicited behavior. The results are clinically important because they suggest that opiate treatment may adversely affect the recovery of function after injury.","morphine","pubmed"

Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome.

The lack of available robust pharmacological treatments underscores the need for novel therapeutic methods and approaches. Due to the complex character of neuropathic pain following SCI, therapies targeting multiple mechanisms may be a better choice for obtaining sufficient long-term pain relief. Previous studies in our lab showed analgesic effects using combinations of an NMDA antagonist peptide [Ser1]histogranin (SHG), and the mu-opioid peptides endomorphins (EMs), in several pain models. As an alternative to drug therapy, this study evaluated the analgesic potential of these peptides when delivered via gene therapy. Lentiviruses encoding SHG and EM-1 and EM-2 were intraspinally injected, either singly or in combination, into rats with clip compression SCI 2 weeks following injury. Treated animals showed significant reduction in mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, compared to control groups injected with GFP vector only. The antinociceptive effects of individually injected components were modest, but the combination of EMs and SHG produced robust and sustained antinociception. The onset of the analgesic effects was observed between 1-5 weeks post-injection and sustained without decrement for at least 7 weeks. No adverse effects on locomotor function were observed. The involvement of SHG and EMs in the observed antinociception was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition using intrathecal injection of either the opioid antagonist naloxone or an anti-SHG antibody. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of SHG and EMs in the spinal cord of treated animals, and immunodot-blot analysis of CSF confirmed the presence of these peptides in injected animals. In a separate group of rats, delayed injection of viral vectors was performed in order to mimic a more likely clinical scenario. Comparable and sustained antinociceptive effects were observed in these animals using the SHG-EMs combination vectors compared to the group with early intervention. Findings from this study support the potential for direct gene therapy to provide a robust and sustained alleviation of chronic neuropathic pain following SCI. The combination strategy utilizing potent mu-opioid peptides with a naturally-derived NMDA antagonist may produce additive or synergistic analgesic effects without the tolerance development for long-term management of persistent pain.","naloxone","pubmed"

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). In 1990 the results of the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS II) were published, which showed that the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP), which had been previously shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, could improve neurological recovery in spinal-cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI since the drug was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy was obtained in a third NASCIS trial (NASCIS III). In recent years, the use of high-dose MP in acute SCI has become controversial largely on the basis of the risk of serious adverse effects versus what is perceived to be on average a modest neurological benefit. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone was also tested in NASCIS II based upon the demonstration of its beneficial effects in SCI models. Although it did not a significant overall effect, some evidence of efficacy was seen in incomplete (i.e., paretic) patients. The monosialoganglioside GM1 has also been examined in a recently completed clinical trial in which the patients first received high-dose MP treatment. However, GM1 failed to show any evidence of a significant enhancement in the extent of neurological recovery over the level afforded by MP therapy alone. The present paper reviews the past development of MP, naloxone, tirilazad, and GM1 for acute SCI, the ongoing MP-SCI controversy, identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development, and suggests some promising neuroprotective approaches that could either replace or be used in combination with high-dose MP.","naloxone","pubmed"

Acute and chronic stages of injury were defined according to bladder function. Naloxone was given intravenously at both stages, and intrathecally at the acute stage. Bladder activity was monitored by cystometry. Blood concentrations of methionine-enkephalin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Spinal cord injuries were acute 1 or 2 days after surgery, and chronic after 1 or 2 weeks. Bladder capacity significantly decreased after 0.01 mg of intravenous naloxone in uninjured control rabbits, and after 0.03 mg of intravenous naloxone in rabbits with chronic-phase injuries. During the acute-injury phase, 0.3 mg of intravenous naloxone, or 0.02 mg of intrathecal naloxone, was necessary to evoke the micturition reflex. No significant changes in blood enkephalin levels were seen before or after spinal cord injury. In rabbits with acute spinal cord injury, intrathecal naloxone evoked the micturition reflex at a much lower dose than did intravenous naloxone. Intrathecal naloxone promises to become a new therapy for the acute stage of spinal cord injury for active recovery of bladder function, and could replace current therapy.","naloxone","pubmed"

Methylprednisolone treatment administered early following injury has been found to improve recovery below the lesion in patients initially diagnosed as having complete or incomplete injuries; it also leads to greater (but still relatively small) improvement in the injury level.

The delayed decline of evoked potentials and blood flow suggest secondary injury processes that may respond to pharmacological therapy. High dose methylprednisolone (15-30 mg/kg) dramatically improved blood flow, extracellular ionic shifts, blood flow, and evoked potentials in cat spinal cords. Methylprednisolone also decreased tissue ionic shifts and improved locomotory recovery. In concomitant experiments, we showed that naloxone also prevented posttraumatic declines in blood flow and improved locomotory recovery. Examination of the spinal cords at 6-12 weeks after injury, revealed that many recovered animals had only 10% of spinal cord axons remaining.

This report describes changes in micturition reflexes 2 h to 14 weeks following spinal cord transection at the lower thoracic level. In acute spinal cats micturition reflexes were blocked, however, several weeks after transection, a long latency (180-200 ms) spinal reflex could be activated by C-fiber bladder afferents. This reflex was blocked by capsaicin in doses (20-30 mg/kg, s.c.) that did not affect micturition reflexes in intact cats. Micturition reflexes were unmasked in acute spinal and facilitated in chronic spinal cats by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Spinal neurons and axons containing opioid peptides were more prominent below the level of transection in chronic spinal cats. VIP, a putative neurotransmitter in C-fiber bladder afferents, inhibited micturition reflexes when injected intrathecally (2-10 micrograms) in intact cats but facilitated micturition reflexes in spinal cats (doses 0.1-1 micrograms, i.t.). VIP-containing C-fiber afferent projections to lamina I of the sacral spinal cord expanded in spinal cats. Thus VIP afferents may have an important role in the recovery of bladder reflexes after spinal injury. Paraplegic animals also exhibit bladder-sphincter dyssynergia, which causes functional outlet obstruction. Studies in rats have revealed that outlet obstruction induced by partial urethral ligation facilitates spinal micturition reflex pathways and causes an expansion of HRP-labelled bladder afferent projections in the spinal cord. These findings raise the possibility that the alterations in central reflex connections in paraplegic animals may be induced in part by changes in peripheral afferent input secondary to outlet obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","naloxone","pubmed"

In a randomized blinded study, nalmefene treatment, given as a single i.v. bolus injection at 60 min posttrauma, significantly improved neurological recovery and reduced tissue damage. Beneficial actions were dose-related. The optimal dose was 0.1 mg/kg, with diminished effects at both higher and lower doses; this is approximately 1% of the optimal naloxone dose in SCI as shown from other studies.

TRH appears to be superior to naloxone in this regard, although direct comparisons between receptor-selective opiate receptor antagonists and TRH have not been made. Similarly, opiate antagonists are effective in improving outcome and reducing pathological changes following ischemic spinal cord injury in rabbits.

Effects of opiate antagonists in the treatment of experimental stroke have been more controversial, although the weight of evidence supports a therapeutic effect in various models and species.

The kappa receptor appears to be the predominant opiate receptor in the spinal cord in a variety of species. For these reasons we evaluated the effects of a somewhat kappa selective opiate receptor antagonist WIN44,441-3 [WIN(-)] on neurological recovery following traumatic spinal injury in the cat and ischemic spinal injury in the rabbit. Animals treated with this more selective antagonist showed improved motor recovery as compared with animals treated with either physiological saline or with the dextroisomer of the WIN compound [WIN44,441-2; WIN(+)].

In the cat, we have shown that beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity was increased in plasma following traumatic spinal injury; such injury was associated with a decrease in spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) which was reversed by the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone. Naloxone treatment also significantly improved functional neurological recovery after severe injury. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), possibly through its ""anti-endorphin"" actions, was even more effective than naloxone in improving functional recovery in the cat. In a rat model, utilizing a similar trauma method, TRH proved superior to naloxone in improving SCBF after injury. In addition, naloxone at high doses attenuated the hindlimb paralysis produced by temporary aortic occlusion in the rabbit. The high doses of naloxone required to improve neurological function after spinal injury suggest that naloxone's actions, if opiate receptor mediated, may be mediated by non-mu receptors. Dynorphin, an endogenous opioid with a high affinity for the kappa receptor, produced hindlimb paralysis following intrathecal administration in rats.

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.","naproxen","pubmed"

Here, we show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin, the drugs widely used as pain relievers in the clinic, can surmount axon growth restrictions from myelin and proteoglycans by potently inhibiting their downstream pathway RhoA signal. Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma.

Thus, agents which are able to modulate macrophage phenotypes may provide significant benefits to SCI patients. In the present study, we demonstrate that the niacin receptor HCA2 is specifically expressed on the cell surface of M1 but not M2 macrophages. Treatment of M1 macrophages with niacin (300μM) resulted in down-regulation of the p65 NF-κB phosphorylation, associated with a marked decrease in the levels of M1 markers, including CD86, IL-12, and IL-6, and a significant increase in the expressions of M2 markers, such as CD206, IL-10, and IL-13, suggesting that niacin causes a shift of M1 to M2. Moreover, treatment of the M1-oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) co-cultures with niacin markedly promoted the expression of myelin binding protein (MBP). After SCI in C57/BL6 mice for a week, a marked accumulation of M1 macrophages, which expressed HCA2 receptor, was evident in the wound. Treatment of the SCI mice with niacin (100mg/kg) resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of M1 macrophages and a significant increase in the number of M2 macrophages in the wound. This was associated with a robust inflammation resolution, attenuation of demyelination and neurofilament loss, and significant improvement of locomotor function. Thus, HCA2 receptor may serve as a therapeutic target to promote post-SCI recovery.","niacin","pubmed"

Evidence indicates that nicotine can induce potent neuroprotective effects against injury to spinal cord neurons. Therefore, the present study was focused on the effects of nicotine on the behavioral and morphological recovery associated with SCI. Adult male Long-Evans rats were subjected to a moderate contusion model of SCI and received subcutaneous injections of nicotine for 14 days at the dose of 0.35 or 7 mg/kg/day. The rats were examined using the BBB locomotor rating scale for 6 weeks. At the end of the BBB recording, spinal cords were examined for the volumetric tissue sparing of gray and white matters. All SCI rats demonstrated a loss of hindlimb function followed by a recovery phase that peaked at 2-3 weeks after the trauma. Compared to untreated SCI rats, chronic nicotine administration appeared to improve the recovery of the locomotor functions. Indeed, nicotine-treated animals scored consistently higher on the BBB scale indicating that the treatment altered animal behavior. However, when taking under consideration correction factors for multiple comparisons, these data did not reach significance at overall experimental levels of significance 0.05. Nevertheless, nicotine administration was effective in sparing tissue at injury epicenter and a lower dose of nicotine also resulted in significant sparing of white matter of the injured spinal cord. These results suggest that agonists of neuronal nicotinic receptors can be attractive candidates for SCI therapy.","nicotine","pubmed"

Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined.","nitroprusside","pubmed"

The aim of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) after contusive SCI and to investigate whether this protein plays a role in n-3 PUFA-mediated functional recovery post-SCI. We found that SCI resulted in a robust spinal cord up-regulation in FABP5 mRNA levels (556 ± 187%) and protein expression (518 ± 195%), when compared to sham-operated rats, at 7 days post-injury (dpi). This upregulation coincided with significant alterations in the metabolism of fatty acids in the injured spinal cord, as revealed by metabolomics-based lipid analyses. In particular, we found increased levels of the n-3 series PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) at 7 dpi. Animals consuming a diet rich in DHA and EPA exhibited a significant upregulation in FABP5 mRNA levels at 7 dpi. Immunofluorescence showed low basal FABP5 immunoreactivity in spinal cord ventral gray matter NeuN(+) neurons of sham-operated rats. SCI resulted in a robust induction of FABP5 in glial (GFAP(+), APC(+), and NG2(+)) and precursor cells (DCX(+), nestin(+)). We found that continuous intrathecal administration of FABP5 silencing with small interfering RNA (2 μg) impaired spontaneous open-field locomotion post-SCI. Further, FABP5 siRNA administration hindered the beneficial effects of DHA to ameliorate functional recovery at 7 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggest that FABP5 may be an important player in the promotion of cellular uptake, transport, and/or metabolism of DHA post-SCI. Given the beneficial roles of n-3 PUFAs in ameliorating functional recovery, we propose that FABP5 is an important contributor to basic repair mechanisms in the injured spinal cord.","omega3","pubmed"

We found robust sprouting of uninjured corticospinal and serotonergic fibers in a rat cervical hemisection SCI model. A mouse pyramidotomy model was used to confirm that this robust sprouting was not species or injury model specific. Furthermore, we demonstrated that corticospinal fibers sprouting to the denervated side of the cord following pyramidotomy contact V2a interneurons. We also demonstrated increased serotonin fibers and synaptophysin in direct contact with motor neurons. DHA also increased synaptophysin in rat cortical cell cultures. A reduction in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been shown to be involved in axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity. We showed that DHA significantly upregulates miR-21 and downregulates PTEN in corticospinal neurons. Downregulation of PTEN and upregulation of phosphorylated AKT by DHA were also seen in primary cortical neuron cultures and were accompanied by increased neurite outgrowth. In summary, acute DHA induces anatomical and synaptic plasticity in adult injured spinal cord. This study shows that DHA has therapeutic potential in cervical SCI and provides evidence that DHA could exert its beneficial effects in SCI via enhancement of neuroplasticity. In this study, we show that an acute intravenous injection of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 30 min after spinal cord injury induces neuroplasticity. We found robust sprouting of uninjured corticospinal and serotonergic fibers in a rat hemisection spinal cord injury model. A mouse pyramidotomy model was used to confirm that the robust sprouting involved V2a interneurons. We show that DHA significantly upregulates miR-21 and phosphorylated AKT, and downregulates phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is involved in suppressing anatomical plasticity, in corticospinal neurons and in primary cortical neuron cultures. We conclude that acute DHA can induce anatomical and synaptic plasticity. This provides direct evidence that DHA could exert its beneficial effects in spinal cord injury via neuroplasticity enhancement.","omega3","pubmed"

The long chain ω-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have significant biological effects. In particular, DHA is a major component of cell membranes in the brain. It is also involved in neurotransmission. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly devastating pathology that can lead to catastrophic dysfunction, with a significant reduction in the quality of life. Previous studies have shown that EPA and DHA can exert neuroprotective effects in SCI in mice and rats. The aim of this study was to analyze the mechanism of action of ω-3 PUFAs, such as DHA, in a mouse model of SCI, with a focus on the early pathophysiological processes. In this study, SCI was induced in mice by the application of an aneurysm clip onto the dura mater via a four-level T5 to T8 laminectomy. Thirty minutes after compression, animals received a tail vein injection of DHA at a dose of 250 nmol/kg. All animals were killed at 24 h after SCI, to evaluate various parameters implicated in the spread of the injury. Our results in this in-vivo study clearly demonstrate that DHA treatment reduces key factors associated with spinal cord trauma. Treatment with DHA significantly reduced: (1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, (2) pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α), (3) nitrotyrosine formation, (4) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and (5) apoptosis (Fas-L, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, DHA significantly improved the recovery of limb function.Furthermore, in this study we evaluated the effect of oxidative stress on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells using a well-characterized in-vitro model. Treatment with DHA ameliorated the effects of oxidative stress on neurite length and branching. Our results, in vivo and in vitro, clearly demonstrate that DHA treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma.","omega3","pubmed"

Preventive administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or the consumption of a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PUFAs) confers potent prophylaxis against SCI and improves functional recovery. The present study examines whether this novel dietary strategy provides significant antinociceptive benefits in rats experiencing SCI-induced pain. Rats were fed control chow or chow enriched with O3PUFAs for 8weeks before being subjected to sham or cord contusion surgeries, continuing the same diets after surgery for another 8 more weeks. The paw sensitivity to noxious heat was quantified for at least 8weeks post-SCI using the Hargreaves test. We found that SCI rats consuming the preventive O3PUFA-enriched diet exhibited a significant reduction in thermal hyperalgesia compared to those consuming the normal diet. Functional neurometabolomic profiling revealed a distinctive deregulation in the metabolism of endocannabinoids (eCB) and related N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) at 8weeks post-SCI. We found that O3PUFAs consumption led to a robust accumulation of novel NAE precursors, including the glycerophospho-containing docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (DPEA), and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The tissue levels of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the antihyperalgesic phenotype. In addition, rats consuming the O3PUFA-rich diet showed reduced sprouting of nociceptive fibers containing CGRP and dorsal horn neuron p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, well-established biomarkers of pain. The spinal cord levels of inositols were positively correlated with thermal hyperalgesia, supporting their role as biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain. Notably, the O3PUFA-rich dietary intervention reduced the levels of these metabolites. Collectively, these results demonstrate the prophylactic value of dietary O3PUFA against SCI-mediated chronic pain.","omega3","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury, which mainly affects young adults, leads to devastating consequences for the afflicted person with very few treatment options available. In addition to the initial neuronal and glial cell loss, secondary injuries such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation magnify the initial damage. Current strategies involve surgical stabilization and decompression and post-injury rehabilitation but these result in only limited improvements. Therefore, there is still a need for pharmacological interventions to limit the secondary injury processes and improve functional recovery. Research in the past decade has implicated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as a neuroprotective agent capable of limiting post-injury excitotoxic events.

Rats were fed with either control chow or chow enriched with ω-3 PUFAs (750 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks before being subjected to a sham or a contusion SCI operation. We report new evidence showing that rats subjected to SCI after being pre-treated with a diet enriched with ω-3 PUFAs exhibit significantly better functional outcomes. Pre-treated animals exhibited lower sensory deficits, autonomic bladder recovery, and early improvements in locomotion that persisted for at least 8 weeks after trauma. We found that SCI triggers a robust alteration in the cord PUFA neurolipidome, which was characterized by a marked docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency. This DHA deficiency was associated with dysfunction and corrected with the ω-3 PUFA-enriched diet. Multivariate data analyses revealed that the spinal cord of animals consuming the ω-3 PUFA-enriched diet had a fundamentally distinct neurolipidome, particularly increasing the levels of essential and long chain ω-3 fatty acids and lysolipids at the expense of ω-6 fatty acids and its metabolites.

We addressed the question whether the neuroprotective effect of these compounds after spinal cord injury could also be seen when their level is raised in tissues prophylactically, prior to injury. In this study we used transgenic fat-1 mice to examine whether enriching spinal cord tissue in endogenous omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has an effect on the outcome after compression spinal cord injury. The results demonstrate that after thoracic compression spinal cord injury, fat-1 mice display better locomotor recovery compared with the wild-type mice on a high omega-6 diet (high omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in tissues), and wild-type mice on a normal diet (controls). This is associated with a significant increase in neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival and a decrease in non-phosphorylated neurofilament loss. The protection from spinal cord injury in fat-1 mice was also correlated with a reduction in microglia/macrophage activation and in pro-inflammatory mediators. In vitro experiments in dorsal root ganglia primary sensory neurons further demonstrated that a fat-1 tissue background confers robust neuroprotection against a combined mechanical stretch and hypoxic injury. In conclusion, our studies support the hypothesis that a raised omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid level and an altered tissue omega-6/omega-3 ratio prior to injury leads to a much improved outcome after spinal cord injury.","omega3","pubmed"

Compression SCI in C57BL/6 mice was produced by placing a 10 g weight for 5 min onto a 2 mm × 1.5 mm platform applied to the dura at vertebral level T12. Mice partly recovered from complete hindlimb paralysis and by 28 days post-surgery had plateaued at an average BMS locomotor score of 4.2, equivalent to weight support with plantar stepping. During the same period, neuronal loss at the epicentre increased from 26% of ventral horn neurons by day 1, to 68% by day 28. Delayed loss of oligodendrocytes was also seen (e.g. 84% by day 28 in the dorsal columns) and microglia/macrophage activation was maximal at 7 days.

In the early metabolic phase, neuronal signaling, stress, and inflammation-associated metabolites were strongly altered. A dynamic inflammatory response consisting of elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 and palmitoyl ethanolamide as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed. N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) were significantly decreased possibly reflecting neuronal cell death. A second metabolic phase was also seen, consistent with membrane remodeling and antioxidant defense response. These metabolomic changes were consistent with the pathology and progression of SCI. Several metabolites, including NAA, NAAG, and the ω-3 fatty acids docosapentaenoate and docosahexaenoate correlated greatly with the established Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotive score (BBB score).

Therefore, we examined the effect of DAEE treatment on a rat model of spinal cord injury. DAEE (150 μg/kg body weight) administered after hemisection of the spinal cord resulted in improved functional recovery, decreased the lesion size, increased the activation of ERK1/2, and enhanced the expression of bcl-2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the injury site of the spinal cord.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in the onset and resolution of inflammation. Arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 PUFA, contributes to the initiation of inflammatory responses, whereas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 PUFA, has antiinflammatory effects. Therefore, decreasing AA and increasing DHA levels after SCI might be expected to attenuate inflammation after SCI and promote tissue protection and functional recovery. We show here that daily oral administration of fenretinide after spinal cord contusion injury led to a significant decrease in AA and an increase in DHA levels in plasma and injured spinal cord tissue. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in tissue damage and improvement in locomotor recovery. Fenretinide also reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes and the levels of oxidative stress markers after SCI. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated that fenretinide reduced TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) expression by reactive microglia. These results demonstrate that fenretinide treatment after SCI can reduce inflammation and tissue damage in the spinal cord and improve locomotor recovery. These beneficial effects may be mediated via the ability of fenretinide to modulate PUFA homeostasis. Since fenretinide is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers, this drug might be a good candidate for the treatment of acute SCI in humans.","omega3","pubmed"

We review here our recent studies, which suggest that omega-3 PUFA have significant neuroprotective potential in spinal cord trauma. In a first study, we administered an intravenous bolus of alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 30 min after spinal cord hemisection injury in adult rats. The omega-3 PUFA led to increased neuronal and glial survival, and a significantly improved neurological outcome. In subsequent studies, we tested DHA in a more severe compression model of SCI. We also explored a combined acute and chronic treatment regime using DHA. Saline or DHA was administered intravenously 30 min after compression of the spinal cord. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet for 6 weeks following injury. We assessed locomotor recovery and analysed markers for cell survival and axonal damage, and we also investigated the effects of the treatment on the inflammatory reaction and the oxidative stress that follow SCI. We showed that the acute DHA treatment is neuroprotective after compression SCI, even if the treatment is delayed up to an hour after injury. The DHA injection led to an increased neuronal and glial cell survival, and the effect of the DHA injection was amplified by addition of DHA to the diet. Rats treated with a DHA injection and a DHA-enriched diet performed significantly better at 6 weeks in terms of neurological outcome. The analysis of the tissue after DHA administration showed that the fatty acid significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and RNA/DNA oxidation, and the induction of COX-2. Parallel studies in a facial nerve injury model in mice also showed pro-regenerative effects of chronic dietary administration of DHA after nerve lesion. These observations suggest that treatment with omega-3 PUFA could represent a promising therapeutic approach in the management of neurological injury.","omega3","pubmed"

We have therefore carried out a detailed analysis of the effects of DHA in adult rats subject to thoracic compression SCI. Saline or DHA (250 nmol/kg) was administered intravenously (i.v.) 30 min after compression. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet for 1 or 6 weeks, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet (400 mg/kg/day) for 1 or 6 weeks. Other groups received a DHA-enriched diet only for 1 week following injury, or received acute DHA (250 nmol/kg; i.v.) treatment delayed up to 3 h after injury. We also assessed oxidative stress and the inflammatory reaction at the injury site, neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival and axonal damage and the locomotor recovery. At 24 h, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, RNA/DNA oxidation and the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 were all significantly reduced by i.v. DHA administration. At 1 week and 6 weeks, macrophage recruitment was reduced and neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival was substantially increased. Axonal injury was reduced at 6 weeks. Locomotor recovery was improved from day 4, and sustained up to 6 weeks. Rats treated with a DHA-enriched diet in addition to the acute DHA injection were not significantly different from the acute DHA-treated animals at 1 week, but at 6 weeks showed additional improvements in both functional and histological outcomes. DHA treatment was ineffective if the acute injection was delayed until 3 h post-injury, or if the DHA was administered for 1 week solely by diet. Our results in a clinically relevant model of SCI show that significant neuroprotection can be obtained by combining an initial acute i.v. injection of DHA with a sustained dietary supplementation. Given that the safety and tolerability of preparations enriched in omega-3 fatty acids is already well-documented, such a combined DHA treatment regime deserves consideration as a very promising approach to SCI management.","omega3","pubmed"

Ileovesicostomy can be safely performed in neurologically impaired women and men. Severe preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary. In addition, in cases of neural recovery, the ileal ""chimney"" can be excised and the patient's original lower urinary tract would be preserved.","oxybutynin","pubmed"

This is the first study to show how two commonly used anesthetics affect continuously recorded hemodynamic parameters and locomotor recovery during a 2-week period after two levels of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We hypothesized that the level of cardiovascular depression and recovery of locomotor function would be dependent upon the anesthetic used during SCI. Thirty-two adult female rats were subjected to a sham, 25-mm or 50-mm SCI at T3-4 under pentobarbital or isoflurane anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were telemetrically recorded before, during, and after SCI. Locomotor function recovered best in the 25-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. There was no significant difference in locomotor recovery between the 25-mm-injured pentobarbital-anesthetized animals and the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. White matter sparing and extent of intermediolateral cell column loss appeared larger in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, but this was not significant. There were no differential effects of anesthetics on HR and MAP before SCI, but recovery from anesthesia was significantly slower in pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. At the time of SCI, MAP was acutely elevated in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, whereas MAP decreased in the isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Hypotension occurred in the pentobarbital-anesthetized groups and in the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized group. In pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, SCI resulted in acute elevation of HR, although HR remained low. Return of HR to baseline was much slower in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. Severe SCI at T3 produced significant chronic tachycardia that was injury severity dependent. Although some laboratories monitor blood pressure, HR, and other physiological variables during surgery for SCI, inherently few have monitored cardiovascular function during recovery. This study shows that anesthetics affect hemodynamic parameters differently, which in turn can affect functional outcome measures. This supports the need for a careful evaluation of cardiovascular and other physiological measures in experimental models of SCI. Choice of anesthetic should be an important consideration in experimental designs and data analyses.","pentobarbital","pubmed"

The spinal cord injury was cooled with a custom cooling well used over the epidural surface. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) motor scores and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potential (tcMMEP) responses were used after injury to accurately evaluate neurologic recovery. This study was undertaken to determine whether the prognosis for neurologic recovery in a standardized rat spinal cord injury model is altered by the direct application of precisely controlled hypothermia to the area of injury. The role of hypothermia in the treatment of spinal cord injuries with neurologic deficits remains undefined. Hypothermia may decrease an area of spinal cord injury and limit secondary damage, therefore improving neurologic recovery. However, it has been difficult to consistently apply localized cooling to an area of spinal cord injury, and the use of systemic hypothermia is fraught with complications. This fact, along with the unavailability of a precise spinal cord injury model, has resulted in inconsistent results, both clinically and in the laboratory. In a rat model of spinal cord injury, 37 C and 19 C temperatures were used to study the role of hypothermia on neurologic recovery. Male Spraque-Dawley rats (n = 52; weight, 277.7 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to laminectomy at T10. The rats were divided into three groups: 1) placement of a 50% spacer in the epidural space (16 rats), 2) severe (25 g/cm) spinal cord injury (16 rats), 3) 50% spacer in combination with spinal cord injury (16 rats). Eight rats in each group were tested at two temperatures: normothermic (37 C) and hypothermic (19 C). With the use of a specially designed hypothermic pool placed directly over the spinal cord for 2 hours, epidural heating to 37 C, and epidural cooling to 19 C was accomplished. Simultaneous measurements of spinal cord and body temperatures were performed. The rats underwent behavior testing using the BBB motor scores and serial tcMMEPs for 5 weeks. Statistical methods consisted of Student's t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey post hoc t tests and chi2 tests. There was a significant improvement in motor scores in rats subjected to hypothermia compared with those that were normothermic after insertion of a 50% spacer. This improvement was observed during the 5-week duration of follow-up. In the severe spinal cord injury group and the spinal cord injury-spacer groups, no significant improvement in motor scores were obtained when the spinal cord was exposed to hypothermia. The results demonstrate that there is a statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvement in neurologic function in rats subjected to hypothermia (19 C) after insertion of a spacer that induced an ischemic spinal cord injury. This indicates that directly applied hypothermia may be beneficial in preventing injury secondary to ischemic cellular damage. The data demonstrated minimal therapeutic benefit of hypothermia (19 C) after a severe spinal cord injury.","pentobarbital","pubmed"

Control animals subjected to injuries of a magnitude of 400 or 500 gm-cm occasionally demonstrated spontaneous return of translesion SCEP within 2 hours of injury when maintained by pentobarbital anesthesia and by ventilation with ambient room air at 1 atmosphere absolute pressure (1 ATA). Animals sustaining corresponding injuries but receiving immediate treatment with HBO at 2 ATA for a period of 3 hours following impact demonstrated variable responses to this treatment modality. Animals sustaining injuries of 400 gm-cm magnitude showed recovery of translesion SCEP in four of five cases, while animals sustaining injuries of 500 gm-cm magnitude responded to HBO treatment by recovery of SCEP no more frequently than did control animals. When the onset of HBO therapy was delayed by 2 hours following impact, there appeared to be no demonstrable protective effect on long-tract neuronal conduction mediated by HBO alone. The observations suggest that HBO treatments can mediate preservation of marginally injured neuronal elements of the spinal cord long tracts during the early phases of traumatic spinal cord injury. These protective effects may be based upon the reversal of focal tissue hypoxia, or by reduction of tissue edema. HBO treatment markedly diminished the protective effects of HBO on long-tract neuronal conduction following traumatic spinal cord injury.","pentobarbital","pubmed"

Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and injured by placing a 190-gm weight on the spinal cord for 5 minutes. Biochemical analysis of the injured segment revealed a significant depletion in the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (P-creatine), and total adenylates for the entire 24-hour recovery period. Glucose levels initially declined, but by 1 hour had normalized, and at 8 and 24 hours were significantly supranormal. The lactate/pyruvate ratio and tissue lactate concentrations increased four and five and half times, respectively, for the first 4 hours after injury. Between 8 and 24 hours, lactate levels remained elevated, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio declined to contol levels as the result of a significant rise in the tissue pyruvate concentration. This sequence of metabolic changes suggested that metabolism was probably not homogeneous throughout the injured segment, and that tissue metabolic rate was depressed for the initial 4 hours after trauma then increased in metabolically active tissue for the remainder of the 24-hour recovery period. This model of spinal cord trauma results in a severe, prolonged ischemia and metabolic injury to the affected tissue. Whether these metabolic changes results from or cause the tissue damage and irreversible paraplegia associated with this type of spinal cord injury remains to be determined.","pentobarbital","pubmed"

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects. The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort).

Improving neurological recovery by reducing secondary injury is a major principle in the management of SCI. To minimize secondary injury, blood pressure (BP) augmentation has been advocated. The objective of this study was to review the evidence behind BP management after SCI. METHODS This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Using the PubMed database, the authors identified studies that investigated BP management after acute SCI. Information on BP goals, duration of BP management, vasopressor selection, and neurological outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Eleven studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. Nine studies were retrospective, and 2 were single-cohort prospective investigations. Of the 9 retrospective studies, 7 reported a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of higher than 85 mm Hg. For the 2 prospective studies, the MAP goals were higher than 85 mm Hg and higher than 90 mm Hg. The duration of BP management varied from more than 24 hours to 7 days in 6 of the retrospective studies that reported the duration of treatment. In both prospective studies, the duration of treatment was 7 days. In the 2 prospective studies, neurological outcomes were stable to improved with BP management. The retrospective studies, however, were contradictory with regard to the correlation of BP management and outcomes. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were the agents that were frequently used to augment BP. However, more complications have been associated with dopamine use than with the other vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS There are no high-quality data regarding optimal BP goals and duration in the management of acute SCI. Based on the highest level of evidence available from the 2 prospective studies, MAP goals of 85-90 mm Hg for a duration of 5-7 days should be considered. Norepinephrine for cervical and upper thoracic injuries and phenylephrine or norepinephrine for mid- to lower thoracic injuries should be considered.","phenylephrine","pubmed"

In our patient population, only 1 patient with penetrating SCI (7.1%) experienced neurological recovery, as determined by improvement in the American Spinal Injury Association grade, despite the administration of vasopressors for supraphysiological MAP goals for an average of 101.07 ± 34.96 hours. Furthermore, 71.43% of patients with penetrating SCI treated with vasopressors experienced associated cardiogenic complications. Given the decreased likelihood of neurological improvement in penetrating injuries, it may be important to re-examine intervention strategies in this population.

We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 131 patients with SCI who received any kind of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure in the neurocritical care unit of a Level 1 trauma center (2005-2011). Vasopressor usage and complications were obtained from the medical record. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the American Spinal Injury Association score. Dopamine was the most commonly used vasopressor (48.0%), followed by phenylephrine (45.0%), norepinephrine (5.0%), epinephrine (1.5%), and vasopressin (0.5%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complications (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, troponin elevation, atrial fibrillation, heart rate >130 or <50, etc.) due to vasopressors were independently associated with the overall usages of dopamine (odds ratio [OR] 8.97; p<0.001) and phenylephrine (OR, 5.92; p=0.004), age ≥60 years old (OR, 5.16; p=0.013), and complete SCI (OR, 3.23; p=0.028). There was no difference in neurological improvement with either dopamine (OR, 1.16; p=0.788) or phenylephrine (OR 0.96; p=0.940). Incomplete SCI (OR, 2.64; p=0.019) and surgery <24 h after SCI (OR, 4.25; p=0.025) were independently associated with improved outcome.

Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined.","phenylephrine","pubmed"

Experimental animal study. International Collaboration On Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, Canada. Complete transection of the T3 spinal cord was performed in male Wistar rats. For 14 days after injury, AD was induced via colorectal distension (CRD; 30 minutes per day) in the experimental group (SCI-CRD). One month after SCI, baseline cardiovascular parameters and severity of CRD-induced AD were assessed in SCI-CRD animals and SCI-only controls. Mesenteric arteries were harvested for in vitro myography to characterize vasoactive responses to phenylephrine (PE) and acetylcholine (ACh). Mesenteric arteries from SCI-CRD animals exhibited larger maximal responses to PE than arteries from SCI-only controls. Hyperresponsiveness to PE was not a product of endothelial dysfunction because mesenteric arteries from both groups had similar vasodilator responses to ACh. Both SCI-only controls and SCI-CRD animals exhibited CRD-evoked AD 1 month after SCI; however, CRD-induced hypertension was less pronounced in animals that were previously exposed to CRD. Injury-induced changes within the vasculature may contribute to the development of AD after SCI. Here, we provide evidence that AD itself has significant and long-lasting effects on vascular function. This finding has implications for the medical management of AD and provides an impetus for maintaining stable blood pressure.","phenylephrine","pubmed"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of high blood pressure during spinal cord reperfusion on postoperative neurologic outcomes after aortic surgery in rabbits. Experiments were performed using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion model in 2 randomly divided groups: (1) In the HR group, the mean blood pressure was maintained at a high level (121 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) during reperfusion with intravenously administered phenylephrine; and (2) in the CR group, the mean blood pressure was not medically controlled (75 +/- 9.1 mm Hg) during reperfusion. Neurologic and histologic assessments and evaluation of early reperfusion injury were performed. In the HR group, slow and incomplete recovery of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (P = .02) and low neurologic scores (P < .005) were observed during spinal cord reperfusion compared with the CR group. At 48 hours of reperfusion, there were significantly fewer viable neuron cells, more apoptosis, and more perivascular edema with gray matter vacuolation in the HR group (P < .001 for each). At 3 hours, myeloperoxidase activity (P = .0021), vascular permeability (P = .0012), and superoxide generation (P < .0001) were significantly increased in the HR group. Excessively high blood pressure in the early phase of spinal cord reperfusion increased reperfusion injury in the spinal cord, leading to exacerbation of early-onset paraplegia. Avoidance of spinal cord reperfusion with high blood pressure may be one management strategy in thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.","phenylephrine","pubmed"

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects. The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes.","phenytoin","pubmed"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Influx of Na(+) ions into cells has been postulated to be a key early event in the pathogenesis of secondary traumatic and ischemic central nervous system injury. Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole--after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), phenytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p<0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na(+) blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin.","phenytoin","pubmed"

Control and laminectomy-only groups were not injured. 50 g-cm weight drop injury was produced in the trauma group. In the treatment groups, methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) and phenytoin (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally immediately after injury. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the spinal cord samples were examined for lipid peroxidation. Spinal cord ultrastructure was evaluated and grading system was used for quantitative evaluation. Trauma increased tissue MDA levels. Treatment with methylprednisolone and phenytoin decreased MDA levels compared to trauma in all doses. Significant ultrastructural neuroprotection was observed with 30 mg/kg of phenytoin treatment according to general neural score. This ultrastructural neuroprotection of phenytoin was not different from methylprednisolone. Phenytoin appears to protect spinal cord against injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation and lessening neuronal damage associated with SCI in rats.","phenytoin","pubmed"

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 contusion SCI after being fed normal chow or chow containing phenytoin; serum levels of phenytoin were within therapeutic range at the time of injury. At various timepoints after injury, quantitative assessment of lesion volumes, axonal degeneration, axonal conduction, and functional locomotor recovery were performed.

The gene transfection assay and luciferase reporter assay confirmed the target relationship between miR-135a-5p and its target genes (specificity protein 1 [SP1] and Rho-associated kinase [ROCK]1/2). By establishing the H2O2-induced injury model, miR-135a-5p transfection was found to inhibit the apoptosis of PC12 cells by downregulating the SP1 gene, which subsequently induced downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3) and upregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. By measuring the neurite lengths of PC12 cells, miR-135a-5p transfection was found to promote axon outgrowth by downregulating the ROCK1/2 gene, which subsequently caused upregulation of phosphate protein kinase B (AKT) and phosphate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Use of the rat SCI models showed that miR-135a-5p could increase the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores, indicating neurological function recovery. In conclusion, the miR-135a-5p-SP1-Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 and miR-135a-5p-ROCK-AKT/GSK3β axes are involved in functional recovery of SCI by regulating neural apoptosis and axon regeneration, respectively, and thus can be promising effective therapeutic strategies in SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

The authors tested a new treatment targeting removal of CNS glutamate into the blood circulation by injection of the blood glutamate scavengers (BGSs) recombinant enzyme glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (rGOT1) and its cosubstrate oxaloacetic acid (OxAc). Their primary objective was to investigate whether BGS treatment, followed by treadmill exercises in mice with SCI, could attenuate excitotoxicity, inflammation, scarring, and axonal degeneration and, at a later time point, improve functional recovery. A pharmacokinetic experiment was done in C57BL/6 naive mice to verify rGOT1/OxAc blood activity and to characterize the time curve of glutamate reduction in the blood up to 24 hours. The reduction of glutamate in CSF after BGS administration in mice with SCI was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Next, SCI (left hemisection) was induced in the mice, and the mice were randomly assigned to one of the following groups at 1 hour postinjury: control (underwent SCI and received PBS), treadmill exercises, rGOT1/OxAc treatment, or rGOT1/OxAc treatment followed by treadmill exercises. Treatment started 1 hour postinjury with an injection of rGOT1/OxAc and continued for 5 consecutive days. Starting 1 week after SCI, the exercises and the combined treatment groups recommenced the treadmill exercise regimen 5 days a week for 3 months. Locomotor function was assessed for 3 months using the horizontal grid walking test and CatWalk. Axonal anterograde and wallerian degenerations were evaluated using tetramethylrhodamine dextran. Tissue sections were immunofluorescently stained for Iba1, GFAP, GAP-43, synaptophysin, and NeuN. BGS treatment decreased the CSF glutamate level up to 50%, reduced axonal wallerian degeneration, and increased axonal survival and GAP-43 expression in neuronal cells. Combined treatment reduced inflammation, scarring, and lesion size. Additionally, the combination of BGS treatment and exercises increased synapses around motor neurons and enhanced axonal regeneration through the lesion site. This resulted in motor function improvement 3 months post-SCI. As shown by biochemical, immunohistochemical, and functional analysis, BGSs exhibit a substantial neuroprotective effect by reducing excitotoxicity and secondary damage after SCI. Furthermore, in combination with exercises, they reduced axonal degeneration and scarring and resulted in improved functional recovery.","phosphate","pubmed"

Female rats with SCI induced by 1-min clip compression were administered vehicle or 1.5 mg/kg of FTY720 24 h after the injury. Using the mechanical nociceptive threshold test, we monitored neuropathic pain and performed histological analysis of the pain pathway, including the μ opioid receptor (MOR), hydroxytryptamine transporter (HTT), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Motor score, SCI lesion volume, residual motor axons, inflammatory response, glial scar, and microvascular endothelial dysfunction were also compared between the two groups. FTY720 treatment resulted in significant attenuation of post-traumatic neuropathic pain. It also decreased systemic and local inflammation, thereby reducing the damaged areas and astrogliosis and resulting in motor functional recovery. Whereas there was no difference in the CGRP expression between the two groups, FTY720 significantly preserved the MOR in both the caudal and rostral areas of the spinal dorsal horn. Whereas HTT was preserved in the FTY720 group, it was significantly increased in the rostral side and decreased in the caudal side of the injury in the vehicle group. These results suggest that FTY720 ameliorates post-traumatic allodynia through regulation of neuroinflammation, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and inhibition of glial scar formation, thereby preserving the connectivity of the descending inhibitory pathway and reducing neuropathic pain.","phosphate","pubmed"

The combination of a scaffold with cells has been developed with a tendency for achieving greater survival and integration with the host tissue. We investigated the effect of Matrigel combined with neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro and in vivo.

Finally, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Matrigel alone, or Matrigel seeded with NSCs was injected into 48 subacute, clinically relevant rat models of SCI (16 rats per group). Matrigel supported cell survival and differentiation efficiently in vitro and in vivo. SCI rats transplanted with NSCs in Matrigel showed improved behavioral recovery and neuronal and reactive astrocyte marker expression levels compared to PBS- or Matrigel-transplanted rats. Functional repair and neuronal and reactive astrocyte marker expression was slightly improved in the Matrigel-alone group relative to the PBS group, but not statistically significantly.

Levels of adenovirus IX and Sry mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and used to determine the number of adenovirus and mesenchymal stem cells that were transfected into the spinal cord. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to detect HIF-1 protein levels in the spinal cord. The results showed that: (1) compared with the other groups, the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group exhibited the highest combined behavioral score (P < 0.05), the most recovered tissue, and the greatest number of neurons, as indicated by Pischingert's methylene blue staining. (2) Compared with the PBS group, HIF-1 protein expression was greater in the rhodioloside group (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with the Ad-HIF-MSC group, Sry mRNA levels were higher in the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group (P < 0.05). These results confirm that rhodioloside combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can promote the recovery of spinal cord injury and activate the HIF-1 pathway to promote the survival of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and repair damaged neurons within spinal cord tissue. This experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China (approval No. 2015KYLL029) in June 2015.","phosphate","pubmed"

Pharmacological induction of HSPs has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal loss and functional deficits in peripheral and central nervous system injuries. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of trehalose on spinal expression of HSP27, HSP70 and caspase-3 genes following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Methods Male rats weighing 250-300 g underwent laminectomy and were divided into four groups including sham, SCI (received SCI), vehicle (received SCI and phosphate buffer saline intrathecally) and trehalose (received 10 mM trehalose intrathecally following SCI). On days 1, 3 and 7 after injury, HSP27, HSP70 and caspase-3 genes transcripts were quantified in spinal cord tissues via a real-time PCR technique. In addition, locomotor function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale. Results SCI induced the expression of HSP27, HSP70 and caspase-3 genes and BBB score at all time points. Trehalose treatment upregulated HSP27, HSP70 genes expression at 1 day after SCI. Interestingly, a significant reduction in the expression of HSP27 and HSP70 genes was observed on days 3 and 7 following trauma compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.01). Caspase-3 gene showed a decrease in expression in the trehalose-treated group at all times. In addition, neurological function revealed an improvement after treatment with trehalose. Conclusion This study suggests that the neuroprotective effect of trehalose is mediated via regulation of HSP27 and HSP70, which are involved in cytoprotection and functional recovery following SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

It was hypothesized that inhibition of Eph signaling promotes cellular and behavioral recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: Lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury was performed on wildtype (WT) and EphA6 knockout (KO) mice. EphA6-Fc, Ephrin-A5-Fc fusion proteins, and sodium orthovanadate were used to alter the signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry and tissue explants revealed cellular changes. Rotarod tests demonstrated vestibulomotor function. Outcomes: The EphA6 receptor expression is upregulated following LFP. Uninjured EphA6 KO mice exhibit greater neurite density and clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc causes growth cone collapse in vitro. After LFP, EphA6 KO mice demonstrate longer neurites and decreased neuronal cell death and astrocytosis compared to WT mice. Blocking EphA signaling by soluble EphA6-Fc fusion protein reduces cell death and improves motor function following LFP whereas clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc exacerbates cell death and neurodegeneration. Sodium orthovanadate rescues growth cone collapse in vitro as well as cell death and neurodegeneration in vivo. Conclusions: Eph/Ephrin signaling plays an inhibitory role following TBI. Targeting the Eph signaling pathway with Fc fusion proteins and pharmacological agents can be a novel strategy to counter the damaging effects of TBI.

Besides vascular growth factors, guidance molecules have been identified to regulate aspects of angiogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) and may provide targets for therapeutic angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of the neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo-A or one of its corresponding receptors, S1PR2, improves vascular sprouting and repair and reduces neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia in mice. These findings were reproduced in a therapeutic approach using intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibodies; such a therapy is currently in clinical testing for spinal cord injury.

The interaction between miR-92b-3p and PTEN was further detected in the PC12 cell line and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Neurite growth proteins (GAP43 and NF-200) were assessed by western blotting after miR-92b-3p mimics treatment. The PTEN/AKT pathway-related proteins and their roles in miR-92b-3p regulation were also identified using western blotting and immunofluorescence in vitro through LY294002, an AKT inhibitor. The effect of miR-92b-3p was further determined in vivo according to the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) Scale and GAP43 and NF-200 expressions. miR-92b-3p was downregulated after ASCI, while PTEN showed a simultaneous opposing trend. Overexpression of miR-92b-3p downregulated PTEN expression and promoted phosphorylation of AKT, as well as the expression of GAP43 and NF-200 in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-92b-3p exerted its effect by targeting PTEN's 3'-untranslated regions and that this effect could be counteracted by AKT phosphorylation blocker LY294002 through western blotting and immunofluorescence. Moreover, miR-92b-3p could also improve the BBB scale as well as GAP43 and NF-200 expression levels in vivo.

Since macrophages are major inflammatory contributors to the acute spinal cord injury, and are the major phagocytic cells, we hypothesized that transplanting Schwann cells after macrophage depletion will improve cell survival and integration with host tissue after SCI. To test this hypothesis, rat models of contusive SCI at thoracic level 8 were randomly subjected to macrophage depletion or not. In rat subjected to macrophage depletion, liposomes filled with clodronate were intraperitoneally injected at 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18 days post injury. Rats not subjected to macrophage depletion were intraperitoneally injected with liposomes filled with phosphate buffered saline. Schwann cells were transplanted 1 week post injury in all rats. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected at thoracic level 5 to evalute axon regeneration. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor test, Gridwalk test, and sensory test using von Frey filaments were performed to assess functional recovery. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament, and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and also to visulize BDA-labelled axons. The GFP labeled Schwann cell and cyst and lesion volumes were quantified using stained slides. The numbers of BDA-positive axons were also quantified. At 8 weeks after Schwann cell transplantation, there was a significant reduction in cyst and lesion volumes in the combined treatment group compared to Schwann cell transplantation alone. These changes were not associated, however, with improved Schwann cell survival, axon growth, or locomotor recovery. Although combining Schwann cell transplantation with macrophage depletion does improve histopathology of the injury site, the effect on axon growth and behavioral recovery appears no better than what can be achieved with Schwann cell transplants alone.","phosphate","pubmed"

However, the problem for using them as biomarkers is the way they should be collected, as acquiring CSF through a lumbar puncture is significantly invasive. Remarkably, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as interesting biomarker candidates because of their stability in biological fluids and their tissue specificity. Several miRNAs have been identified to have their expressions altered in SCI in many animal models, making them promising candidates as biomarkers after SCI. Moreover, there are yet no effective therapies for SCI. It is already known that altered lysophospholipids (LPs) signaling are involved in the biology of disorders, such as inflammation. Reports have demonstrated that LPs when locally distributed can regulate SCI repair and key secondary injury processes such as apoptosis and inflammation, and so could become in the future new therapeutic approaches for treating SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

Male rats (220-250 g) were divided into three groups (n=28) including rats that underwent SCI (SCI group), rats subjected to SCI and received an intrathecal injection of phosphate buffer saline (SCI+PBS group), and rats that underwent SCI and received cABC intrathecally (SCI+E group). Then, the level of TNF-α, Il-1β, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and myeloperoxidase in injured tissues, as well as hindlimb motor function, were measured at 4 hr, 1, 3 and 7 days post-SCI. Our data showed that cABC treatment reduced the development of inflammation and oxidative stress associated with SCI at all-time points. In addition, functional recovery was improved in rats that received cABC at 7 days post-SCI.

However, the drugs targeting this signaling pathway are still lacking. The endocannabinoid system, including its receptors (CB1 and CB2), act as neuroprotective and immunomodulatory modulators in SCI. WIN55212-2, an agonist for CB1 and CB2 receptors, has been demonstrated with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in multiple neurological diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether WIN55212-2 could promote functional recovery after traumatic SCI via inhibition of the GAPDH/Siah1 signaling. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from 25mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. Our results showed that WIN55212-2 alleviated the activation of GAPDH/Siah1 signaling pathway after SCI, as indicated by the reduction in GAPDH nuclear expression, GAPDH-Siah1 complex formation and iNOS protein expression. Furthermore, WIN55212-2 reduced apoptosis, production of IL-1β and TNF-α and activation of NF-κB signaling in the spinal cord after SCI. The behavioral tests showed that WIN55212-2 improved the functional recovery after traumatic SCI as indicated by sustained increase in the locomotor scores. However, these neuroprotective effects of WIN55212-2 were blocked in the presence of the combined treatment of AM630 (an antagonist of CB2) rather than AM251 (an antagonist of CB1).

Four days after intrathecal infusion tubes implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, SCI was induced with an infinite horizon impactor. In the Sham group (n=5), phosphate-buffered saline was injected 3, 7, and 14 days after SCI. GCSF, ADSCs, and ADSCs with GCSF were injected at the same time in the GCSF (n=8), ADSC (n=8), and ADSC+GCSF groups (n=7), respectively.

In the ladder rung test, all four groups were significantly different from each other, with the ADSC+GCSF group showing the best improvement (p<0.01). On immunofluorescent staining (GAP43, MAP2), western blotting (GAP43), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (GAP43, nerve growth factor), the ADSC and ADSC+GCSF groups showed higher levels than the Sham and GCSF groups.

Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale and grid walk tests were then utilized to estimate neurological rehabilitation. Additionally, the following assays were performed: Immunofluorescence localization of BMSCs to the site of SCI; the transwell migration assay to detect in vitro cellular migration; the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay to determine the apoptotic index of the lesion; and western blotting analysis to evaluate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at the site of SCI. The BBB scores of the BMSC + EPO treated group were significantly increased compared with the BMSC treatment group (P<0.05). For example, BMSC + EPO treated rats had a significantly decreased number of hind limb slips compared with the BMSC treatment group (P<0.05). Furthermore, EPO significantly increased the migration capacity of BMSCs compared with the control group (P<0.001). In addition, the apoptotic index of the BMSC + EPO group was significantly decreased compared with the BMSC group (P<0.05). Green fluorescent protein-labeled BMSCs were detected at the site of SCI in the BMSC and BMSCs + EPO groups, with the signal being notably stronger in the latter. Moreover, the expression of VEGF and BDNF in the BMSCs + EPO group was significantly increased compared with the BMSC group (P<0.05).

In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in preliminary clinical trials in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the combined administration of recombinant adenoviral vectors (Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG) encoding the neurotrophic/angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and angiogenin ( ANG) was found to slow the development of neurological deficits. These results suggest that there may be positive effects of this combination of genes in posttraumatic spinal cord regeneration. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG combination therapy on motor function recovery and reactivity of astrocytes in a rat model of SCI. METHODS Spinal cord injury was induced in adult Wistar rats by the weight-drop method. Rats (n = 51) were divided into 2 groups: the experimental group (Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG) and the control group (Ad5-GFP [green fluorescent protein]). Recovery of motor function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. The duration and intensity of infectivity and gene expression from the injected vectors were assessed by immunofluorescent detection of GFP. Reactivity of glial cells was assessed by changes in the number of immunopositive cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100β, aquaporin 4 (AQP4), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4. The level of S100β mRNA expression in the spinal cord was estimated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Partial recovery of motor function was observed 30 days after surgery in both groups. However, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were 35.9% higher in the Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG group compared with the control group. Specific GFP signal was observed at distances of up to 5 mm in the rostral and caudal directions from the points of injection. A 1.5 to 2.0-fold increase in the number of GFAP+, S100β+, and AQP4+ cells was observed in the white and gray matter at a distance of up to 5 mm from the center of the lesion site in the caudal and rostral directions. At 30 days after injury, a 2-fold increase in S100β transcripts was observed in the Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS Intraspinal injection of recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding VEGF and ANG stimulates functional recovery after traumatic SCI. The increased number of S100β+ astrocytes induced by this approach may be a beneficial factor for maintaining the survival and function of neurons. Therefore, gene therapy with Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG vectors is an effective therapeutic method for SCI treatment.","phosphate","pubmed"

METHODS BMSC sheets were prepared from the bone marrow of female Fischer 344 rats using ascorbic acid and were cryopreserved until the day of transplantation. A gelatin sponge (GS), as a control, or BMSC sheet was transplanted into a 2-mm-sized defect of the spinal cord at the T-8 level. Axonal regeneration and glial scar formation were assessed 2 and 8 weeks after transplantation by immunohistochemical analyses using anti-Tuj1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies, respectively.

Previously, we observed that age alters the balance of destructive (M1) and protective (M2) macrophages; however, the age-related pathophysiology in SCI is poorly understood. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) contributes to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage and macrophage activation in neurotrauma. Further, NOX and ROS increase with central nervous system age. Here, we found significantly higher ROS generation in 14 versus 4-month-old (MO) mice after contusion SCI. Notably, NOX2 increased in 14 MO ROS-producing macrophages suggesting that macrophages and NOX contribute to SCI oxidative stress. Indicators of lipid peroxidation, a downstream cytotoxic effect of ROS accumulation, were significantly higher in 14 versus 4 MO SCI mice. We also detected a higher percentage of ROS-producing M2 (Arginase-1-positive) macrophages in 14 versus 4 MO mice, a previously unreported SCI phenotype, and increased M1 (CD16/32-positive) macrophages with age.

The present study investigated whether neurological function following a severe spinal cord injury improves after utilizing either a durotomy to decompress the intradural space and/or a duraplasty to maintain proper flow of cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS Sixty-four adult female rats (n = 64) were randomly assigned to receive either a 3- or 5-level decompressive laminectomy (Groups A and B), laminectomy + durotomy (Groups C and D), or laminectomy + duraplasty with graft (Group E and F) at 24 hours following a severe thoracic contusion injury (200 kilodynes). Duraplasty involved the use of DuraSeal, a hydrogel dural sealant. Uninjured and injured control groups were included (Groups G, H). Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed by open field locomotor testing (BBB) and CatWalk gait analysis at 35 days postinjury. Bladder function was analyzed and bladder wall thickness was assessed histologically. At 35 days postinjury, mechanical and thermal allodynia were assessed by the Von Frey hair filament and hotplate paw withdrawal tests, respectively. Thereafter, the spinal cords were dissected, examined for gross anomalies at the injury site, and harvested for histological analyses to assess lesion volumes and white matter sparing. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS There was no significant improvement in motor function recovery in any treatment groups compared with injured controls. CatWalk gait analysis indicated a significant decrease in interlimb coordination in Groups B, C, and D (p < 0.05) and swing speed in Groups A, B, and D. Increased mechanical pain sensitivity was observed in Groups A, C, and F (p < 0.05). Rats in Group C also developed thermal pain hypersensitivity. Examination of spinal cords demonstrated increased lesion volumes in Groups C and F and increased white matter sparing in Group E (p < 0.05). The return of bladder automaticity was similar in all groups. Examination of the injury site during tissue harvest revealed that, in some instances, expansion of the hydrogel dural sealant caused compression of the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS Surgical decompression provided no benefit in terms of neurological improvement in the setting of a severe thoracic spinal cord contusion injury in rats at 24 hours postinjury. Decompressive laminectomy and durotomy did not improve motor function recovery, and rats in both of these treatment modalities developed neuropathic pain. Performing a durotomy also led to increased lesion volumes. Placement of DuraSeal was shown to cause compression in some rats in the duraplasty treatment groups. Decompressive duraplasty of 3 levels does not affect functional outcomes after injury but did increase white matter sparing. Decompressive duraplasty of 5 levels led to neuropathic pain development and increased lesion volumes. Further comparison of dural repair techniques is necessary.","phosphate","pubmed"

Inhibitory signalling from these domains causes a collapse of the neuronal growth cone via individual receptor complexes, centred around sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) for Nogo-A-Δ20 and Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) for Nogo-66.

We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess potential residual structural propensities of the intrinsically disordered Nogo-A-Δ20. Using triple resonance experiments, we were able to assign 94% of the non-proline backbone residues. While secondary structure analysis and relaxation measurements highlighted the intrinsically disordered character of Nogo-A-Δ20, three stretches comprising residues 561EAIQESL567, 639EAMNVALKALGT650, and 693SNYSEIAK700 form transient α-helical structures.

A previous study by these authors demonstrated that low-energy ESWT promoted expression of VEGF in damaged neural tissue and improved locomotor function after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the neuroprotective mechanisms in the injured spinal cord produced by low-energy ESWT are still unknown. In the present study, the authors investigated the cell specificity of VEGF expression in injured spinal cords and angiogenesis induced by low-energy ESWT. They also examined the neuroprotective effects of low-energy ESWT on cell death, axonal damage, and white matter sparing as well as the therapeutic effect for improvement of sensory function following SCI. METHODS Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the SCI group (SCI only) and SCI-SW group (low-energy ESWT applied after SCI). Thoracic SCI was produced using a New York University Impactor. Low-energy ESWT was applied to the injured spinal cord 3 times a week for 3 weeks after SCI. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan open-field locomotor score for 42 days after SCI. Mechanical and thermal allodynia in the hindpaw were evaluated for 42 days. Double staining for VEGF and various cell-type markers (NeuN, GFAP, and Olig2) was performed at Day 7; TUNEL staining was also performed at Day 7. Immunohistochemical staining for CD31, α-SMA, and 5-HT was performed on spinal cord sections taken 42 days after SCI. Luxol fast blue staining was performed at Day 42. RESULTS Low-energy ESWT significantly improved not only locomotion but also mechanical and thermal allodynia following SCI. In the double staining, expression of VEGF was observed in NeuN-, GFAP-, and Olig2-labeled cells. Low-energy ESWT significantly promoted CD31 and α-SMA expressions in the injured spinal cords. In addition, low-energy ESWT significantly reduced the TUNEL-positive cells in the injured spinal cords. Furthermore, the immunodensity of 5-HT-positive axons was significantly higher in the animals treated by low-energy ESWT. The areas of spared white matter were obviously larger in the SCI-SW group than in the SCI group, as indicated by Luxol fast blue staining. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggested that low-energy ESWT promotes VEGF expression in various neural cells and enhances angiogenesis in damaged neural tissue after SCI.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SCI using a weight drop device and then hAMSCs, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were immediately injected into the contused dorsal spinal cord at 2 mm rostral and 2 mm caudal to the injury site. Our results indicated that transplanted hAMSCs migrated in the host spinal cord without differentiating into neuronal or glial cells. Compared with the control group, hAMSCs transplantation significantly decreased the numbers of ED1+ macrophages/microglia and caspase-3+ cells. In addition, hAMSCs transplantation significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the injured spinal cord, and promoted both angiogenesis and axonal regeneration. These effects were associated with significantly improved neurobehavioral recovery in the hAMSCs transplantation group. These results show that transplantation of hAMSCs provides neuroprotective effects in rats after SCI, and could be candidate stem cells for the treatment of SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

It is associated with a variety of injurious conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for spinal cord injury (SCI). Sivelestat sodium (SIV), a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor initially used to treat acute lung injury, has been known to protect against compression-induced and ischemic SCI. However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling in the spinal cord. The behavioral tests showed that SIV promoted functional recovery after traumatic SCI as reflected in the sustained increase in the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores throughout the observation period. In conclusion, our results reveal GAPDH/Siah1 as a novel signaling pathway during the progression of SCI, which can be blocked by SIV.","phosphate","pubmed"

This study uses peripheral nerve grafts (PNGs) as scaffolds for axonal growth while delivering neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) via calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings on surgical sutures. CaP coating was grown on sutures, and NT-3 binding and release were characterized in vitro. Then, the NT-3-loaded sutures were tested in a complete SCI model. Rats were analyzed for functional improvement and axonal growth into the grafts. The CaP-coated sutures exhibited a burst release of NT-3, followed by a sustained release for at least 20 days. Functionally, the rats with PNGs + NT-3-loaded sutures and the rats treated with PNGs scored significantly higher than controls on day 56 postoperatively. However, functional scores in rats treated with PNGs + NT-3-loaded suture were not significantly different from those of rats treated with PNGs alone. Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) labeling rostral to the graft was not observed in any controls, but CTB labeling rostral to the graft was observed in almost all rats that had had a PNG. Neurofilament labeling on transverse sections of the graft revealed that the rats treated with the NT-3-loaded sutures had significantly more axons per graft than rats treated with an NT-3 injection and rats without NT-3.

Therefore, providing spinal tissue with an alternative energy substrate during ischemia may be neuroprotective after SCI. To assess this, rats received a mild contusive SCI (120 kdyn, Infinite Horizons impactor) at thoracic level 9 (T9), which causes loss of ∼ 80% of the ascending sensory dorsal column axonal projections to the gracile nucleus. Immediately afterwards, the energy substrate acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC; 1 mg/day) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was infused intrathecally (sub-arachnoid) for 6 days via an L5/6 catheter attached to a subcutaneous Alzet pump. ALC treatment improved overground locomotor function (Basso-Beattie-Breshnahan [BBB] score 18 vs. 13) at 6 days, total spared epicenter (71% vs. 57%) and penumbra white matter (90% vs. 85%), ventral penumbra microvessels (108% vs. 79%), and penumbra motor neurons (42% vs. 15%) at 15 days post-SCI, compared with PBS treatment. However, the ascending sensory projections (anterogradely traced with cholera toxin B from the sciatic nerves) and dorsal column white matter and perfused blood vessels were not protected. Furthermore, grid walking, a task we have shown to be dependent on dorsal column function, was not improved. Thus, mitochondrial substrate replacement may only be efficacious in areas of lesser or temporary ischemia, such as the ventral spinal cord and injury penumbra in this study. The current data also support our previous evidence that microvessel loss is central to secondary tissue degeneration.","phosphate","pubmed"

Known interventions that promote neural repair remain limited in their functional efficacy. To understand genetic determinants of mammalian CNS axon regeneration, we completed an unbiased RNAi gene-silencing screen across most phosphatases in the genome. We identified one known and 17 previously unknown phosphatase suppressors of injury-induced CNS axon growth. Silencing Inpp5f (Sac2) leads to robust enhancement of axon regeneration and growth cone reformation. Results from cultured Inpp5f(-/-) neurons confirm lentiviral shRNA results from the screen. Consistent with the nonoverlapping substrate specificity between Inpp5f and PTEN, rapamycin does not block enhanced regeneration in Inpp5f(-/-) neurons, implicating mechanisms independent of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Inpp5f(-/-) mice develop normally, but show enhanced anatomical and functional recovery after mid-thoracic dorsal hemisection injury. More serotonergic axons sprout and/or regenerate caudal to the lesion level, and greater numbers of corticospinal tract axons sprout rostral to the lesion. Functionally, Inpp5f-null mice exhibit enhanced recovery of motor functions in both open-field and rotarod tests. This study demonstrates the potential of an unbiased high-throughput functional screen to identify endogenous suppressors of CNS axon growth after injury, and reveals Inpp5f (Sac2) as a novel suppressor of CNS axon repair after spinal cord injury. Significance statement: The extent of axon regeneration is a critical determinant of neurological recovery from injury, and is extremely limited in the adult mammalian CNS. We describe an unbiased gene-silencing screen that uncovered novel molecules suppressing axonal regeneration. Inpp5f (Sac2) gene deletion promoted recovery from spinal cord injury with no side effects. The mechanism of action is distinct from another lipid phosphatase implicated in regeneration, PTEN. This opens new pathways for investigation in spinal cord injury research. Furthermore the screening methodology can be applied on a genome wide scale to discovery the entire set of mammalian genes contributing to axonal regeneration.","phosphate","pubmed"

Because distinct differences exist in the neuroanatomy and immunological responses between rodents and primates, it is critical to determine the effectiveness and safety of allografted embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NS/PCs (ESC-NS/PCs) in a nonhuman primate SCI model. In the present study, common marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group). In the control group, phosphate-buffered saline was injected instead of cells. In the presence of a low-dose of tacrolimus, several grafted cells survived without tumorigenicity and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Significant differences were found in the transverse areas of luxol fast blue-positive myelin sheaths, neurofilament-positive axons, corticospinal tract fibers, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive vessels at the lesion epicenter between the transplantation and control groups. Immunoelectron microscopic examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control group. In addition, a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay indicated that ESC-NS/PCs modulated the allogeneic immune rejection. Taken together, our results indicate that allogeneic transplantation of ESC-NS/PCs from a nonhuman primate promoted functional recovery after SCI without tumorigenicity. This study demonstrates that allogeneic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) promoted functional recovery after transplantation into the injured spinal cord in nonhuman primates. ESC-NS/PCs were chosen because ESC-NS/PCs are one of the controls for induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NS/PCs and because ESC derivatives are possible candidates for clinical use. This translational research using an allograft model of a nonhuman primate is critical for clinical application of grafting NS/PCs derived from various allogeneic pluripotent stem cells, especially induced pluripotent stem cells, into injured spinal cord at the subacute phase.","phosphate","pubmed"

Recent studies have demonstrated that low-energy ESWT upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and promotes angiogenesis and functional recovery in myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease. Many previous reports suggested that VEGF produces a neuroprotective effect to reduce secondary neural tissue damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether low-energy ESWT promotes VEGF expression and neuroprotection and improves locomotor recovery after SCI. Sixty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group (laminectomy only), sham-SW group (low-energy ESWT applied after laminectomy), SCI group (SCI only), and SCI-SW group (low-energy ESWT applied after SCI). Thoracic spinal cord contusion injury was inflicted using an impactor. Low-energy ESWT was applied to the injured spinal cord 3 times a week for 3 weeks. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) Scale (open field locomotor score) at different time points over 42 days after SCI. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess neural tissue damage in the spinal cord. Neuronal loss was investigated by immunostaining for NeuN. The mRNA expressions of VEGF and its receptor, Flt-1, in the spinal cord were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunostaining for VEGF was performed to evaluate VEGF protein expression in the spinal cord. In both the sham and sham-SW groups, no animals showed locomotor impairment on BBB scoring. Histological analysis of H & E and NeuN stainings in the sham-SW group confirmed that no neural tissue damage was induced by the low-energy ESWT. Importantly, animals in the SCI-SW group demonstrated significantly better locomotor improvement than those in the SCI group at 7, 35, and 42 days after injury (p < 0.05). The number of NeuN-positive cells in the SCI-SW group was significantly higher than that in the SCI group at 42 days after injury (p < 0.05). In addition, mRNA expressions of VEGF and Flt-1 were significantly increased in the SCI-SW group compared with the SCI group at 7 days after injury (p < 0.05). The expression of VEGF protein in the SCI-SW group was significantly higher than that in the SCI group at 7 days (p < 0.01). The present study showed that low-energy ESWT significantly increased expressions of VEGF and Flt-1 in the spinal cord without any detrimental effect. Furthermore, it significantly reduced neuronal loss in damaged neural tissue and improved locomotor function after SCI. These results suggested that low-energy ESWT enhances the neuroprotective effect of VEGF in reducing secondary injury and leads to better locomotor recovery following SCI.

Cell-based gene therapy is becoming a major focus for the treatment of SCI. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a promising stem cell type useful for repairing SCI. However, the effects of BMSCs transplants are likely limited because of low transplant survival after SCI. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a multifunctional growth factor which can facilitate neuronal and BMSCs survival, promote axonal growth, prevent activation of the astrocyte lineage, and enhance the delivery of neurotrophic factors in BMSCs. However, treatment of SCI with Shh alone also has limited effects on recovery, because the protein is cleared quickly. In this study, we investigated the use of BMSCs overexpressing the Shh transgene (Shh-BMSCs) in the treatment of rats with SCI, which could stably secrete Shh and thereby enhance the effects of BMSCs, in an attempt to combine the advantages of Shh and BMSCs and so to promote functional recovery. After Shh-BMSCs treatment of SCI via the subarachnoid, we detected significantly greater damage recovery compared with that seen in rats treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and BMSCs. Use of Shh-BMSCs increased the expression and secretion of Shh, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), improved the behavioral function, enhanced the BMSCs survival, promoted the expression level of neurofilament 200 (NF200), and reduced the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Thus, our results indicated that Shh-BMSCs enhanced recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats and could be a potential valuable therapeutic intervention for SCI in humans.","phosphate","pubmed"

SCI was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing an aneurysm clip extradurally for 60 s at T10. The rats received treatment with either vehicle (SCI control) or chrysin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) for 28 days. The various behavioral, biochemical and molecular parameters were determined. Chronic treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently (P < 0.05) attenuated the decrease in body weight, urine output, footprint analysis, sperm count and organ weight (testis, seminal vesicle and urinary bladder). It significantly improved (P < 0.05) the nociceptive threshold, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity. The decreased activity of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and membrane-bound inorganic phosphate were significantly (P < 0.05) restored by chrysin treatment. SCI resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in lipid peroxidase, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, and bax whereas expression of bcl-2 and caspase-3 were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced. These changes were significantly reduced by treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg, P < 0.05). Histological aberration induced after SCI in spinal cord, testis, kidney and urinary bladder were restored by treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg). In conclusion, chrysin is a potential flavone-possessing antioxidant and its antiapoptotic property caused the subsequent recovery of both motor and sensory functions via modulation of endogenous biomarkers and neuronal apoptosis to inhibit the incidence of neurological deficits due to SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

Despite many previous studies regarding SCI, there is no established treatment in clinical practice. miRNAs have attracted immense attention because of their crucial role in human disease, and they have been proposed as potential new therapeutic targets for SCI. At specific times after administration, mice were analyzed by several methods to examine the distribution of miR-210, histological angiogenesis and neurogenesis, functional recovery from SCI, and the expression levels of target genes of miR-210. After injection of miR-210 into the lesion of the injured spinal cord, expression of endogenous miR-210 increased until 6 days after injection. The administration of miR-210 promoted angiogenesis and astrogliosis, and improved functional recovery after SCI compared with the noninjected controls. Furthermore, the area made up of axons and myelin in the spinal cord tissues caudal to the injury site was larger in mice injected with miR-210 than those of the controls. Apoptotic cell death was lower in mice administered miR-210. After administration of miR-210, the expressions of protein-tyrosine phosphate 1B and ephrin-A3, both gene targets of miR-210, were downregulated at the protein level and protein-tyrosine phosphate 1B expression was also downregulated at the transcriptional level. MiR-210 might contribute to spinal cord repair by promoting angiogenesis via the inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphate 1B and ephrin-A3. N/A.","phosphate","pubmed"

SCI significantly increased cPLA2 expression and activation. Activated cPLA2 was localized mainly in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Notably, the SCI-induced cPLA2 activation was mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. In vitro, activation of cPLA2 by ceramide-1-phosphate or A23187 induced spinal neuronal death, which was substantially reversed by arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone, a cPLA2 inhibitor. Remarkably, blocking cPLA2 pharmacologically at 30 minutes postinjury or genetically deleting cPLA2 in mice ameliorated motor deficits, and reduced cell loss and tissue damage after SCI. cPLA2 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of SCI, at least in the C57BL/6 mouse, and as such could be an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating secondary tissue damage and promoting recovery of function after SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

With the advent of stem cell therapy and its potential to induce nervous tissue regeneration processes, the interest in the use of these cells as a treatment for neurological disorders has increased. Human stem cells, derived from the umbilical cord, are one of the strong candidates used in cell therapy for spinal cord injury because of weak immunogenicity and ready availability. We sought to evaluate the use of human umbilical cord blood stem cells (HUCBSCs) to attenuate the neurological effects of spinal cord ischaemia induced by high thoracic aorta occlusion. Forty Wistar rats were randomized to receive intrathecal injection of 10 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1 × 10(4) HUCBSCs, 30 min before (Tpre group: n = 10) and 30 min after (Tpos group: n = 10) descending thoracic aorta occlusion by intraluminal balloon during 12 min. Control groups received only PBS solution (Cpre group: n = 10; and Cpos group: n = 10). During a 28-day observational period, motor function was assessed by a functional grading scale (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan). Segments of thoracolumbar spinal cord specimens were analysed for histological and immunohistochemical assessment for detection and quantification of human haematopoietic cells (CD45(+)) and apoptosis (transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labelling). Overall mortality was 12 animals (30%). Therefore, the observational sample was composed of 28 animals. All groups showed similar incidence of paraplegia and mortality. The mean motor function scores showed no difference during time between the animals of each group, excepting for the Tpos group, which improved from 8.14 (±8.6) to 14.28 (±9.8) (P < 0.01). A treatment-by-time interaction was detected among animals that received HUCBSCs 30 min after ischaemia, with BBB scores higher from Days 14 to 28 compared with the first observational day with statistical difference (P = 0.01). Number of viable neurons was higher in the Tpos group (P = 0.14) and the incidence of apoptosis was lower in the same animals (P = 0.048), but showed no difference with its respective control. We confirmed the presence of CD45(+) cells 4 weeks after intrathecal injection in both therapeutic groups but mainly in the Tpos group. Intrathecal transplantation of HUCBSCs is feasible, and it improved spinal cord function, when they were delivered 30 min after spinal cord ischaemia, in a model of endovascular descending thoracic aorta occlusion in rats. Human umbilical cord blood is one of the potentially useful sources of stem cells for therapy of spinal cord ischaemia.","phosphate","pubmed"

Preventive administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or the consumption of a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PUFAs) confers potent prophylaxis against SCI and improves functional recovery. The present study examines whether this novel dietary strategy provides significant antinociceptive benefits in rats experiencing SCI-induced pain. Rats were fed control chow or chow enriched with O3PUFAs for 8weeks before being subjected to sham or cord contusion surgeries, continuing the same diets after surgery for another 8 more weeks. The paw sensitivity to noxious heat was quantified for at least 8weeks post-SCI using the Hargreaves test. We found that SCI rats consuming the preventive O3PUFA-enriched diet exhibited a significant reduction in thermal hyperalgesia compared to those consuming the normal diet. Functional neurometabolomic profiling revealed a distinctive deregulation in the metabolism of endocannabinoids (eCB) and related N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) at 8weeks post-SCI. We found that O3PUFAs consumption led to a robust accumulation of novel NAE precursors, including the glycerophospho-containing docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (DPEA), and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The tissue levels of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the antihyperalgesic phenotype. In addition, rats consuming the O3PUFA-rich diet showed reduced sprouting of nociceptive fibers containing CGRP and dorsal horn neuron p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, well-established biomarkers of pain. The spinal cord levels of inositols were positively correlated with thermal hyperalgesia, supporting their role as biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain. Notably, the O3PUFA-rich dietary intervention reduced the levels of these metabolites. Collectively, these results demonstrate the prophylactic value of dietary O3PUFA against SCI-mediated chronic pain.","phosphate","pubmed"

The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal transplantation site of NS/PCs for the treatment of SCI. Wild-type mice were generated with contusive SCI at the T10 level, and NS/PCs were derived from fetal transgenic mice. These NS/PCs ubiquitously expressed ffLuc-cp156 protein (Venus and luciferase fusion protein) and so could be detected by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 9 days postinjury. NS/PCs (low: 250,000 cells per mouse; high: 1 million cells per mouse) were grafted into the spinal cord at the lesion epicenter (E) or at rostral and caudal (RC) sites. Phosphate-buffered saline was injected into E as a control. Motor functional recovery was better in each of the transplantation groups (E-Low, E-High, RC-Low, and RC-High) than in the control group. The photon counts of the grafted NS/PCs were similar in each of the four transplantation groups, suggesting that the survival of NS/PCs was fairly uniform when more than a certain threshold number of cells were transplanted. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that brain-derived neurotropic factor expression was higher in the RC segment than in the E segment, and this may underlie why NS/PCs more readily differentiated into neurons than into astrocytes in the RC group. The location of the transplantation site did not affect the area of spared fibers, angiogenesis, or the expression of any other mediators. These findings indicated that the microenvironments of the E and RC sites are able to support NS/PCs transplanted during the subacute phase of SCI similarly. Optimally, a certain threshold number of NS/PCs should be grafted into the E segment to avoid damaging sites adjacent to the lesion during the injection procedure.","phosphate","pubmed"

In an attempt to further characterize the multiple functions of L1 after severe SCI we analyzed locomotor functions and measured axonal regrowth/sprouting and sparing, glial scarring, and synaptic remodeling at 6 weeks after severe spinal cord compression injury at the T7-9 levels of L1-deficient mice (L1-/y) and their wild-type (L1+/y) littermates, as well as mice that overexpress L1 under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter (L1tg) and their wild-type littermates (L1+/+). No differences were found in the locomotor scale score and single frame motion analysis between L1-/y and L1+/y mice during 6 weeks after SCI, most likely due to the very low expression of L1 in the adult spinal cord of wild-type mice. L1tg mice, however, showed better locomotor recovery than their L1+/+ littermates, being associated with enhanced numbers of catecholaminergic axons in the lumbar spinal cord, but not of cholinergic, GABAergic or glutamatergic terminals around motoneuron cell bodies in the lumbar spinal cord. Additionally, no difference between L1tg and L1+/+ mice was detectable in dieback of corticospinal tract axons. Neuronal L1 overexpression did not influence the size of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytic scar 6 weeks after injury. We conclude that neuronal overexpression of L1 improves functional recovery from SCI by increasing catecholaminergic axonal regrowth/sprouting and/or sparing of severed axons without affecting the glial scar size.","phosphate","pubmed"

For example, many of the drugs used to treat SCI may interfere with cognitive rehabilitation, and conversely drugs that are used to control seizures in TBI patients may undermine locomotor recovery after SCI. The current paper presents an experimental animal model for combined SCI and TBI to help drive mechanistic studies of dual diagnosis. Rats received a unilateral SCI (75 kdyn) at C5 vertebral level, a unilateral TBI (2.0 mm depth, 4.0 m/s velocity impact on the forelimb sensori-motor cortex), or both SCI+TBI. TBI was placed either contralateral or ipsilateral to the SCI. Behavioral recovery was examined using paw placement in a cylinder, grooming, open field locomotion, and the IBB cereal eating test. Over 6weeks, in the paw placement test, SCI+contralateral TBI produced a profound deficit that failed to recover, but SCI+ipsilateral TBI increased the relative use of the paw on the SCI side. In the grooming test, SCI+contralateral TBI produced worse recovery than either lesion alone even though contralateral TBI alone produced no observable deficit. In the IBB forelimb test, SCI+contralateral TBI revealed a severe deficit that recovered in 3 weeks. For open field locomotion, SCI alone or in combination with TBI resulted in an initial deficit that recovered in 2 weeks. Thus, TBI and SCI affected forelimb function differently depending upon the test, reflecting different neural substrates underlying, for example, exploratory paw placement and stereotyped grooming. Concurrent SCI and TBI had significantly different effects on outcomes and recovery, depending upon laterality of the two lesions. Recovery of function after cervical SCI was retarded by the addition of a moderate TBI in the contralateral hemisphere in all tests, but forepaw placements were relatively increased by an ipsilateral TBI relative to SCI alone, perhaps due to the dual competing injuries influencing the use of both forelimbs. These findings emphasize the complexity of recovery from combined CNS injuries, and the possible role of plasticity and laterality in rehabilitation, and provide a start towards a useful preclinical model for evaluating effective therapies for combine SCI and TBI.","phosphate","pubmed"

EB-induced VWM demyelination significantly reduced spared VWM and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores persisting out to 2 months. Chronic hindlimb dysfunction was accompanied by a persistent inflammatory response (demonstrated by CD45(+) immunofluorescence) and axonal loss (demonstrated by NF-M immunofluorescence and electron microscopy; EM). These cellular responses differ from the rat where inflammation resolves by 3-4 weeks and axon loss is minimal following EB demyelination. As these data suggest that EB-injection in the mouse spinal cord is a non-remyelinating lesion, we sought to ask whether wheel running could promote recovery by enhancing plasticity of local lumbar circuitry independent of remyelination. This did not occur as BMS and Treadscan assessment revealed no significant effect of wheel running on recovery.

Recent experiments in the local application of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) in models of sciatic nerve transection in rats have suggested their beneficial role in nerve regeneration, although the effects of variable doses of stem cells on peripheral nerve regeneration have never been specifically evaluated in the literature. In this paper, the authors evaluated the dose-dependent role of BM-MNCs in peripheral nerve regeneration in a model of sciatic nerve transection in rats. The right sciatic nerve of 60 adult female Wistar rats (randomized into 2 test groups and 1 control group, 20 rats in each group) underwent transection under an operating microscope. The cut ends of the nerve were approximated using 2 epineural microsutures. The gap was filled with low-dose (5 million BM-MNCs/100 μl phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) rat BM-MNCs in one group, high-dose (10 million BM-MNCs/100 μl PBS) rat BM-MNCs in another group, and only PBS in the control group, and the approximated nerve ends were sealed using fibrin glue. Histological assessment was performed after 30 days by using semiquantitative and morphometric analyses and was done to assess axonal regeneration, percentage of myelinated fibers, axonal diameter, fiber diameter, and myelin thickness at distal-most sites (10 mm from site of repair), intermediate distal sites (5 mm distal to the repair site), and site of repair. The recovery of nerve cell architecture after nerve anastomosis was far better in the high-dose BM-MNC group than in the low-dose BM-MNC and control groups, and it was most evident (p < 0.02 in the majority of the parameters [3 of 4]) at the distal-most site. Overall, the improvement in myelin thickness was most significant with incremental dosage of BM-MNCs, and was evident at the repair, intermediate distal, and distal-most sites (p = 0.001). This study emphasizes the role of BM-MNCs, which can be isolated easily from bone marrow aspirates, in peripheral nerve injury and highlights their dose-dependent facilitation of nerve regeneration.","phosphate","pubmed"

The present study examined whether Taxol combined with transplantation of hUCMSCs would produce synergistic effects on recovery and which mechanisms were involved in the effect. A total of 32 rats subjected to SCI procedures were assigned to one of the following four treatment groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, control), hUCMSCs, Taxol, or Taxol+hUCMSCs. Immediately after injury, hUCMSCs were transplanted into the injury site and Taxol was administered intrathecally for 4 weeks. Locomotor recovery was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor (BBB) rating scale. Survival of the transplanted human cells and the host glial reaction in the injured spinal cord were studied by immunohistochemistry. Treatment with Taxol, hUCMSCs or Taxol+hUCMSCs reduced the extent of astrocytic activation, increased axonal preservation and decreased the number of caspase-3(+) and ED-1(+) cells, but these effects were more pronounced in the Taxol+hUCMSCs group.

We have previously shown increases in the lysophospholipid mediator, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), in the spinal cord after contusion injury. To apply S1P receptor modulation to the treatment of SCI, we examined the therapeutic effects of FTY720, an S1P receptor agonist, on locomotor recovery after SCI in mice. Oral administration of FTY720 shortly after contusion SCI significantly improved motor function recovery, as assessed by both Basso Mouse Scale scores and Rotarod Performance test results. FTY720 induced lymphopenia and reduced T-cell infiltration in the spinal cord after SCI but did not affect the early infiltration of neutrophils and the activation of microglia. In addition, plasma levels and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord after SCI were not attenuated by FTY720. Vascular permeability and astrocyte accumulation were both decreased by FTY720 in the injured spinal cord. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were not solely dependent on immune modulation, as confirmed by the demonstration that FTY720 also ameliorated motor function after SCI in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. Finally, the S1P(1) receptor agonist, SEW2871, partly mimicked the therapeutic effect of FTY720. Our data highlight the importance of immune-independent functions of FTY720 in decreasing vascular permeability and astrogliosis in the injured spinal cord and promoting locomotor function recovery after SCI.","phosphate","pubmed"

We pre-differentiated canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into NMSC. A total of 12 dogs subjected to SCI procedures were assigned to one of the following three transplantation treatment groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Matrigel; or Matrigel seeded with NMSC. Treatment occurred 1 week after SCI. Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (B.B.B.) and Tarlov scores, histopathology, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate the treatment effects. Compared with dogs administered PBS or Matrigel alone, dogs treated with Matrigel + NMSC showed significantly better functional recovery 8 weeks after transplantation. Histology and immunochemical analysis revealed that the combination of Matrigel + NMSC reduced fibrosis from secondary injury processes and improved neuronal regeneration more than the other treatments. In addition, the combination of Matrigel + NMSC decreased the expression of inflammation and/or astrogliosis markers. Increased expressions of intracellular molecules related to neuronal extension, neuronal markers and neurotrophic factors were also found in the Matrigel + NMSC group. However, the expression of nestin as a neural stem cell marker was increased with Matrigel alone. The combination of Matrigel + NMSC produced beneficial effects in dogs with regard to functional recovery following SCI through enhancement of anti-inflammation, anti-astrogliosis, neuronal extension and neuronal regeneration effects.","phosphate","pubmed"

We repeated two published studies reporting the beneficial effects of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2'-4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) or Brilliant blue G (BBG) treatment after SCI (Wang et al., 2004 and Peng et al., 2009). Mild thoracic SCI was first produced in Experiment 1 by means of the MASCIS impactor at T10 (height 6.25 mm, weight 10 g) followed by intraspinal administration of a P2X7 antagonist (2 μl/10 mM) after injury. Treatment with PPADS or another highly selective P2X7R antagonist Brilliant Blue G (BBG) (2 μl/02 mM) did not improve locomotive (BBB rating scale) over a 7 week period compared to vehicle treated rats. Also, secondary histopathological changes in terms of overall lesion and cavity volume were not significantly different between the PPADS, BBG, and vehicle treated animals. In the second experiment, the systemic administration of BBG (10 or 50 mg/kg, iv) 15 min, 24 and 72 h after moderate (12.5 mm) SCI failed to significantly improve motor recovery or histopathological outcome over the 6 week observational period. Although we cannot conclude that there will be no long-term beneficial effects in other spinal cord injury models using selective P2X7 receptor antagonists at different doses or treatment durations, we caution researchers that this potentially exciting therapy requires further preclinical investigations before the implementation of clinical trials targeting severe SCI patients.","phosphate","pubmed"

Mature DCs pulsed with spinal cord homogenate (SCH), nonpulsed mature DC or phosphate-buffer solution (PBS) were injected into spinal cord-injured mice peritoneally. The functional recovery of spinal cord was measured by Basso mouse scale and footprint analysis. Spinal cord specimen was preserved for immunohistochemical staining to detect T cell infiltration, differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells, and tissue preservation. RT-PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the expression of cytokines and neurotrophic factors. Vaccination with DCs pulsed with SCH promoted pronounced functional recovery from SCI. The neuroprotection induced by SCH-pulsed DCs (SCH-DC) correlated to the accumulation of CD4(+) T cells in the lesion site. SCH-DC markedly affected the production of interferon-γ, interleukin-12, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. SCH-DC also promoted expression of neurotrophic factors in the injured spinal cord and spleen cells. Furthermore, vaccination with SCH-DC enhanced neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells, and it led to better tissue preservation.

Behavioral analysis and electrophysiological H-reflex recordings revealed that mice transplanted with GFAP-L1 NSCs showed enhanced locomotor recovery in comparison to mice injected with wild type (WT) NSCs or control mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This functional recovery was further accelerated in mice transplanted with L1-expressing radial glial cells that had been immunoisolated from GFAP-L1 NSCs (GFAP-L1-i cells).

After traumatic injury to the CNS, such as spinal cord injury, persistent release of ATP from damaged neurons and activated glial cells occurs, inducing detrimental and/or beneficial effects via activation of ionotropic (P2XR) and metabotropic purinergic receptors. In this study, we show a decrease in GLAST mRNA in the lesion center and caudal portions at 24 h post-spinal cord injury. In an in vitro system, the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate and astrocytic GLAST mRNA levels were significantly decreased after exposure to ATP and its P2X(7)R agonist, 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP. ATP- or 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP-induced inhibitory effect on GLAST mRNA expression was blocked by the irreversible P2X(7)R blocker, oxidized ATP, or when P2X(7)R mRNA expression was reduced by the lentivirus-short hairpin RNA knockdown approach. Furthermore, deletion of the GLAST promoter and RNA decay assays showed that P2X(7)R signaling triggered post-transcriptional regulation of GLAST expression via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase cascade. The signaling pathway participating in the P2X(7)R effect on GLAST mRNA expression was identified as a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase-phospholipase Cgamma involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and protein kinase C. We conclude that P2X(7)R activation by sustained release of ATP in the injured CNS may decrease GLAST mRNA stability via Ca(2+)-dependent signaling, suggesting that inhibition of P2X(7)R may allow for recovery of astrocytic GLAST function and protect neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.","phosphate","pubmed"

The data show that neuroantigen immunizations and 'generic' lymphocyte activation (e.g. PBS/CFA or ovalbumin/CFA immunizations) exacerbated neuron loss above that caused by FNAx alone. We also found that nerve injury potentiated the effector potential of autoimmune lymphocytes. Indeed, prominent forelimb and hindlimb motor deficits were accompanied by disseminated neuroinflammation and demyelination in FNAx mice receiving subencephalitogenic immunization with MOG. FNAx or neuroantigen (MOG or myelin basic protein) immunization alone did not cause these pathological changes. Thus, irrespective of the antigens used to trigger an immune response, neuropathology was enhanced when the immune system was primed in parallel with nerve injury.

Uninjured control mice received a T9 laminectomy only. Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) open-field locomotor rating scales. Next, 4% paraformaldehyde-perfused spinal cords were collected between the T6 and T12 spinal roots, and stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 degrees C until MRI analysis. MRI lesion volumes were determined using T1-weighted images on a 7-Tesla MRI. Histology was performed on 20-microm polyester wax-embedded sections processed from the same spinal cords for stereological determination of fibronectin lesion volume and myelin basic protein spared white matter volume. Area of spared white matter at the epicenter was also analyzed. The results demonstrated that the IH Impactor produced precise, graded contusion SCI in mice. Lesion volumes were positively correlated with force of impact, and negatively correlated with spared white matter and functional recovery. Additionally, similar lesion volumes were detected using fibronectin staining and MRI analysis, although MRI may be more sensitive for milder injuries. These results give researchers more options in how to analyze spinal cord injuries in animal models.","phosphate","pubmed"

Studies on altered gene expression after SCI in these models may identify therapeutic targets for reducing secondary injury after the initial trauma and/or enhancing recovery processes. However, complex spatial and temporal alterations after injury could complicate interpretation of changes in gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we selected six genes and studied their temporal and spatial patterns of expression at 1 h, 1, 3 and 7 days after a standardized spinal cord contusion produced by a weight drop device (10 g x 25 mm at T8). Real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan probes was employed to quantify mRNA for proteolipid protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, nestin, and the GluR2 and NR1 subunits of glutamate receptors. We found widely different temporal and spatial patterns of altered gene expression after SCI, including instances of opposing up- and down-regulation at different locations in tissue immediately adjacent to the injury site. We conclude that greater use of the reliable and extremely sensitive technique of quantitative real-time PCR for regional tissue analysis is important for understanding the altered gene expression that occurs after CNS trauma.","phosphate","pubmed"

Spinal cord neurons expressed P2X7 purine receptors (P2X7R), and exposure to ATP led to high-frequency spiking, irreversible increases in cytosolic calcium and cell death. To assess the potential effect of P2X7R blockade in ameliorating acute spinal cord injury (SCI), we delivered P2X7R antagonists OxATP or PPADS to rats after acute impact injury. We found that both OxATP and PPADS significantly improved functional recovery and diminished cell death in the peritraumatic zone.

We made a soluble chimeric dimer by linking mouse L1 to human Fc. This L1-Fc construct (40 microg/mL) markedly facilitated neurite outgrowth, as well as neuronal adhesion to white matter on frozen sections of spinal cord. We applied L1-Fc intrathecally (200 microg/mL at 0.5 microL/h) to rat spinal cords for 2 weeks after a 25-mm weight drop contusion of the T13 spinal cord. Initial experiments indicated that L1-Fc is present in the spinal cord after 2 weeks of intrathecal infusion and significantly improved locomotor recovery by 6-12 weeks after injury. We then randomized 45 rats to intrathecal infusion of L1-Fc (L1), phosphate-buffered saline controls (PBS), and a mouse monoclonal IgM antibody (M1). By 12 weeks after injury, L1-treated rats recovered significantly (p < 0.005) better locomotor function (BBB score 10.57 +/- 0.25, n = 14) than PBS-treated rats (BBB score 9.00 +/- 0.33, n = 14) or M1-treated (BBB score 8.71 +/- 0.16, n = 14). Only two rats of 22 treated with saline recovered weight-supported ambulation. Of 20 L1-Fc-treated rats, however, 18 recovered weight-supported walking by 12 weeks. The L1-Fc-treated rats also showed more consistent hindlimb contact placing than saline controls. We injected biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the motor cortices of 14 rats treated with L1-Fc to label corticospinal axons, comparing these with 13 rats treated with saline. In saline-treated rats, BDA-labeled corticospinal axons often grew up to the impact edge and occasionally into the impact site. L1-treated rats showed longer corticospinal tract growth at the injury site. Three rats had BDA-labeled axons that extended beyond the impact center. One L1-Fc-treated rat showed axonal extension and synapse formation in cord distal to the injury. These results indicate that soluble L1-Fc promotes axonal growth and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. However, the limited corticospinal tract growth across the injury site cannot account for the observed locomotor recovery. Thus, L1 may be stimulating growth of other motor tracts or protecting axons and neurons. More studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of L1-Fc-induced locomotor recovery.","phosphate","pubmed"

While several mechanisms were proposed to account for these effects, limited information exists regarding GC actions in sensory areas of the spinal cord. Presently, we studied the time course of Fos expression, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical staining to monitor neuronal responses to SCI with or without GC treatment. Rats with sham-operation or transection at the thoracic level (T7-T8) received vehicle or 5 mg/kg of the GC dexamethasone (DEX) at 5 min post-lesion and were sacrificed 2 or 4 h after surgery. Another group of SCI rats received vehicle or intensive DEX treatment (5 min, 6 h, 18 h and 46 h post-lesion) and were sacrificed 48 h after surgery. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons or Fos immunoreactive nuclei was studied by computer-assisted image analysis in superficial dorsal horn (Laminae I-III) and central canal area (Lamina X) below the lesion. While constitutive Fos immunoreactive nuclei were sparse in controls, SCI increased Fos expression at 2 and 4 h after injury. DEX treatment significantly enhanced the number of Fos positive nuclei in Laminae I-III by 4 h after transection, although the response was not maintained by intensive steroid treatment when tested at 48 h after SCI. NADPH-d positive neurons in Laminae I-III increased at 2 and 4 h after SCI while a delayed increased was found in central canal area (Lamina X). DEX treatment decreased NADPH-d positive neurons to sham-operated levels at all time points examined. Thus, while GC stimulation of Fos suggests activation of neurons involved in sympathetic outflow and/or pain, down-regulation of NADPH-d indicates attenuation of nociceptive outflow, considering the role of enzyme-derived nitric oxide in pain-related mechanisms. Differential hormonal effects on these molecules agree with their localization in different cell populations.","phosphate","pubmed"

Hindlimb motor function was assessed as the BBB open field locomotor scores. The BBB scores of three groups treated with either PC-SOD (40,000 units/kg), MP (30 mg/kg), or a combination of PC-SOD and MP (PC-SOD+MP) increased with time until 3 days after SCI, and were significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). Thereafter, the score of the PC-SOD group increased, whereas that of the MP group showed a temporary decrease from day 3 to 5 and then it gradually recovered. The scores in all groups reached a plateau about 18 days after SCI. The PC-SOD+MP group did not show a synergism but a tendency similar to that of the MP group. PC-SOD and MP had down-regulatory effects on mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and inducible-nitric oxide synthetase (i-NOS) after spinal cord compression at 3, 6, and 24 h, respectively, as judged by a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and on the lipid peroxide (LPO) level 1 h after injury as determined by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The suppression of pro-inflammatory genes expression, especially IL-1beta were greater in the MP group than in the PC-SOD group, while suppression of LPO level was similar in these two groups. PC-SOD+MP treatment augmented the suppression of all three pro-inflammatory genes expression and the decrease of the LPO level. The level of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA increased from 6 h after SCI and reached a maximum after 48 h. NT-3 mRNA level was enhanced by PC-SOD treatment, but not by MP treatment. Thus, the effect of MP in suppressing these pro-inflammatory genes expression was more than that of PC-SOD. The difference in motor function in the early and later stage may be partially due to differences in expression of IL-1beta and NT-3 after either treatment, through an IL-1beta-dependent or NT-3-mediated repair response.","phosphate","pubmed"

In the current study, we additionally assessed the protective efficacy of pioglitazone treatment on acute mitochondrial respiration, as well as functional and anatomical recovery after contusion SCI in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Mice received either vehicle or pioglitazone (10mg/kg) at either 15min or 3h after injury (75kdyn at T9) followed by a booster at 24h post-injury. At 25h, mitochondria were isolated from spinal cord segments centered on the injury epicenters and assessed for their respiratory capacity. Results showed significantly compromised mitochondrial respiration 25h following SCI, but pioglitazone treatment that was initiated either at 15min or 3h post-injury significantly maintained mitochondrial respiration rates near sham levels. A second cohort of injured mice received pioglitazone at 15min post injury, then once a day for 5days post-injury to assess locomotor recovery and tissue sparing over 4weeks. Compared to vehicle, pioglitazone treatment resulted in significantly greater recovery of hind-limb function over time, as determined by serial locomotor BMS assessments and both terminal BMS subscores and gridwalk performance. Such improvements correlated with significantly increased grey and white matter tissue sparing, although pioglitazone treatment did not abrogate long-term injury-induced inflammatory microglia/macrophage responses. In sum, pioglitazone significantly increased functional neuroprotection that was associated with remarkable maintenance of acute mitochondrial bioenergetics after traumatic SCI. This sets the stage for dose-response and delayed administration studies to maximize pioglitazone's efficacy for SCI while elucidating the precise role that mitochondria play in governing its neuroprotection; the ultimate goal to develop novel therapeutics that specifically target mitochondrial dysfunction.","pioglitazone","pubmed"

Treatment of SCI still remains a tremendous challenge clinically. Minocycline could target comprehensive secondary injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a known sealing agent, is able to seal the damaged cell membranes and reduce calcium influx, thereby exerting neuroprotective capacity. Here, an E-selectin-targeting sialic acid - polyethylene glycol - poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SAPP) copolymer was designed for delivering hydrophobic minocycline to achieve combinational therapy of SCI. The obtained SAPP copolymer could self-assemble into micelles with critical micelle concentration being of 13.40 μg/mL, and effectively encapsulate hydrophobic minocycline. The prepared drug-loaded micelles (SAPPM) displayed sustained drug release over 72 h, which could stop microglia activation and exhibited excellent neuroprotective capacity in vitro. The SAPP micelles were efficiently accumulated in the lesion site of SCI rats via the specific binding between sialic acid and E-selectin. Due to the targeting distribution and combinational effect between PEG and minocycline, SAPPM could obviously reduce the area of lesion cavity, and realize more survival of axons and myelin sheaths from the injury, thus distinctly improving hindlimb functional recovery of SCI rats and conferring superior therapeutic effect in coparison with other groups. Our work presented an effective and safe strategy for SCI targeting therapy. Besides, neuroprotective capacity of PEG deserves further investigation on other central nervous system diseases.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

A neuron's response to axon injury results from a complex interplay of neuron-intrinsic and environmental factors. The contribution of axotomy to the death of neurons in spinal cord injury is controversial because very remote axotomy is unlikely to result in neuronal death, whereas death of neurons near an injury may reflect environmental factors such as ischemia and inflammation. In lampreys, axotomy due to spinal cord injury results in delayed apoptosis of spinal-projecting neurons in the brain, beyond the extent of these environmental factors. This retrograde apoptosis correlates with delayed resealing of the axon, and can be reversed by inducing rapid membrane resealing with polyethylene glycol. Studies in mammals also suggest that polyethylene glycol may be neuroprotective, although the mechanism(s) remain unclear. This review examines the early, mechanical, responses to axon injury in both mammals and lampreys, and the potential of polyethylene glycol to reduce injury-induced pathology. Identifying the mechanisms underlying a neuron's response to axotomy will potentially reveal new therapeutic targets to enhance regeneration and functional recovery in humans with spinal cord injury.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

In this study, we aim to develop a clinically feasible way for targeted delivery of multiple drugs with different physiochemical properties to the SCI site, detail the underlying mechanism of neural recovery, and detect any synergistic effect related to combination therapy. Methods: Liposomes (LIP) modified with a scar-targeted tetrapeptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) were first constructed to simultaneously encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and then were further added into a thermosensitive heparin-modified poloxamer hydrogel (HP) with affinity-bound acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF-HP) for local administration into the SCI site (CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP) in a rat model. In vivo fluorescence imaging was used to examine the specificity of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX binding to the injured site. Multiple comprehensive evaluations including biotin dextran amine anterograde tracing and magnetic resonance imaging were used to detect any synergistic effects and the underlying mechanisms of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP both in vivo (rat SCI model) and in vitro (primary neuron). Results: The multiple drugs were effectively delivered to the injured site. The combined application of GFs and DTX supported neuro-regeneration by improving neuronal survival and plasticity, rendering a more permissive extracellular matrix environment with improved regeneration potential. In addition, our combination therapy promoted axonal regeneration via moderation of microtubule function and mitochondrial transport along the regenerating axon. Conclusion: This novel multifunctional therapeutic strategy with a scar-homing delivery system may offer promising translational prospects for the clinical treatment of SCI.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Three distinct thiolated chitosan precursors were made by varying reaction conditions; a modification of chitosan with Traut's reagent (2-iminothiolane) displayed the most attractive hydrogel properties once mixed with polyethylene glycol. The final hydrogel chosen for animal testing had a swelling ratio (Q) of 57.5 ± 3.4 and elastic modulus of 378 ± 72 Pa.

The rats displayed no overt functional deficits due to injection following initial surgical recovery and throughout the 2-week period after for both the saline-injected sham group and hydrogel-injected group. The saline and hydrogel-injected animals both showed a similar response from ED1+ microglia and GFAP overexpression. No significant differences were found between saline-injected and hydrogel-injected groups for any of the measures studied, but there was a trend toward decreased affected area size from 1 to 2 weeks in both groups.

In this study, the AFG was implanted into a rat dorsal hemisected spinal cord injury model to bridge the lesion site. Host cells invaded promptly along the aligned fibrin hydrogels to form aligned tissue cables in the first week, and then were followed by axonal regrowth. At 4 weeks after the surgery, neurofilament (NF)-positive staining fibers were detected near the rostral end as well as the middle site of defect, which aligned along the tissue cables. Abundant NF- and GAP-43-positive staining indicated new axon regrowth in the oriented tissue cables, which penetrated throughout the lesion site in 8 weeks. Additionally, the abundant blood vessels marked with RECA-1 had reconstructed within the lesion site at 4 weeks after surgery. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scoring showed that the locomotor performance of the AFG group recovered much faster than that of blank control group or the random fibrin hydrogel (RFG) group from 2 weeks after surgery. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging tractography of MRI confirmed the optimal axon fiber reconstruction compared with the RFG and control groups.

Glial scar formation in chronic injury is a likely contributor to limitation on regeneration. We have removed existing scar tissue in chronically contused rat spinal cord using a rose Bengal-based photo ablation approach. In this study, we compared two chemically modified rose bengal derivatives to unmodified rose bengal, both confirming and expanding on our previously published report. Rats were treated with unmodified rose bengal (RB1) or rose bengal modified with hydrocarbon (RB2) or polyethylene glycol (RB3), to determine the effects on scar components and spared tissue post-treatment. Our results showed that RB1 was more efficacious than RB2, while still maintaining minimal collateral effects on spared tissue. RB3 was not taken up by the cells, likely because of its size, and therefore had no effect. Treatment with RB1 also resulted in an increase in serotonin eight days post-treatment in chronically injured spinal cords. Thus, we suggest that unmodified rose Bengal is a potent candidate agent for the development of a therapeutic strategy for scar ablation in chronic SCI.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

We designed a scaffold material for SCI treatment containing only chitosan and water as fragmented physical hydrogel suspension (Chitosan-FPHS), with defined degree of acetylation (DA), polymer concentration, and mean fragment size. Implantation of Chitosan-FPHS alone into rat spinal cord immediately after a bilateral dorsal hemisection promoted reconstitution of spinal tissue and vasculature, and diminished fibrous glial scarring: with astrocyte processes primarily oriented towards the lesion, the border between lesion site and intact tissue became permissive for regrowth of numerous axons into, and for some even beyond the lesion site. Growing axons were myelinated or ensheathed by endogenous Schwann cells that migrated into the lesion site and whose survival was prolonged. Interestingly, Chitosan-FPHS also modulated the inflammatory response, and we suggest that this might contribute to tissue repair. Finally, this structural remodeling was associated with significant, long-lasting gain in locomotor function recovery.

We hypothesized that tissue and functional repair would be achieved in a rat model of impact-compression SCI by combining degradation of the glial scar, using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), with recruitment of endogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs), using stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF). To test this hypothesis, we designed a crosslinked methylcellulose hydrogel (XMC) for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal drug delivery. ChABC was released from XMC using protein-peptide affinity interactions while SDF was delivered by electrostatic affinity interactions from polymeric nanoparticles embedded in XMC. Rats with SCI were treated acutely with a combination of SDF and ChABC, SDF alone, ChABC alone, or vehicle alone, and compared to injury only. Treatment with ChABC, both alone and in combination with SDF, resulted in faster and more sustained behavioural improvement over time than other groups. The significantly reduced chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan levels and greater distribution of NPCs throughout the spinal cord tissue with ChABC delivery, both alone and in combination with SDF, may explain the improved locomotor function. Treatment with SDF alone had no apparent effect on NPC number or distribution nor synergistic effect with ChABC delivery.

Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective. Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we aimed to investigate if their neuroprotective efficacy could be cumulative. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of combined administration of riluzole and magnesium chloride in a contusive model of thoracic spinal cord injury. An in vivo experiment was set using female Wistar Han rats that underwent a thoracic spinal cord contusion (T8) using a weight drop method. An hour after injury, animals were randomly distributed to receive (1) saline, (2) riluzole (2.50 mg/kg), (3) magnesium chloride (24.18 mg/kg) in a polyethylene glycol formulation, or (4) a combined treatment (riluzole and magnesium). Subsequent treatments were given in four intraperitoneal injections (spaced 12 hours apart). The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, an activity box test, and a swimming test were used to evaluate behavioral recovery over a 4-week period. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords was performed to measure the extent and volume of the lesion, axonal preservation, serotonergic and glutamatergic fiber sparing, motor neuron survival, and inflammation. Our results show that only the riluzole treatment significantly improved behavioral recovery up to 4 weeks after injury when compared with saline controls (6.2±1.8), with animals achieving weight-supported stepping (9.1±1.2). Riluzole also promoted tissue sparing with significant differences achieved from 200 to 600 µm (caudally to the lesion epicenter), and reduced lesion volume, with animals presenting a significantly smaller lesion (3.23±0.26 mm(3)) when compared with the saline-treated group (4.74±0.80 mm(3)), representing a 32% decrease in lesion volume. Riluzole treatment induced significant axonal preservation, as well as serotonergic fiber sparing, caudally to the injury epicenter. Our results suggest that the combined treatment, although simultaneously targeting two excitotoxic-related mechanisms, did not further improve behavioral and histologic outcome when compared with riluzole given alone.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Data showed that the injury potential and ion concentration of the untreated, PEG and DSPE-PEG group, without significant difference among them, are remarkably higher than those of the intact group. Moreover, the CAP recovery of the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated spinal cords was significantly greater than that of the untreated spinal cords. The level of CAP recovery in the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated groups was the same, but the concentration of DSPE-PEG used was much lower than the concentration of PEG.

In this study, this bridge is tested, consisting of adult neural stem/progenitor cells contained within a methacrylamide chitosan (MAC) hydrogel and protected by a chitosan conduit.

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Here we show that intraspinal delivery of PEG-functionalized 40-nm-AuNPs at early stages after mouse spinal cord injury is beneficial for recovery. Positive outcome of hind limb motor function was accompanied by attenuated inflammatory response, enhanced motor neuron survival, and increased myelination of spared or regrown/sprouted axons.

Three-dimensional (3D) electrospun poly (lactide-co-glycolide)/polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanofiber scaffolds were used for iNSCs adhesion and growth. Cell growth, survival and proliferation on the scaffolds were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nuclei staining were used to assess cell growth on the scaffolds. Scaffolds with iNSCs were then transplanted into transected rat spinal cords. Two or 8 weeks following transplantation, immunofluorescence was performed to determine iNSC survival and differentiation within the scaffolds. Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Scale. Results indicated that iNSCs showed similar morphological features with wild-type neural stem cells (wt-NSCs), and expressed a variety of neural stem cell marker genes. Furthermore, iNSCs were shown to survive, with the ability to self-renew and undergo neural differentiation into neurons and glial cells within the 3D scaffolds in vivo. The iNSC-seeded scaffolds restored the continuity of the spinal cord and reduced cavity formation. Additionally, iNSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to functional recovery of the spinal cord. Therefore, PLGA-PEG scaffolds seeded with iNSCs may serve as promising supporting transplants for repairing spinal cord injury (SCI).","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Spinal cord injury (SCI) diminishes the integrity of neural fiber membranes at nanoscopic level. In cases that the ruptured zone size is beyond the natural resealing ability, there is a need for reinforcing factors such as polymers (e.g. Polyethylene glycol) to patch the dismantled axoplasm. Certain conserved sequential and structural patterns of interacting residues specifically bind to PEGs. It is also found that PEG600, PEG400 and PEG200 share the strongest interaction with the lipid-binding domains even more successful than phospholipid head groups. The alpha helix structure composed of hydrophobic, neutral and acidic residues prepares an opportunity for PEG400 to play an amphipathic role in the interaction with injured membrane.

It is believed that PEG400 interrelates the injured membrane to their underneath axoplasm while retaining the integrity of ruptured membrane via interaction with ENTH domains of membrane proteins.

By combining three ingredients currently in clinical use or undergoing testing, we have designed a central nervous system targeted delivery system based on apamin-modified polymeric micelles (APM). Apamin, one of the major components of honey bee venom, serves as the targeting moiety, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) serves as the drug-loaded material, and curcumin is used as the therapeutic agent. Apamin was conjugated with NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide)-PEG-DSPE in a site-specific manner, and APM were prepared by a thin-film hydration method. A formulation comprising 0.5 mol % targeting ligand with 50 nm particle size showed strong targeting efficiency in vivo and was evaluated in pharmacodynamic assays. A 7-day treatment by daily intravenous administration of low doses of APM (corresponding to 5 mg/kg of curcumin) was performed. Significantly enhanced recovery and prolonged survival was found in the SCI mouse model, as compared to sham-treated groups, with no apparent toxicity. A single dose of apamin-conjugated polymers was about 700-fold lower than the LD50 amount, suggesting that APM and apamin have potential for clinical applications as spinal cord targeting ligand for delivery of agents in treatment of diseases of the central nervous system.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Five weeks after dorsal thoracic hemisection injury the lesion scar was resected via aspiration and the resulting cavity was filled with different biopolymers such as Matrigel™, alginate-hydrogel and polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG) all of which have not previously been used as sole graft-materials in chronic SCI. Immunohistological staining revealed marked differences between these compounds regarding axon regeneration, invasion/elongation of astrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial and Schwann cells, revascularization, and collagen deposition. According to axon regeneration-supporting effects, the biopolymers could be ranked in the order PEG>alginate-hydrogel>Matrigel™. Even after complete chronic transection, the PEG-bridge allowed long-distance axon regeneration through the grafted area and for, at least, 1cm beyond the lesion/graft border. As revealed by electron microscopy, bundles of regenerating axons within the matrix area received myelin ensheathment from Schwann cells. The beneficial effects of PEG-implantation into the resection-cavity were accompanied by long-lasting significant locomotor improvement over a period of 8months. Following complete spinal re-transection at the rostral border of the PEG-graft the locomotor recovery was aborted, suggesting a functional role of regenerated axons in the initial locomotor improvement. In conclusion, scar resection and subsequent implantation of PEG into the generated cavity leads to tissue recovery, axon regeneration, myelination and functional improvement that have not been achieved before in severe chronic SCI.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Thus, PEG repairs mechanically injured cells by at least two distinct pathways: resealing of the disrupted plasma membrane and direct protection of mitochondria. Besides repairing primary membrane damage, PEG treatment also results in significant attenuation of oxidative stress, likely due to its capacity to reseal the membrane, thereby breaking the cycle of cellular damage and free-radical production. Based on this, in addition to the practicality of its application, we expect that PEG may be established as an effective treatment for SCI where membrane disruption and mitochondrial damage are implicated.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Here, we have assessed the possible synergistic effects of PEG and temperature on the repair of neural membranes in an SCI model. The effects of PEGs (400, 1,000 and 2,000 Da) were studied at different temperatures (25, 37 and 40 °C) by means of compound action potential (CAP) recovery and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Isolated spinal cords were mounted in a double sucrose gap chamber, where the amplitude and area of CAPs were recorded after implementing injury, in the presence and absence of PEG. Moreover, the LDH assay was used to assess the effects of PEG on membrane resealing. Data showed that the least CAP recovery occurred at 25 °C, followed by 37 and 40 °C, in all treated groups. Moreover, maximum CAP amplitude recovery, 65.46 ± 5.04 %, was monitored in the presence of PEG400 at 40 °C, followed by 41.49 ± 2.41 % in PEG1000 and 37.36 ± 1.62 % in PEG2000. Furthermore, raising the temperature from 37 to 40 °C significantly increased CAP recovery in the PEG2000 group. Similar recovery patterns were obtained by CAP area measurements and LDH assay. The results suggest that application of low-molecular weight PEG (PEG400) in mild hyperthermia conditions (40 °C) provides the optimum condition for membrane sealing in SCI model.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

The primary aim of this work was to assess the recovery of both spontaneous and skilled forelimb function following a cervical dorsolateral funiculotomy in the rat. This injury ablates the rubrospinal tract (RST) but spares the dorsal and ventral corticospinal tract and can severely impair reaching and grasping abilities. Animals received an implant of either PNIPAAm-g-PEG or PNIPAAm-g-PEG + brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The single-pellet reach-to-grasp task and the staircase-reaching task were used to assess skilled motor function associated with reaching and grasping abilities, and the cylinder task was used to assess spontaneous motor function, both before and after injury. Because BDNF can stimulate regenerating RST axons, the authors showed that animals receiving an implant of PNIPAAm-g-PEG with codissolved BDNF had an increased recovery rate of fine motor function when compared with a control group (PNIPAAm-g-PEG only) on both a staircase-reaching task at 4 and 8 weeks post-SCI and on a single-pellet reach-to-grasp task at 5 weeks post-SCI. In addition, spontaneous motor function, as measured in the cylinder test, recovered to preinjury values in animals receiving PNIPAAm-g-PEG + BDNF. Fluorescence immunochemistry indicated the presence of both regenerating axons and BDA-labeled fibers growing up to or within the host-graft interface in animals receiving PNIPAAm-g-PEG + BDNF.

The possibility for selectivity of tetramethyl rhodamine-dextran (TMR) dye-doped, PEG-functionalized silica nanoparticles (TMR-PSiNPs) to damaged spinal cord was evaluated using an ex vivo model of guinea pig SCI. Crushed and nearby undamaged spinal cord tissues exhibited an obvious difference in both the imbibement and accumulation of the TMR-PSiNPs, revealing selective labeling of compression-injured tissues. These data show that appropriately functionalized nanoparticles can be an efficient means to both 1.) carry drugs, and 2.) apply membrane repair agents where they are needed in focally damaged nervous tissue.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

In addition to parenchymal injury, a subset of patients experience severe inflammation in the subarachnoid space or arachnoiditis, which can lead to the development of fluid-filled cavities/syringes, a condition called post-traumatic syringomyelia (PTS). Currently, there are no therapeutic means to address this devastating complication in patients and furthermore once PTS is diagnosed, treatment is often prone to failure. We hypothesized that reducing subarachnoid inflammation using a novel bioengineered strategy would improve outcome in a rodent model of PTS. A hydrogel of hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) was injected into the subarachnoid space 24 h post PTS injury in rats. Intrathecal injection of HAMC reduced the extent of fibrosis and inflammation in the subarachnoid space. Furthermore, HAMC promoted improved neurobehavioural recovery, enhanced axonal conduction and reduced the extent of the lesion as assessed by MRI and histomorphometric assessment. These findings were additionally associated with a reduction in the post-traumatic parenchymal fibrous scar formation as evidenced by reduced CSPG deposition and reduced IL-1α cytokine levels. Our data suggest that HAMC is capable of modulating inflammation and scarring events, leading to improved functional recovery following severe SCI associated with arachnoiditis.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

We hypothesized that administration of SWNT-PEG after experimental SCI will promote regeneration of axons into the lesion cavity and functional recovery of the hindlimbs. To evaluate this hypothesis, complete transection SCI was induced at the T9 vertebral level in adult female rats. One week after transection, the epicenter of the lesion was injected with 25??L of either vehicle (saline), or 1??g/mL, 10??g/mL, or 100??g/mL of SWNT-PEG. Behavioral analysis was conducted before injury, before treatment, and once every 7 days for 28 days after treatment. At 28 days post-injection the rats were euthanized and spinal cord tissue was extracted. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the area of the cyst, the extent of the glial scar, and axonal morphology. We found that post-SCI administration of SWNT-PEG decreased lesion volume, increased neurofilament-positive fibers and corticospinal tract fibers in the lesion, and did not increase reactive gliosis. Additionally, post-SCI administration of SWNT-PEG induced a modest improvement in hindlimb locomotor recovery without inducing hyperalgesia. These data suggest that SWNT-PEG may be an effective material to promote axonal repair and regeneration after SCI.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Intravenously administered magnesium has been extensively investigated as a neuroprotective agent in animal models of SCI, stroke, and traumatic brain injuries, and has been evaluated in large scale clinical trials for the latter 2 indications. We have developed a novel formulation of magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) within PEG, and have previously demonstrated the neuroprotective benefit of this formulation in animal models of thoracic SCI. Twenty-two Sprague Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical hemicontusion at C4-C5 and were randomized 2 hours later to either the MgCl₂ in PEG formulation, or normal saline. Each treatment was administered in 5 intravenous infusions spaced 6 hours apart. Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks, after which the cord was analyzed to measure the extent of gray matter and white matter sparing through the injury site. In the horizontal ladder test, the percentage of forelimb errors made by the animals treated with MgCl₂ in PEG formulation was significantly lower than the saline-treated controls. Histologic analysis also revealed a significantly higher cumulative white matter sparing through the injury site in the MgCl₂ in PEG group. MgCl₂ in a PEG formulation reduced secondary damage and improved behavioral recovery when administered 2 hours after a unilateral cervical hemicontusion injury. These findings are consistent with the neurologic benefit observed when administering this magnesium formulation in contusive and compressive models of thoracic SCI. Demonstrating the robustness of this neuroprotective effect in multiple injury models (and in the cervical injury model in particular) is important when considering the applicability of such a therapy for human SCIs.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

This leads to a cumulative deterioration of neurons, axons, and the tissue architecture of the cord. We have previously shown that the application of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) following spinal cord or brain injury can rapidly restore membrane integrity, reduce oxidative stress, restore impaired axonal conductivity, and mediate functional recovery in rats, guinea pigs, and dogs. However there are limits to both the concentration and the molecular weight of the application that do not permit the broadest recovery across an injured animal population. In this study, PEG-decorated silica nanoparticles (PSiNPs) sealed cells, as shown by the significantly reduced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from damaged cells compared with uncoated particles or PEG alone. Further in vivo tests showed that PSiNPs also significantly reduced the formation of reactive oxygen species and the process of lipid peroxidation of the membrane. Fabrication of PSiNPs containing embedded dyes also revealed targeting of the particles to damaged, but not undamaged, spinal cord tissues. In an in vivo crush/contusion model of guinea pig SCI, every animal but one injected with PSiNPs recovered conduction through the cord lesion, whereas none of the control animals did. These findings suggest that the use of multifunctional nanoparticles may offer a novel treatment approach for spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and possibly neurodegenerative disorders.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Previously, we showed that polyethylene glycol (PEG) can reseal axonal membranes following compression in isolated guinea pig spinal cord white matter. We now report that 10 mM PEG can also significantly enhance membrane resealing following transection in the clinically relevant conditions of low extracellular Ca(2+) and low temperature. Such beneficial effects were demonstrated both functionally, through membrane potential measured by double sucrose gap apparatus, and anatomically, through horseradish peroxidase and tetramethyl rhodamine dextran dye exclusion assays. We further noted that axons with small diameters preferentially benefited from PEG-mediated axolemmal resealing. Using atomic force microscopy, we further showed that PEG can effectively reduce neuronal membrane surface tension. We hypothesize that PEG may promote axolemmal resealing by increasing membrane line tension and reducing membrane tension, thus creating conditions more favorable to membrane resealing. In summary, these studies suggest that PEG is effective under the clinically relevant conditions of low Ca(2+) and temperature, and thus has the potential to be used in combination with other more established interventions in spinal cord and traumatic brain injury.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

In proof-of-principle experiments using a pin-drop organotypic culture model of SCI, PEG attenuated neural cell death. Adult rats underwent 35-g clip compression SCI at C8 and were randomized postinjury to receive intravenous 30% PEG or sterile Ringer's lactate solution. Confocal microscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography of fluorescein-conjugated PEG permitted in vivo quantification of PEG concentrations in the injured and uninjured spinal cord. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining demonstrated that PEG reduced 200-kd neurofilament degradation and apoptotic cell death. Polyethylene glycol also promoted spinal cord tissue sparing based on retrograde axonal Fluoro-Gold tracing and morphometric histological assessment. Polyethylene glycol also promoted significant, although modest, neurobehavioral recovery after SCI. Collectively, these results indicate that PEG protects key axonal cytoskeletal proteins after SCI, and that the protection is associated with axonal preservation.

To develop magnesium into a clinically relevant therapy for SCI, further refinement and improvement of the magnesium formulation is necessary. In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007). We established that the 254 micromol/kg dose of MgCl(2) was superior to 127 micromol/kg MgCl(2) with respect to tissue sparing and locomotor recovery. Additionally, the number of infusions (2, 4, or 6), time between infusions (6 vs 8 hours), and different magnesium salts (MgCl(2) vs MgSO(4)) were evaluated to determine an ""optimal"" treatment regimen. We observed that an ""optimized"" regimen of MgCl(2) within PEG conferred greater tissue neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery compared to methylprednisolone. Further a 4 hour time window of histologic and behavioral efficacy was established. The goal of these experiments was to help guide the treatment parameters for a clinical trial of magnesium within a polyethylene glycol formulation in acute human spinal cord injury.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

This repair is achieved following spontaneous reassembly of cell membranes made possible by the action of targeted hydrophilic polymers which first seal the compromised portion of the plasmalemma, and secondarily, allow the lipidic core of the compromised membranes to resolve into each other. Here we compared PEG-treated to untreated rats using a computer-managed open-field behavioral test subsequent to a standardized brain injury. Animals were evaluated after a 2-, 4-, and 6-hour delay in treatment after TBI. Treated animals receive a single subcutaneous injection of PEG. When treated within 2 hours of the injury, injured PEG-treated rats showed statistically significant improvement in their exploratory behavior recorded in the activity box when compared to untreated but brain-injured controls. A delay of 4 hours reduced this level of achievement, but a statistically significant improvement due to PEG injection was still clearly evident in most outcome measures compared at the various evaluation times. A further delay of 2 more hours, however, eradicated the beneficial effects of PEG injection as revealed using this behavioral assessment. Thus, there appears to be a critical window of time in which PEG administration after TBI can provide neuroprotection resulting in an enhanced functional recovery. As is often seen in clinically applied acute treatments for trauma, the earlier the intervention can be applied, the better the outcome.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

Outcome measures consisted of measurements of voluntary ambulation, deep and superficial pain perception, conscious proprioception in hindlimbs, and evoked potentials (somatosensory evoked potentials [SSEP]). We determined that polymer injection is a safe adjunct to the conventional management of severe neurological injury in dogs. We did not observe any unacceptable clinical response to polymer injection; there were no deaths, nor any other problem arising from, or associated with, the procedures. Outcome measures over the 6-8-week trial were improved by polymer injection when compared to historical cases. This recovery was unexpectedly rapid compared to these comparator groups. The results of this pilot trial provides evidence consistent with the notion that the injection of inorganic polymers in acute neurotrauma may be a simple and useful intervention during the acute phase of the injury.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

We show that a compression injury at T10-11 induced diffusive oxidative stress in crude synaptosomal preparations, correlated with synaptosomal dysfunction and increased intrasynaptosomal calcium. Administration of PEG immediately post-injury produced a marked decrease in synaptosomal oxidative stress and calcium, associated with an increase in synaptosomal function. Confocal microscopy using fluorescein conjugated PEG revealed that PEG entered the cells of the injured spinal cord, placing the polymer in a position to directly interact with cellular organelles. PEG attenuates calcium-induced functional compromise of normal spinal cord synaptosomes and mitochondria in vitro. These results indicate that PEG may exert its neuroprotective effect through direct interaction with mitochondria, besides its known ability to rescue neurons and their axons by repairing the plasma membranes. We submit that PEG is likely to interfere with the cascade of secondary injury by several mechanisms of action that in concert reduce oxidative stress.","polyethylene_glycol","pubmed"

These observations stood out against a control group in blinded evaluation. Conduction through the lesion was monitored by stimulating the tibial nerve of the hind limb, and measuring the arrival of evoked potentials at the contralateral sensory cortex of the brain (somatosensory evoked potentials; SSEP). Behavioral recovery was determined by a return of sensitivity of formerly areflexic receptive fields of the cutaneous trunchi muscle (CTM) reflex.

This reflex is observed as a contraction of the skin of the back in response to tactile stimulation. Here, we confirm and extend these preliminary observations. A severe compression/contusion injury to the exposed thoracic spinal cord of the guinea pig was performed between thoracic vertebrae 10 and 11. Approximately 7 h later, a topical application of PEG was made to the injury (dura removed) for 2 min in 15 experimental animals, and levels of recovery were compared with those of 13 vehicle-treated control animals.

Using a fluorescein decorated PEG, we demonstrate that the polymer specifically targets the hemorrhagic contusion of the adult guinea pig spinal cord when administered through the vasculature, but not intact regions of the spinal cord. A single subcutaneous injection (30% weight by weight in sterile saline) made 6 hr after a standardized spinal cord contusion in adult guinea pigs was sufficient to produce a rapid recovery of SSEP propagation through the lesion in only PEG-treated animals, accompanied by a statistically significant recovery of the CTM reflex.

The potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2, SLC12A5) is a key modulator of inhibitory GABAergic inputs in healthy adult neurons, as its chloride (Cl-) extruding activity underlies the hyperpolarizing reversal potential for GABAA receptor Cl- currents (EGABA). Manipulation of KCC2 levels or activity improve symptoms associated with epilepsy and neuropathy. Recent works have now indicated that pharmacological enhancement of KCC2 function could reactivate dormant relay circuits in an injured mouse's spinal cord, leading to functional recovery and the attenuation of neuronal abnormality and disease phenotype associated with a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT). KCC2 interacts with Huntingtin and is downregulated in Huntington's disease (HD), which contributed to GABAergic excitation and memory deficits in the R6/2 mouse HD model. Here, these recent advances are highlighted, which attest to KCC2's growing potential as a therapeutic target for neuropathological conditions resulting from dysfunctional inhibitory input.","potassium_chloride","pubmed"

It is unknown why spared axons fail to mediate functional recovery in these cases. To investigate this, we undertook a small-molecule screen in mice with staggered bilateral hemisections in which the lumbar spinal cord is deprived of all direct brain-derived innervation, but dormant relay circuits remain. We discovered that a KCC2 agonist restored stepping ability, which could be mimicked by selective expression of KCC2, or hyperpolarizing DREADDs, in the inhibitory interneurons between and around the staggered spinal lesions. Mechanistically, these treatments transformed this injury-induced dysfunctional spinal circuit to a functional state, facilitating the relay of brain-derived commands toward the lumbar spinal cord. Thus, our results identify spinal inhibitory interneurons as a roadblock limiting the integration of descending inputs into relay circuits after injury and suggest KCC2 agonists as promising treatments for promoting functional recovery after spinal cord injury.","potassium_chloride","pubmed"

SCI models were established in SD rats. Five groups were set up randomly: normal control group, SCI 7-day (7D) model group, SCI 14-day (14D) model group, SCI-7D rTMS group and SCI-14D rTMS group (n=5 each). The rats in SCI rTMS groups were treated with 10 Hz rTMS from 8th day and 15th day after SCI respectively, once every day, 5 days every week, a total of 4 weeks. After the model establishment, motor recovery and spasticity alleviation were evaluated with BBB scale once a week till the end of treatment. Finally, different parts of tissues were dissected out for detection of variations of KCC2 protein using Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The results showed that the BBS scores after treatment were significantly higher in SCI-7D rTMS group than in SCI-14D rTMS group (P<0.05). As compared with normal control groups, The KCC2 protein in SCI model groups was down-regulated after SCI, and the decrease was much more significant in SCI-14D model group than in SCI-7D group (P<0.05). As compared with SCI model groups, KCC2 protein in rTMS groups was up-regulated after the treatment (P<0.05). The up-regulation of KCC2 protein content and expression was more obvious in SCI-7D rTMS group than in SCI-14D rTMS group (P<0.05). It was concluded that 10 Hz rTMS can alleviate spasticity in rats with SCI, which might be attributed to the up-regulation of KCC2 protein. It was also suggested that the high-frequency rTMS treatment after SCI at early stage might achieve more satisfactory curative effectiveness.","potassium_chloride","pubmed"

We then performed immunohistochemical and western blot analyses to examine the expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and phosphorylation of the KCC2 serine residue, 940 (S940), since this is the main chloride extruder that affects neuronal excitability. We also performed immunohistochemical analyses on the number of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1)-positive boutons to count the number of Ia afferent fibers that connect to motoneurons. Western bolts revealed that, compared with sham mice, experimental mice had significantly reduced KCC2 expression at 7 d post-stroke, and dephosphorylated S940 at 3 and 7 d post-stroke in motoneuron plasma membranes. We also observed a lower density of KCC2-positive areas in the plasma membrane of motoneurons at 3 and 7 d post-stroke. However, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that there were no differences between groups 21 and 42 d post-stroke, respectively. In addition, at 7 and 42 d post-stroke, experimental mice exhibited a significant increase in vGluT1 boutons compared with sham mice.

However, the mechanisms by which exercise regulates activity in spinal pathways to reduce spasticity and improve functional recovery are poorly understood. Persisting alterations in the action of GABA on postsynaptic targets is a signature of CNS injuries, including SCI. The action of GABA depends on the intracellular chloride concentration, which is determined largely by the expression of two cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), KCC2 and NKCC1, which serve as chloride exporters and importers, respectively. We hypothesized that the reduction in hyperreflexia with exercise after SCI relies on a return to chloride homeostasis. Sprague Dawley rats received a spinal cord transection at T12 and were assigned to SCI-7d, SCI-14d, SCI-14d+exercise, SCI-28d, SCI-28d+exercise, or SCI-56d groups. During a terminal experiment, H-reflexes were recorded from interosseus muscles after stimulation of the tibial nerve and the low-frequency-dependent depression (FDD) was assessed. We provide evidence that exercise returns spinal excitability and levels of KCC2 and NKCC1 toward normal levels in the lumbar spinal cord. Acutely altering chloride extrusion using the KCC2 blocker DIOA masked the effect of exercise on FDD, whereas blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide returned FDD toward intact levels after SCI. Our results indicate that exercise contributes to reflex recovery and restoration of endogenous inhibition through a return to chloride homeostasis after SCI. This lends support for CCCs as part of a pathway that could be manipulated to improve functional recovery when combined with rehabilitation programs.","potassium_chloride","pubmed"

Inclusion was based on the availability of the following tests both before and after alpha1-receptor blockade: renal scan, urodynamic studies, and arterial pressures. Part I evaluated the impact of alpha1-blockers on upper tract stasis. Part II evaluated the impact of alpha1-blockers on urodynamic parameters in those with and without resolution of stasis.

Student's t test for 2-paired samples was used to evaluate whether urodynamic parameters differed significantly before and after treatment with alpha1-blockers. Urodynamic parameters evaluated included mean changes in opening pressure, maximum detrusor voiding pressure, and duration of uninhibited contraction. Ten men with upper tract stasis were identified (15 renal units). After >6 months on alpha1-receptor antagonist therapy, upper tract stasis resolved in 8 of the 10 men (11 renal units) and persisted in 2 men (4 renal units). (P = .00026). The only urodynamic parameter that significantly changed in those with resolution of upper tract stasis was the duration of the uninhibited contraction (resolution of stasis: -57 seconds; P < .001), persistence of stasis: +12 seconds (P < .05). No significant change in opening pressures occurred in either those with resolution of stasis or persistent stasis (P < .78). Maximum arterial pressures during voiding statistically decreased with the use of alpha1-blockers (152 mmHg vs 135 mmHg; P < .01). alpha1-Receptor-antagonist therapy improved upper tract stasis in men with SCI.

However, side effects combined with a limited efficacy in clinical trials have restricted their usefulness for treatment of SCI patients. Recent studies have shown that incorporation of the nitric oxide releasing moiety into the glucocorticoid structure enhances anti-inflammatory properties and reduces side effects. One compound, a derivative of prednisolone (PRE), (NCX 1015, prednisolone 21 [(4'nitrooxymethyl)benzoate]), has interesting pharmacological properties. Therefore, we investigated its effects on apoptosis and recovery of function in rats after SCI. Rats received subcutaneously vehicle, NCX 1015 or PRE (37 micromol/kg, each) 3.5 h after a standardized thoracic lesion. The treatment was continued once a day for 3 days and the effect of both steroids on apoptosis was examined by immunohistochemistry 24 h after the last injection. NCX 1015 but not PRE reduced TUNEL and activated caspase 3 in both white and ventral gray matter as well as tumor necrosis factor immunoreactivity in ventral horn motorneurons, suggesting that NCX 1015 reduces SCI-induced apoptosis. The effect of NCX 1015 on motor function was then examined by a standard locomotion rating scale (BBB) starting at 1 day after injury and continuing up to 14 days. NCX 1015 improved significantly locomotor activity by 4 days after injury, whereas PRE had an effect equivalent to that of vehicle, thus providing a correlation between the antiapoptotic effect of NCX1015 and its ability to improve recovery of function. The data suggest that NCX 1015 might be a novel experimental therapeutic compound for recovery of function in SCI patients.","prednisolone","pubmed"

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacological agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger vitamin E (i.e., alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurological recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for treatment of acute neural injury. The glucocorticoid steroid, methyl-prednisolone (MP), has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant doses, improves chronic neurological recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of MP is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions, as evidenced by the efficacy of the novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids, which are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than MP. One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently the subject of phase II clinical trials. Recently, compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-amino-steroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) also have shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds further supports the concept that LP is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacological neuroprotection.","prednisolone","pubmed"

A growing body of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological evidence has suggested that oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, working in concert with aberrant calcium fluxes and eicosanoid generation in particular, plays a key role in progressive post-traumatic spinal cord degeneration. Of particular importance, lipid peroxidation has been linked to microvascular damage and hypoperfusion which, if severe enough, can lead to a secondary ischemic insult to the tissue. The ability of intensive dosing with the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone to beneficially affect post-traumatic ischemia and to promote chronic neurologic recovery in spinal cord injured animals has been correlated not with its glucocorticoid activity, but rather with the ability to inhibit post-traumatic spinal lipid peroxidation. In view of this, a novel series of non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroids has been developed which lack glucocorticoid activity but are more effective inhibitors of nervous tissue lipid peroxidation than the glucocorticoid steroids. One of these, U74006F, has now been studied in some detail and appears to be a promising new agent for the acute treatment of spinal cord (and brain) trauma.

To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 ± 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes.

Suppression of microglial activation and improvement in functional recovery was observed in experimental spinal cord injury after PGB administration. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate whether PGB could afford neuroprotection in a rat model of intracisternal facial nerve avulsion. Twenty-eight male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were dichotomized into two groups: a PGB group (N.=14) and a control group (N.=14). The PGB group received a total of 4 intraperitoneal PGB injections (30 mg/kg, 15 minutes preoperatively and 4, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively), and the control group underwent intraperitoneal saline injection. Intracisternal facial nerve avulsion was created by tangential pull-out of the nerve surgically exposed at the stylomastoid foramen. In both groups, the brainstem containing the facial motor nuclei neurons was thin-sliced and stained with cresyl violet, and the number of viable neurons in the facial motor nuclei on days 14 and 28 was counted under microscope. The total viable neuron count was significantly greater in the PGB group than in the Control group both on day 14 (271.4±14.9 vs. 196.2±22.2, P<0.01) and day 28 (160.2±21.6 vs. 102.6±13.4, P<0.01). Furthermore, CD11b/c immunostaining on days 3 and 8 showed that CD11b/c-positive cells, suggestive of activated microglia, were observed only in the control group. Better neuronal survival by PGB administration may be beneficial and clinically relevant when surgical reconstruction of the facial nerve, such as hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, is considered.","pregabalin","pubmed"

Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four groups; the control group (contusion injury only), the methylprednisolone treated group, the minocycline treated group and the GP treated group. Spinal cord injury was produced by contusion using the New York University impactor (25 g-cm, at the 9th-10th thoracic). Functional evaluations were done using the inclined plane test and a motor rating scale. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling staining technique (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining of cord tissues obtained at 7 days post-injury. Pregabalin treated animals showed significantly better functional recovery, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Mean numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the respective groups were 63.5 +/- 7.4, 53.6 +/- 4.0, 44.2 +/- 3.9 and 36.5 +/- 3.6. Double staining (TUNEL and anti-CC1) for oligodendrocyte apoptosis, was used to calculate oligodendrocyte apoptotic indexes (AI), using the following formula AI = (No. of doubly stained cells/No. of anti-CC1 positive cells) x 100.

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death.","probenecid","pubmed"

The objective of this study was to evaluate randomized clinical trials that address potential neuroprotective agents used to improve neurological outcome in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations.","progesterone","pubmed"

Two-photon intravital imaging combined with a simplified imaging window chamber were used to image axons in hemisected spinal cords over a period of 3 days.

Past experimental and clinical research aimed at addressing this subject has led to constrasting findings on whether females hold any advantage in locomotor recovery. Additionally, for studies supporting the notion of a female gender related advantage, a definite cause has not been explained. In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance: age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male. By deepening our understanding of why a gender advantage exists, potential new therapeutics can be designed to improve recovery for the male population following the initial trauma or putatively augment the neuroprotective privilege in females for enhanced outcomes.","progesterone","pubmed"

Evidence suggests that inflammation plays a role in both the damage and repair of injured neural tissue. We show that microglia at sites of SCI rapidly express the alarmin interleukin (IL)-1α, and that infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages subsequently produce IL-1β. Infiltration of these cells is dramatically reduced in both IL-1α(-/-) and IL-1β(-/-) mice, but only IL-1α(-/-) mice showed rapid (at day 1) and persistent improvements in locomotion associated with reduced lesion volume. Similarly, intrathecal administration of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra restored locomotor function post-SCI. Transcriptome analysis of SCI tissue at day 1 identified the survival factor Tox3 as being differentially regulated exclusively in IL-1α(-/-) mice compared with IL-1β(-/-) and wild-type mice. Accordingly, IL-1α(-/-) mice have markedly increased Tox3 levels in their oligodendrocytes, beginning at postnatal day 10 (P10) and persisting through adulthood. At P10, the spinal cord of IL-1α(-/-) mice showed a transient increase in mature oligodendrocyte numbers, coinciding with increased IL-1α expression in wild-type animals. In adult mice, IL-1α deletion is accompanied by increased oligodendrocyte survival after SCI. TOX3 overexpression in human oligodendrocytes reduced cellular death under conditions mimicking SCI. These results suggest that IL-1α-mediated Tox3 suppression during the early phase of CNS insult plays a crucial role in secondary degeneration. The mechanisms underlying bystander degeneration of neurons and oligodendrocytes after CNS injury are ill defined. We show that microglia at sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) rapidly produce the danger signal interleukin (IL)-1α, which triggers neuroinflammation and locomotor defects. We uncovered that IL-1α(-/-) mice have markedly increased levels of the survival factor Tox3 in their oligodendrocytes, which correlates with the protection of this cell population, and reduced lesion volume, resulting in unprecedented speed, level, and persistence of functional recovery after SCI. Our data suggest that central inhibition of IL-1α or Tox3 overexpression during the acute phase of a CNS insult may be an effective means for preventing the loss of neurological function in SCI, or other acute injuries such as ischemia and traumatic brain injuries.","progesterone","pubmed"

In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females.

In peripheral neuropathies, progesterone and reduced derivatives promote remyelination, axonal regeneration and the recovery of function. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), progesterone has the ability to reduce edema and inflammatory cytokines, prevent neuronal loss and improve functional outcomes. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury. In experimental spinal cord injury (SCI), molecular markers of functional motoneurons become impaired, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, Na,K-ATPase mRNA, microtubule-associated protein 2 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). SCI also produces motoneuron chromatolysis. Progesterone treatment restores the expression of these molecules while chromatolysis subsided. SCI also causes oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination. In this case, a short progesterone treatment enhances proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into mature myelin-producing cells, whereas prolonged treatment increases a transcription factor (Olig1) needed to repair injury-induced demyelination. Progesterone neuroprotection has also been shown in motoneuron neurodegeneration. In Wobbler mice spinal cord, progesterone reverses the impaired expression of BDNF, ChAT and Na,K-ATPase, prevents vacuolar motoneuron degeneration and the development of mitochondrial abnormalities, while functionally increases muscle strength and the survival of Wobbler mice. Multiple mechanisms contribute to these progesterone effects, and the role played by classical nuclear receptors, extra nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, and the reduced metabolites of progesterone in neuroprotection and myelin formation remain an exciting field worth of exploration.","progesterone","pubmed"

We now know that it is produced in the brain, for the brain, by neurons and glial cells in the central and peripheral nervous system of both male and female individuals. Laboratories around the world have reported that administering relatively large doses of progesterone during the first few hours to days after injury significantly limits central nervous system damage, reduces loss of neural tissue, and improves functional recovery. Although the research published to date has focused primarily on progesterone's effects on blunt traumatic brain injury, there is evidence that the hormone affords protection from several forms of acute central nervous system injury, including penetrating brain trauma, stroke, anoxic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Progesterone appears to exert its protective effects by protecting or rebuilding the blood-brain barrier, decreasing development of cerebral edema, down-regulating the inflammatory cascade, and limiting cellular necrosis and apoptosis.

Both neurons and glial cells expressed the classical PROG receptor (PR), suggesting that genomic mechanisms participated in PROG action. In TRX rats, PROG treatment stimulated the number of NADPH-diaphorase (nitric oxide synthase) active astrocytes, whereas the number of astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was stimulated in control but not in TRX rats. PROG also stimulated the immunocytochemical staining for myelin-basic protein (MBP) and the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells expressing the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 in TRX rats.

To investigate for a similar role in neurodegeneration, we studied progesterone effects in the Wobbler mouse, a mutant presenting severe motoneuron degeneration and astrogliosis of the spinal cord. Implant of a single progesterone pellet (20 mg) during 15 days produced substantial changes in Wobbler mice spinal cord. Morphologically, motoneurons of untreated Wobbler mice showed severe vacuolation of intracellular organelles including mitochondria. In contrast, neuropathology was less pronounced in Wobbler mice receiving progesterone, together with a reduction of vacuolated cells and preservation of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Determination of mRNAs for the alpha 3 and beta 1 subunits of neuronal Na, K-ATPase, showed that mRNA levels in untreated mice were significantly reduced, whereas progesterone therapy re-established the expression of both subunits. Additionally, progesterone treatment of Wobbler mice attenuated the aberrant expression of the growth-associated protein (GAP-43) mRNA which otherwise occurred in motoneurons of untreated animals. The hormone, however, was without effect on astrocytosis of Wobbler mice, determined by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunostaining. Lastly, progesterone treatment of Wobbler mice enhanced grip strength and prolonged survival at the end of the 15-day observation period. Recovery of morphology and molecular motoneuron parameters of Wobbler mice receiving progesterone, suggest a new and important role for this hormone in the prevention of spinal cord neurodegenerative disorders.","progesterone","pubmed"

In the present work, we examine PROG effects on three measures of neuronal function under negative regulation (choline acetyltransferase [ChAT] and Na,K-ATPase) or stimulated (growth-associated protein [GAP-43]) after acute spinal cord transection injury in rats. As expected, spinal cord injury reduced ChAT immunostaining intensity of ventral horn neurons. A 3-day course of intensive PROG treatment of transected rats restored ChAT immunoreactivity, as assessed by frequency histograms that recorded shifts from predominantly light neuronal staining to medium, dark or intense staining typical of control rats. Transection also reduced the expression of the mRNA for the alpha3 catalytic and beta1 regulatory subunits of neuronal Na,K-ATPase, whereas PROG treatment restored both subunit mRNA to normal levels. Additionally, the upregulation observed for GAP-43 mRNA in ventral horn neurons in spinal cord-transected rats, was further enhanced by PROG administration. In no case did PROG modify ChAT immunoreactivity, Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNA or GAP-43 mRNA in control, sham-operated rats. Further, the PROG-mediated effects on these three markers were observed in large, presumably Lamina IX motoneurons, as well as in smaller neurons measuring approximately <500 micro2. Overall, the stimulatory effects of PROG on ChAT appears to replenish acetylcholine, with its stimulatory effects on Na,K-ATPase seems capable of restoring membrane potential, ion transport and nutrient uptake. PROG effects on GAP-43 also appear to accelerate reparative responses to injury. As the cellular basis for PROG neuroprotection becomes better understood it may prove of therapeutic benefit to spinal cord injury patients.","progesterone","pubmed"

Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment. This first decade of the new millennium, now touted as the Decade of the Spine, will hopefully witness the emergence of universal and efficacious pharmacologic therapy and ultimately a cure for SCI.","progesterone","pubmed"

Progesterone is a neurosteroid, possessing a variety of functions in the central nervous system. Exogenous progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic function after focal cerebral ischemia and facilitates cognitive recovery after cortical contusion in rats. A standardized rat contusion model of spinal cord injury using the New York University impactor that resulted in rats with incomplete paraplegia was used. Forty mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: laminectomy with sham contusion, laminectomy with contusion without pharmacologic treatment, laminectomy with contusion treated with dimethylsulfoxide and dissolved progesterone, and laminectomy with contusion treated with dimethylsulfoxide. Functional status was assessed weekly using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan (BBB) locomotor rating scale for 6 weeks, after which the animals were killed for histologic studies. Rats treated with progesterone had better outcomes (P = 0.0017; P = 0.0172) with a BBB score of 15.5, compared with 10.0 in the dimethylsulfoxide control group and 12.0 in the spinal cord contusion without pharmacologic intervention group. This was corroborated in histologic analysis by relative sparing of white matter tissue at the epicenter of the injury in the progesterone-treated group (P < 0.05). Rats treated with progesterone had a better clinical and histologic outcome compared with the various control groups.

An interesting hypothesis is that the general anaesthetic itself might largely contribute to neuroprotection, although in vivo clinical settings hamper studying this possibility directly. To further test neuroprotective effects of a widely used general anaesthetic, we studied if propofol could change the outcome of a rat isolated spinal cord SCI model involving excitotoxicity evoked by 1 h application of kainate with delayed consequences on neurons and locomotor network activity. Propofol (5 μm; 4-8 h) enhanced responses to GABA and depressed those to NMDA together with decrease in polysynaptic reflexes that partly recovered after 1 day washout. Fictive locomotion induced by dorsal root stimuli or NMDA and serotonin was weaker the day after propofol application. Kainate elicited a significant loss of spinal neurons, especially motoneurons, whose number was halved. When propofol was applied for 4-8 h after kainate washout, strong neuroprotection was observed in all spinal areas, including attenuation of motoneuron loss. Although propofol had minimal impact on recovery of electrophysiological characteristics 24 h later, it did not further depress network activity. A significant improvement in disinhibited burst periodicity suggested potential to ameliorate neuronal excitability in analogy to histological data. Functional recovery of locomotor networks perhaps required longer time due to the combined action of excitotoxicity and anaesthetic depression at 24 h. These results suggest propofol could confer good neuroprotection to spinal circuits during experimental SCI.","propofol","pubmed"

Devising an efficacious protocol of neuroprotection to arrest excitotoxicity might, therefore, spare a substantial number of neurons and allow later recovery. In vitro preparations of the spinal cord enable detailed measurement of spinal damage evoked by the potent glutamate analogue kainate. Any clinically-relevant neuroprotective treatment should start after the initial lesion and spare networks for at least 24h when cell damage plateaus. Using this strategy, we have observed that the gas anesthetic methoxyflurane provided strong, delayed neuroprotection. It is unclear if this beneficial effect was due to the mechanism of action by methoxyflurane, or it was the consequence of anesthetic depression. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect by propofol (commonly injected i.v. for general anesthesia) after kainate excitotoxicity induced on organotypic spinal slices. At 5μM concentration, propofol significantly attenuated cell death, including neuronal losses and, especially, damage to the highly vulnerable motoneurons. The action by propofol was fully prevented when co-applied with the GABAA antagonist bicuculline, indicating that neuroprotection required intact GABAA receptor function. Although bicuculline per se was not neurotoxic, it largely enhanced the lesional effects of kainate, suggesting that GABAA receptor activity could limit excitotoxicity. Our data might offer an explanation for the beneficial clinical outcome of neurosurgery performed as soon as possible after spinal lesion: we posit that general anesthesia contributes to this outcome, regardless of the type of anesthetic used.","propofol","pubmed"

Injury activates the stress systems; this in turn may augment the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulate pro-inflammatory immune cells, and alter the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response. As a result, it is suggested that stress pathways may augment neuronal damage and loss after SCI. Considering these potential detrimental effects of stress after SCI, we hypothesized that inhibition of stress pathways immediately after SCI may offer protection from damage and improve recovery. To investigate the relevance of stress responses in SCI recovery, we investigated the effects of blocking three well-studied stress response axes in a mouse model of SCI. Propranolol, RU-486, and CP-99994 were administered to inhibit the sympathetic axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the neuropeptide axis, respectively. Surprisingly, assessing functional recovery by the Basso Mouse Scale revealed that RU-486 and CP-99994 did not affect functional outcome, indicating that these pathways are dispensable for neuroprotection or repair after SCI. Moreover, the beta-blocker propranolol worsened functional outcome in the mouse SCI model. In conclusion, immediate inhibition of three major stress axes has no beneficial effects on functional recovery after SCI in mice. These results suggest that injury-induced stress responses do not interfere with the healing process and hence, pharmacological targeting of stress responses is not a recommended treatment option for SCI. These findings are of great importance for other researchers to avoid unnecessary and potentially futile animal experiments.","propranolol","pubmed"

Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is a newly identified critical target for the anti-inflammatory effect of HNK. Whether HNK can inhibit inflammatory response in rat model of SCI through mediating the expression of Klf4 has yet to be elucidated.

Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury.","red_blood_cells","pubmed"

Recently, there is increasing interest in tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic drug, which can reduce the bleeding volume after physical trauma. However, the efficacy of TXA on the pathology of SCI remains unknown. After producing a contusion SCI at the thoracic level of mice, TXA was intraperitoneally administered and the bleeding volume in the lesion area was quantified. Tissue damage was evaluated by immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses. Since heme is one of the degraded products of red blood cells (RBCs) and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), we examined the influence of heme on the pathology of SCI. Functional recovery was assessed using the open field motor score, a foot print analysis, a grid walk test, and a novel kinematic analysis system. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, Dunnett's test, and an ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. After SCI, the intralesional bleeding volume was correlated with the heme content and the demyelinated area at the lesion site, which were significantly reduced by the administration of TXA. In the injured spinal cord, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is a DAMP receptor, was predominantly expressed in microglial cells. Heme stimulation increased TLR4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression levels in primary microglial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly to the in vitro experiments, the injection of non-lysed RBCs had little pathological influence on the spinal cord, whereas the injection of lysed RBCs or heme solution significantly upregulated the TLR4 and TNF expression in microglial cells. In TXA-treated SCI mice, the decreased expressions of TLR4 and TNF were observed at the lesion sites, accompanied by a significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells and better functional recovery in comparison to saline-treated control mice. The administration of TXA ameliorated the intralesional cytotoxicity both by reducing the intralesional bleeding volume and preventing heme induction of the TLR4/TNF axis in the SCI lesion. Our findings suggest that TXA treatment may be a therapeutic option for acute-phase SCI.","red_blood_cells","pubmed"

Selenium-doped carbon quantum dots (Se-CQDs) with the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species were prepared and used for efficiently ameliorating secondary injury in TSCI. Water-soluble Se-CQDs were easily synthesized via hydrothermal treatment of l-selenocystine. The chemical structure, size, and morphology of the Se-CQDs were characterized in detail. The biocompatibility and protective effects of the Se-CQDs against H2O2-induced oxidative damage were investigated in vitro. Moreover, the behavioral test, bladder function, histological observation, Western blot were used to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Se-CQDs in a rat model of contusion TSCI. The obtained Se-CQDs exhibited good biocompatibility and remarkable protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in astrocytes and PC12 cells. Moreover, Se-CQDs displayed marked anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, which thereby reduced the formation of glial scars and increased the survival of neurons with unscathed myelin sheaths in vivo. As a result, Se-CQDs were capable of largely improving locomotor function of rats with TSCI. This study suggests that Se-CQDs can be used as a promising therapeutic platform for ameliorating secondary injury in TSCI.","selenium","pubmed"

It appears to contribute to the death of tumors, ischemia-reperfusion, acute renal failure, and nervous system diseases, among others. The generative mechanism of ferroptosis includes iron overloading, lipid peroxidation, and downstream execution, while the regulatory mechanism involves the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, as well as the mevalonate pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. In-depth research has continuously developed and enriched knowledge on the mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs. In recent years, reports of the noninterchangeable role played by selenium in glutathione peroxidase 4 and its function in suppressing ferroptosis and the discovery of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, identified as a ferroptosis resistance factor parallel to the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, have expanded and deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which ferroptosis works. Ferroptosis has been reported in spinal cord injury animal model experiments, and the inhibition of ferroptosis could promote the recovery of neurological function. Here, we review the latest studies on mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs, focusing on the ferroptosis execution and the contents related to selenium and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. In addition, we summarize the current research status of ferroptosis in spinal cord injury. The aim of this review is to better understand the mechanisms by which ferroptosis occurs and its role in the pathophysiological process of spinal cord injury, so as to provide a new idea and frame of reference for further exploration.","selenium","pubmed"

Among the complex pathophysiological events following SCI, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction plays a particularly significant role. As therapeutic agents for neurological diseases, tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) have been widely used in the clinical treatment of SCI. Our previous studies have reported that functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) exhibit excellent antioxidant activity against oxidative stress-related diseases. Therefore, in this study, novel multifunctionalized SeNPs decorated with polysaccharide-protein complex (PTW)/PG-6 peptide and loaded with TMP/GM1 were rationally designed and synthesized, which exhibited a satisfactory size distribution and superior stability. Furthermore, the protective effects of SeNPs@GM1/TMP on PC12 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH)-induced cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms were also explored. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that SeNPs@GM1/TMP showed strongly protective effects against t-BOOH-induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we found that SeNPs@GM1/TMP could attenuate ROS overproduction to prevent mitochondria dysfunction via inhibiting the activation of p53 and MAPK pathways. Effects of SeNPs@GM1/TMP on functional recovery after SCI were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, inclined plane test, and footprint analysis. The results of hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining also showed that SeNPs@GM1/TMP provided a neuroprotective effect in SCI rats. This finding suggests that SeNPs@GM1/TMP could be further developed as a promising nanomedicine for efficient SCI treatment.","selenium","pubmed"

Serum samples were available from different time points (upon admission, and after 4, 9 and 12 h, 1 and 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months). Serum trace element concentrations were determined by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, SELENOP by ELISA, and further parameters by laboratory routine. Serum Se and SELENOP concentrations were higher on admission in the remission group (G1) as compared to G0.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of ebselen on mitochondrial oxidative stress response, mitochondrial apotosis, and motor behaviors after spinal cord injury (SCI). We found that ebselen significantly increased the BBB score in motor behavior, thus suggesting a rescue effect of ebselen on motor function after SCI in rats. Meanwhile, we revealed that ebselen can increase glutathione (GSH) content as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities after SCI-this suggests ebselen has an antioxidant effect. Furthermore, the ATP content and Na+-K+-ATPase activity in mitochondria were increased by ebselen after SCI, while the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was decreased by ebselen. The Cytochrome C and Smac release from mitochondria were reduced by ebselen after SCI, thus indicating improved membrane permeability by ebselen. Moreover, the alterations in caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression, as well as the proportion of cell apoptosis were improved by ebselen treatment, which together suggested that ebselen has an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial apotosis pathways after SCI. Taken together, our results suggest that ebselen can inhibit secondary damage caused by spinal cord injury. Indeed it plays a neuroprotective role in spinal cord injury perhaps by improving mitochondrial function and inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.","selenium","pubmed"

In order to explore the protective effect of selenium-enriched supplement (SES) on SCI, the adult rats were randomly divided into sham operation control (SC) group, ischemia-reperfusion model (IM) group and SES pretreatment (ST) group to investigate the change of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and its receptor-alpha (CNTF-Ralpha) during SCI in the presence of SES. The rats in IM and ST groups were subjected to the blockage of their abdominal aorta to establish the model of SCI; but the rats in SC group were subjected to sham operation without the blockage of abdominal aorta. The rats in ST group were fed with foods containing SES at the dose of equivalent 5 mg/L selenium in water before blocking their abdominal aorta. After 7 days, the rats were sacrificed to observe the structure of nerve cells through HE staining and the expression of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha by Western blot, immunohistochemical, and RT-PCR methods, respectively. Both protein and mRNA of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha were positively expressed in rats from SC group. The mRNA expression levels of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha in ST group were much higher than SCI model group.

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model.

These inflammatory responses spread the damage to the neural cells and impair the recovery of neurological functions. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin and a simvastatin-ezetimibe combination therapy in managing the endothelial inflammatory response in an SCI rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were group-housed and SCI was induced by using the modified weight-drop method. The animals were divided into 4 groups: (1) sham group, laminectomy only (n=6); (2) no-treatment group, SCI without therapy (n=8); (3) simvastatin group (n=8), and (4) ezetimibe and simvastatin combination therapy group (n=8). A high dose (15 mg/kg) of simvastatin was given to the simvastatin group, and 10 mg/kg simvastatin and 10 mg/kg ezetimibe were given to the combination group. Neurological function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale score. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level was used as an SCI biomarker. ICAM-1 level was the highest at 72 hours after SCI in the no-treament group. The treatment groups showed significant reduction in ICAM-1 levels at 72 hours. The treatment groups, especially the combination treatment group, showed better neurological function scores. Simvastatin and simvastatin- ezetimibe all could improve the neurological function and attenuate the endothelial inflammatory response after spinal cord injury in rat.","simvastatin","pubmed"

However, the molecular mechanism underlying these effects remains unknown. This study demonstrates that the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin (Simv) exhibits neuroprotective effects on neuronal apoptosis and supports functional recovery in a rat SCI model by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In specific, Simv administration after SCI significantly up-regulated the expression of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 phosphorylation and β-catenin protein, increased the mRNA expression of lymphoid enhancer factor-1 and T-cell factor-1, and suppressed the expression of β-catenin phosphorylation in the spinal cord neurons. Simv enhanced motor neuronal survival in the spinal cord anterior horn and decreased the lesion of spinal cord tissues after SCI. Simv administration after SCI also evidently reduced the expression levels of Bax, active caspase-3, and active caspase-9 in the spinal cord neurons and the proportion of transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive neuron cells, but increased the expression level of Bcl-2 in the spinal cord neurons. However, the anti-apoptotic effects of Simv were reduced in cultured spinal cord nerve cells when the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed in the lipopolysaccharide-induced model. Furthermore, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores indicated that Simv treatment significantly improved the locomotor functions of rats after SCI. This study is the first to report that Simv exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuronal apoptosis, and promoting functional and pathological recovery after SCI by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We verified the neuroprotective properties associated with simvastatin following spinal cord injury (SCI). Simvastatin reduced neuronal apoptosis, improved the functional and pathological recovery via activating Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway, however, the anti-apoptosis effects of simvastatin were reversed following suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in primary spinal cord neurons. The significant findings may provide clinical therapeutic value of simvastatin for treating SCI.","simvastatin","pubmed"

Green fluorescence protein labeled-bone marrow stromal cells (GFP-BMSCs) were transplanted into rats through the tail vein for stem cell tracing. Twenty-four hours after transplantation, spinal cord injury (SCI) was produced using weight-drop method (10g 4cm) at the T10 level. Simvastatin (5mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by subarachnoid injection at lumbar level 4 after SCI. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed in the 4 weeks following surgery using the open-field test and inclined-plane test. At the end of the study, MRI was used to evaluate the reparation of the injured spinal cord. Animals were then euthanized, histological evaluation was used to measure lesion cavity volumes. Immunofluorescence for GFP and cell lineage markers (NeuN and GFAP) was used to evaluate simvastatin-mediated mobilization and differentiation of transplanted BMSCs. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor recovery, less signal abnormality in MRI and a smaller cavity volume compared to the control group. Immunofluorescence revealed that simvastatin increased the number of GFP-positive cells in the injured spinal cord, and the number of cells double positive for GFP/NeuN or GFP/GFAP was larger in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed higher expression of BDNF and VEGF in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. In conclusion, simvastatin can help to repair spinal cord injury in rat, where the underlying mechanism appears to involve the mobilization of bone marrow stromal cells to the injured area and higher expression of BNDF and VEGF.","simvastatin","pubmed"

These drugs are also known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, improve endothelial function, and modulate the immune system in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and SCI. As both drugs have translational potential, we evaluated their neuroprotective properties here in a clinically relevant model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury.

Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days then 5mg/kg x 35 days, or 4. Saline (Control). Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, modified Montoya staircase test and grooming test. Forepaw sensitivity was also assessed using the electronic von Frey Aesthesiometer. The corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts were traced and the spinal cords were harvested 7 weeks after injury. The extent of gray matter and white matter sparing and corticospinal and rubrospinal tract sprouting were evaluated in cross sections of the spinal cord. In the end, neither minocycline nor simvastatin treatment was associated with improved performance on the behavioral tests, as compared to saline controls. Performance on the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, and von Frey sensory test were similar among all groups. Animals treated for 42 days with simvastatin scored significantly higher in the grooming score compared to other groups, but retrieved significantly fewer pellets on the modified Montoya staircase test than control and minocycline treated animals. Histologically, there were no significant differences in white and gray matter sparing and in the extent of corticospinal and rubrospinal sprouting between the four groups.

In this study, we tested whether simvastatin improves bladder and renal functions in a rat model of experimental SCI. SCI was induced by controlled contusion of T9-T10 in adult female rats. Simvastatin (5 mg/Kg body weight) was administered at two hours after SCI and repeated every 24 hours until the end point. Simvastatin-treated SCI animals (simvastatin group) were compared with vehicle-treated SCI animals (vehicle group) in terms of the Basso Beattie Bresnahan score, tissue morphology, cell death, and bladder/renal functions. The urinary bladder of vehicle animals showed a 4.3-fold increase in size and a 9-fold increase in wet weight compared to sham animals. Following SCI, the urine to plasma osmolality ratio increased initially but decreased 1 week after SCI. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of bladder tissue showed transitional epithelial hyperplasia, degeneration of lamina propria, and enlargement of tunica adventia in addition to detrusor muscle hypertrophy. Rats treated with simvastatin for 14 days displayed remarkable recovery by showing decreased bladder size and maintenance of a normal urine/plasma osmolality ratio, in addition to improved locomotion. The muscularis layer of the bladder also regained its compact nature in simvastatin animals. Moreover, SCI-induced renal caspase-3 activity was significantly decreased in the simvastatin group indicating the ability of simvastatin to reduce the renal tubular apoptosis. Post-injury administration of simvastatin ameliorates bladder and renal dysfunction associated with SCI in rats.","simvastatin","pubmed"

CSPG levels decreased by up to 45% in simvastatin-treated astrocyte cultures compared to control cultures.

Attenuation of astrocyte activation may contribute to the decline in CSPG levels. However, there are likely other contributing factors, since GFAP levels were not a contributing factor in the decline of CSPG levels in astrocyte cultures.

Growing evidences have reported stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signalling axis provides neuroprotection in experimental models of neurodegeneration disease. Endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4), resulting in blocking of GLP-1/GLP1R signalling process. Sitagliptin, a highly selective inhibitor of DPP4, has approved to have beneficial effects on diseases in which neurons damaged. However, the roles and the underlying mechanisms of sitagliptin in SCI repairing remain unclear. In this study, we used a rat model of SCI and PC12 cells/primary cortical neurons to explore the mechanism of sitagliptin underlying SCI recovery. We discovered the expression of GLP-1R decreased in the SCI model. Administration of sitagliptin significantly increased GLP-1R protein level, alleviated neuronal apoptosis, enhanced axon regeneration and improved functional recovery following SCI. Nevertheless, treatment with exendin9-39, a GLP-1R inhibitor, remarkably reversed the protective effect of sitagliptin. Additionally, we detected the AMPK/PGC-1α signalling pathway was activated by sitagliptin stimulating GLP-1R.

To date, systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) have shown promise in SCI. However, systemic immunosuppression can have detrimental side effects. Therefore, immunomodulatory approaches including the use of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) could represent an attractive alternative. While emerging preclinical data suggests that hIgG is neuroprotective after SCI, the optimal time window of administration and the mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. These knowledge gaps were the focus of this research study. Female adult Wistar rats received a clip compression-contusion SCI at the C7/T1 level of the spinal cord. Injured rats were randomized, in a blinded manner, to receive a single intravenous bolus of hIgG (2 g/kg) or control buffer at 15 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) or 4 h post-SCI. At 24 h and 8 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological and neurobehavioral analyses were undertaken. At all 3 administration time points, hIgG (2 g/kg) resulted in significantly better short-term and long-term outcomes as compared to control buffer. No significant differences were observed when comparing outcomes between the different time points of administration. At 24 h post-injury, hIgG (2 g/kg) administration enhanced the integrity of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) by increasing expression of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in BSCB integrity were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, lower amounts of albumin and Evans Blue in the injured spinal cord and greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. After hIgG (2 g/kg) treatment, there were more neutrophils in the spleen and fewer neutrophils in the blood. hIgG also co-localized with endothelial cell ligands that mediate neutrophil extravasation into the injured spinal cord. Importantly, short-term effects of delayed hIgG (2 g/kg) administration were associated with enhanced tissue and neuron preservation, as well as neurobehavioral and sensory recovery at 8 weeks post-SCI. hIgG (2 g/kg) shows promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by hIgG (2 g/kg) in the injured spinal cord might be explained in twofold. First, hIgG might antagonize neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord by co-localizing with endothelial cell ligands that mediate various steps in neutrophil extravasation. Second, hIgG could traffic neutrophils towards the spleen by increasing expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. Overall, we demonstrate that delayed administration of hIgG (2 g/kg) at 1 and 4-h post-injury enhances short-term and long-term benefits after SCI by modulating local and systemic neuroinflammatory cascades.","sodium","pubmed"

Protection of both the function and integrity of endothelial cells as well as the prevention of BSCB disruption may be a strong strategy for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) cases. Sodium Tanshinone IIA silate (STS) is used for the treatment of coronary heart disease and improves microcirculation. Whether STS exhibits protective effects for SCI microcirculation is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects of STS on oxygen-glucose deprivation- (OGD-) induced injury of spinal cord endothelial cells (SCMECs) in vitro and to explore effects on BSCB and neurovascular protection in vivo. SCMECs were treated with various concentrations of STS (1 μM, 3 μM, and 10 μM) for 24 h with or without OGD-induction. Cell viability, tube formation, migration, and expression of Notch signaling pathway components were evaluated. Histopathological evaluation (H&E), Nissl staining, BSCB permeability, and the expression levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), CD31, NeuN, and Notch signaling pathway components were analyzed. STS was found to improve SCMEC functions and reduce inflammatory mediators after OGD. STS also relieved histopathological damage, increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), inhibited BSCB permeability, rescued microvessels, protected motor neuromas, and improved functional recovery in a SCI model. Moreover, we uncovered that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role during these processes. These results indicated that STS protects microcirculation in SCI, which may be used as a therapeutic strategy for SCI in the future.","sodium","pubmed"

Differentially expressed genes treated with SAAS were screened by transcriptome sequencing, and the molecular mechanism was investigated simultaneously. The results revealed that SAAS could promote type M2 polarization of microglia and reduce the proportion of type M1. In this way, it reduced the secretion and expression of inflammatory factors. Compared with Lipopolysaccharides(LPS), 345 genes were upregulated and 407 genes were downregulated in the LPS + SAAS treatment group. In the SAAS group, expression levels of Ndufa12, IL-6, TNF-α, and Vdac1 were significantly reduced, while a marked elevation was found in MIP2. In addition, results found in an animal model showed that SAAS could obviously facilitate motor function recovery of mice after spinal cord injury, and it had a good protective effect on spinal cord tissue and neuron cells. As a result, the present study clarified both the protective effect of SAAS on neurons after spinal cord injury and the anti-inflammatory effect of microglia, which is expected to serve as a theoretical basis for clinical treatment.","sodium","pubmed"

In conclusion, our results demonstrated that SP possesses neuroprotective effects, suggesting it could represent a target for therapeutic intervention in neuroinflammatory disorders.","sodium","pubmed"

Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPCs) transplantation provides therapeutic benefits for neural repair in SCI, and glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been uncovered to have capability of stimulating axonal regeneration and remyelination after SCI. In this study, to evaluate whether GDNF would augment therapeutic effects of NSPCs for SCI, GDNF-encoding or mock adenoviral vector-transduced human NSPCs (GDNF-or Mock-hNSPCs) were transplanted into the injured thoracic spinal cords of rats at 7 days after SCI. Grafted GDNFhNSPCs showed robust engraftment, long-term survival, an extensive distribution, and increased differentiation into neurons and oligodendroglial cells. Compared with Mock-hNSPC- and vehicle-injected groups, transplantation of GDNF-hNSPCs significantly reduced lesion volume and glial scar formation, promoted neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration and myelination, increased Schwann cell migration that contributed to the myelin repair, and improved locomotor recovery. In addition, tract tracing demonstrated that transplantation of GDNF-hNSPCs reduced significantly axonal dieback of the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST), and increased the levels of dCST collaterals, propriospinal neurons (PSNs), and contacts between dCST collaterals and PSNs in the cervical enlargement over that of the controls. Finally grafted GDNF-hNSPCs substantially reversed the increased expression of voltage-gated sodium channels and neuropeptide Y, and elevated expression of GABA in the injured spinal cord, which are involved in the attenuation of neuropathic pain after SCI. These findings suggest that implantation of GDNF-hNSPCs enhances therapeutic efficiency of hNSPCs-based cell therapy for SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

It was hypothesized that inhibition of Eph signaling promotes cellular and behavioral recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: Lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury was performed on wildtype (WT) and EphA6 knockout (KO) mice. EphA6-Fc, Ephrin-A5-Fc fusion proteins, and sodium orthovanadate were used to alter the signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry and tissue explants revealed cellular changes. Rotarod tests demonstrated vestibulomotor function. Outcomes: The EphA6 receptor expression is upregulated following LFP. Uninjured EphA6 KO mice exhibit greater neurite density and clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc causes growth cone collapse in vitro. After LFP, EphA6 KO mice demonstrate longer neurites and decreased neuronal cell death and astrocytosis compared to WT mice. Blocking EphA signaling by soluble EphA6-Fc fusion protein reduces cell death and improves motor function following LFP whereas clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc exacerbates cell death and neurodegeneration. Sodium orthovanadate rescues growth cone collapse in vitro as well as cell death and neurodegeneration in vivo. Conclusions: Eph/Ephrin signaling plays an inhibitory role following TBI. Targeting the Eph signaling pathway with Fc fusion proteins and pharmacological agents can be a novel strategy to counter the damaging effects of TBI.

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects. The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery.

We found that the bFGF-CRS scaffolds had proper mechanical properties for spinal cord regeneration and could slowly release bFGF for up to 6 weeks under the physiological condition. After implantation, the bFGF-CRS scaffolds could reduce microglial activation, promote revascularization, elicit endogenous neurogenesis and promote regrowth of transected axons. The endogenous mature newly born neurons could form synaptic-like connections with each other or with host neurons, including cortex neurons, brainstem neurons and spinal interneurons. The functional nascent neural networks between the lesion area and the host spinal cord were established. It eventually led to hindlimb locomotion recovery.

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases were searched from their inception date to March 2018. Two reviewers independently selected animal studies that evaluated neurological recovery and lesion area following riluzole treatment in SCI rat models, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Pairwise meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and network meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of riluzole on SCI. Ten eligible studies were included. Two studies had high methodological quality. Overall, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in riluzole-treated animals versus controls, and effect sizes showed a gradual increase from the 1st (five studies, n = 104, mean difference = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.11 to 2.37, p = 0.03) to 6th week after treatment (five studies, n = 120, mean difference = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.42, p < 0.0001).

Timely delivery of specialized care has reduced mortality; however, long-term neurological recovery continues to be limited. In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority. Collaborative international efforts have led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for traumatic SCI based on robust evaluation of current evidence.

To test this, tubule formation and angiopoietins expression were assessed in endothelial cells exposed to different concentrations of recombinant neutropil elastase. Then, the expression of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and neutrophil elastase was determined at 3 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in a clinically relevant model of moderate compression (35 g for 5 min at T10) spinal cord injury. A dichotomy between the levels of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 was observed; thus, we utilized a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (sivelestat sodium; 30 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) after spinal cord injury. The expression levels of neutropil elastase and angiopoietin-2 increased, and that of angiopoietin-1 decreased after spinal cord injury in rats. The sivelestat regimen, optimized via a pharmacokinetics study, had potent effects on vascular stabilization by upregulating angiopoietin-1 via the AKT pathway and preventing tight junction protein degradation. Moreover, sivelestat attenuated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after spinal cord injury and hence subsequently alleviated secondary damage observed as a reduction in glial scar formation and the promotion of blood vessel formation and stabilization. As a result, hindlimb locomotor function significantly recovered in the sivelestat-treated animals as determined by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and footprint analyses. Furthermore, sivelestat treatment attenuated neuropathic pain as assessed by responses to von Frey filaments after spinal cord injury. Thus, our result suggests that inhibiting neutropil elastase by administration of sivelestat is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit glial scar and promote functional recovery by upregulating angiopoietin-1 after spinal cord injury.","sodium","pubmed"

MPSS treatment became the standard of care in adults despite a lack of evidence supporting clinical benefit. More recently, new guidelines from neurological surgeon groups recommended no longer using MPSS for ASCI, due to questionable clinical benefit and known complications. However, little information exists in the pediatric population regarding MPSS use in the setting of ASCI. The aim of this paper was to describe steroid use and side effects in patients with ASCI at the authors' Level 1 pediatric trauma center in order to inform other hospitals that may still use this therapy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine adherence in ordering and delivery according to the guideline of the authors' institution and to determine types and frequency of complications. Inclusion criteria included age < 17 years, blunt trauma, physician concern for ASCI, and admission for ≥ 24 hours or treatment with high-dose intravenous MPSS. Exclusion criteria included penetrating trauma, no documentation of ASCI, and incomplete medical records. Charts were reviewed for a predetermined list of complications. RESULTS A total of 602 patient charts were reviewed; 354 patients were included in the study. MPSS was administered in 59 cases. In 34 (57.5%) the order was placed correctly. In 13 (38.2%) of these 34 cases, MPSS was administered according to the recommended timeline protocol. Overall, only 13 (22%) of 59 patients received the therapy according to protocol with regard to accurate ordering and administration. Among the patients with ASCI, 20 (55.6%) of the 36 who received steroids had complications, which was a significantly higher rate than in those who did not receive steroids (8 [24.2%] of 33, p = 0.008). Among the patients without ASCI, 10 (43.5%) of the 23 who received steroids also experienced significantly more complications than patients who did not receive steroids (50 [19.1%] of 262, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS High-dose MPSS for ASCI was not delivered to pediatric patients according to protocol with a high degree of reliability. Patients receiving steroids for pediatric ASCI were significantly more likely to experience complications than patients not receiving steroids.

The α2Na+/K+-ATPase subunit isoform is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, which us the sharp Na+-gradient maintained by the sodium pump necessary for astroglial metabolism. Prolonged ischemia induces an elevation of [Na+]i, decreased ATP levels and intracellular pH owing to anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation. During ischemia, Na+/K+-ATPase-related functions will naturally increase the energy demand of the Na+/K+-ATPase ion pump. However, the role of the α2Na+/K+-ATPase in contusion injury to the spinal cord remains unknown. We used mice heterozygous mice for the loss-of-function disease-mutation G301R in the Atp1a2 gene (α 2+/G301R ) to study the effect of reduced α2Na+/K+-ATPase expression in a moderate contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) model. We found that α 2+/G301R mice display significantly improved functional recovery and decreased lesion volume compared to littermate controls (α 2+/+ ) 7 days after SCI. The protein level of the α1 isoform was significantly increased, in contrast to the α3 isoform that significantly decreased 3 days after SCI in both α 2+/G301R and α 2+/+ mice. The level of the α2 isoform was significantly decreased in α 2+/G301R mice both under naïve conditions and 3 days after SCI compared to α 2+/+ mice. We found no differences in astroglial aquaporin 4 levels and no changes in the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL1) and cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-5) between genotypes, just as no apparent differences were observed in location and activation of CD45 and F4/80 positive microglia and infiltrating leukocytes. Our proof of concept study demonstrates that reduced expression of the α2 isoform in the spinal cord is protective following SCI. Importantly, the BMS and lesion volume were assessed at 7 days after SCI, and longer time points after SCI were not evaluated. However, the α2 isoform is a potential possible target of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

Treatment with MPSS and 1 and 2-weeks LLLT improved mechanical hyperalgesia (p<0.05) and heat hyperalgesia (p<0.01). The increased level of IL-6 following SCI was also compensated by administration of MPSS or LLLT (df: 4, 10; F=8.74; p=0.003). Findings show that long periods of LLLT have better effects in improving the complication of SCI.

Our results showed that EA therapy improved functional recovery, and reduced tissue loss and neuronal apoptosis after SCI. Meanwhile, we found that proapoptotic proteins (cleaved-caspase-3, 9 and cleaved-PARP) were downregulated and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was upregulated following EA. To further explore the antiapoptotic effect of EA treatment, we verified that a large set of microRNAs (miRNAs) expression were altered following EA treatment and the miR-214 was one of the miRNAs being most significantly upregulated. Importantly, we validated both apoptosis related protein Bax and pain related protein Nav1.3 as two functional targets of miR-214 in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, our data showed that EA attenuates SCI-induced Nav1.3 and Bax upregulation in injured spinal cord via upregulating miR-214.

Sodium aescinate (1.0mg/kg body weight) or equivalent volume of saline was administered 30min after injury by intravenous injection, with an additional dose daily for seven consecutive days after moderate SCI in rats. After contusion injury of the 8th thoracic (T8) spinal cord, aescin-treated rats developed less severe hind limb weakness than saline controls, as assayed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, the beam walking test, and a footprint analysis. The improved locomotor outcomes in aescin-treated rats corresponded to markedly decreased immune response, oxidative stress, neuronal loss, axon demyelination, spinal cord swelling, and cell apoptosis, measured around T8 after impact. Our data suggest aescin treatment as a novel, early, neuroprotective approach in SCI.

It is associated with a variety of injurious conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for spinal cord injury (SCI). Sivelestat sodium (SIV), a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor initially used to treat acute lung injury, has been known to protect against compression-induced and ischemic SCI. However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling in the spinal cord. The behavioral tests showed that SIV promoted functional recovery after traumatic SCI as reflected in the sustained increase in the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores throughout the observation period.

Isolated spinal cords were subjected to compression injury and treated with PEG or DSPE-PEG immediately after injury. The compound action potential (CAP) was recorded before and after injury to assess the functional recovery. Furthermore, injury potential, the difference in gap potentials before and after compression, and the concentration of intracellular ions were used to evaluate the effect of DSPE-PEG on reducing ion influx. Data showed that the injury potential and ion concentration of the untreated, PEG and DSPE-PEG group, without significant difference among them, are remarkably higher than those of the intact group. Moreover, the CAP recovery of the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated spinal cords was significantly greater than that of the untreated spinal cords. The level of CAP recovery in the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated groups was the same, but the concentration of DSPE-PEG used was much lower than the concentration of PEG. These results suggest that instant application of DSPE-PEG could effectively repair functional disturbance in SCI at a much lower concentration than PEG.","sodium","pubmed"

This study aimed to identify ways to reduce the usage and risk of high doses of glucocorticoid steroids, and determine whether AD-MSCs could be used as an early alternative treatment modality for acute SCI. Sixteen adult beagle dogs with SCI were assigned to four treatment groups: control, MPSS, AD-MSCs, and AD-MSCs + MPSS. Additionally, one dog was used to evaluate the distribution of AD-MSCs in the body after injection. AD-MSCs (1 × 10(7) cells) were injected intravenously once a day for 3 days beginning at 6 hours post-SCI. MPSS was also injected intravenously according to the standard protocol for acute SCI. A revised Tarlov scale was used to evaluate hindlimb functional recovery. The levels of markers for oxidative metabolism (3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl) and inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were also measured. At 7 days post-treatment, hindlimb movement had improved in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; however, subjects in the groups treated with MPSS exhibited gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed fewer hemorrhages and lesser microglial infiltration in the AD-MSCs group. The green fluorescent protein-expressing AD-MSCs were clearly detected in the lung, spleen, and injured spinal cord; however, these cells were not detected in the liver and un-injured spinal cord. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine were decreased in the MPSS and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; 4-hydroxynenonal and cyclooxygenase-2 levels were decreased in all treatment groups; and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator transcription 3 levels were decreased in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups. Our results suggest that early intravenous injection of AD-MSCs after acute SCI may prevent further damage through enhancement of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, without inducing adverse effects.

In this study, we generated iPSCs by using the cells originated from intervertebral disc which were removed during a spinal operation after spinal cord injury. We investigated the pluripotency of disc cell-derived iPSCs (diPSCs) and neural differentiation capability as well as therapeutic effect in spinal cord injury. The diPSCs displayed similar characteristics to human embryonic stem cells and were efficiently differentiated into neural precursor cells (NPCs) with the capability of differentiation into mature neurons in vitro. When the diPSC-derived NPCs were transplanted into mice 9 days after spinal cord injury, we detected a significant amelioration of hindlimb dysfunction during follow-up recovery periods. Histological analysis at 5 weeks after transplantation identified undifferentiated human NPCs (Nestin(+)) as well as early (Tuj1(+)) and mature (MAP2(+)) neurons derived from the transplanted NPCs. Furthermore, NPC transplantation demonstrated a preventive effect on spinal cord degeneration resulting from the secondary injury. This study revealed that intervertebral discs removed during surgery for spinal stabilization after spinal cord injury, previously considered a ""waste"" tissue, may provide a unique opportunity to study iPSCs derived from difficult-to-access somatic cells and a useful therapeutic resource for autologous cell replacement therapy in spinal cord injury.","sodium","pubmed"

Riluzole is a benzothiazole anticonvulsant with neuroprotective effects. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a safe and well-tolerated treatment for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The mechanism of action of riluzole involves the inhibition of pathologic glutamatergic transmission in synapses of neurons via sodium channel blockade. There is convincing evidence that riluzole diminishes neurological tissue destruction and promotes functional recovery in animal SCI models. Based on these results, a phase I/IIa clinical trial with riluzole was conducted for patients with SCI between 2010 and 2011. This trial demonstrated significant improvement in neurological outcomes and showed it to be a safe drug with no serious adverse effects.

Axons spared from the initial injury may later undergo secondary axonal degeneration. Lack of growth cone formation, regeneration, and loss of additional myelinated axonal projections within the spinal cord greatly limits neurological recovery following injury. To assess how central myelinated axons of the spinal cord respond to injury, we developed an ex vivo living spinal cord model utilizing transgenic mice that express yellow fluorescent protein in axons and a focal and highly reproducible laser-induced spinal cord injury to document the fate of axons and myelin (lipophilic fluorescent dye Nile Red) over time using two-photon excitation time-lapse microscopy. Dynamic processes such as acute axonal injury, axonal retraction, and myelin degeneration are best studied in real-time. However, the non-focal nature of contusion-based injuries and movement artifacts encountered during in vivo spinal cord imaging make differentiating primary and secondary axonal injury responses using high resolution microscopy challenging. The ex vivo spinal cord model described here mimics several aspects of clinically relevant contusion/compression-induced axonal pathologies including axonal swelling, spheroid formation, axonal transection, and peri-axonal swelling providing a useful model to study these dynamic processes in real-time. Major advantages of this model are excellent spatiotemporal resolution that allows differentiation between the primary insult that directly injures axons and secondary injury mechanisms; controlled infusion of reagents directly to the perfusate bathing the cord; precise alterations of the environmental milieu (e.g., calcium, sodium ions, known contributors to axonal injury, but near impossible to manipulate in vivo); and murine models also offer an advantage as they provide an opportunity to visualize and manipulate genetically identified cell populations and subcellular structures.

First, neuronal function after SCI was evaluated with Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) and the result showed that injured animals treated with apigenin showed a significant increase in BBB scores. To explore the underlying mechanism, antioxidative effect of apigenin was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities after SCI. Apigenin treatment reversed the decrease of SOD and GSH-Px activity, and the increase of MDA level caused by SCI, suggesting its antioxidative role in response to the injury. In addition, apigenin treatment decreased serum interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 release after SCI, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin.

The rats were neurologically tested 24 hours after trauma. Spinal cord samples from injury sites were harvested for measurement of lipid peroxidation products and histopathological evaluation. Spinal cord malonyldialdehyde levels of rats in treatment groups decreased after administration of ALA. The difference between the trauma group and groups receiving MPSS-ALA was statistically significant. The difference between the ALA (50, 100, 150 mg/kg) and MPSS groups was insignificant. Group 7 (ALA 200 mg/kg) was excluded from the study because of the possible toxic effect. Alpha lipoic acid and MPSS had similar effects on spinal cord injury in terms of lipid peroxidation, neurological recovery and histopathological changes. Alpha lipoic acid at a dose range of 50-150 mg/ kg is as effective as MPSS (30 mg/kg) in neuroprotection after SCI. Further, more detailed experimental studies are needed to determine the effects of ALA on the detrimental results of secondary SCI before its use in humans.","sodium","pubmed"

Seventy-two healthy New Zealand rabbits were used for the procedure and were randomly divided into two groups: SCI group and SHAM group, which was both divided into 6 subgroups, such as the vehicle group, the MPss intrathecal injection groups (1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 6.0 mg/kg group), the MPss intravenous injection group and the combined injection group. TARLOV score was tested daily to evaluate the motor function. The rabbits were sacrificed 7 days after the surgery and the thoracic spinal cord sections and the sacral sections where MPss was injected were harvested for HE and TUNEL staining. Two-Factors Repeated Measures analysis of variance for TARLOV scores tested at various times and One-Way ANOVA analysis of variance for data between groups were used.

Sensory-evoked potential recordings and quantification of axonal cytoskeleton demonstrated a riluzole-mediated improvement in axonal integrity and function. Histopathological and retrograde tracing studies demonstrated that delayed administration leads to tissue preservation and reduces apoptosis and inflammation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was undertaken to examine the pharmacokinetics of riluzole. Riluzole penetrates the spinal cord in 15 min, and SCI slowed elimination of riluzole from the spinal cord, resulting in a longer half-life and higher drug concentration in spinal cord and plasma. Initiation of riluzole treatment 1 and 3 hours post-SCI led to functional, histological, and molecular benefits. While extrapolation of post-injury time windows from rat to man is challenging, evidence from SCI-related biomarker studies would suggest that the post-injury time window is likely to be at least 12 hours in man.","sodium","pubmed"

Neutralization of NG2's inhibitory effect on axon growth by anti-NG2 monoclonal antibodies (NG2-Ab) has been reported. In addition, recent studies show that exogenous NG2 induces a block of axonal conduction. In this study, we demonstrate that acute intraspinal injections of NG2-Ab prevented an acute block of conduction by NG2. Chronic intrathecal infusion of NG2-Ab improved the following deficits induced by chronic midthoracic lateral hemisection (HX) injury: (1) synaptic transmission to lumbar motoneurons, (2) retrograde transport of fluororuby anatomical tracer from L5 to L1, and (3) locomotor function assessed by automated CatWalk gait analysis. We collected data in an attempt to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the NG2-Ab-induced improvement of synaptic transmission in HX-injured spinal cord. These data showed the following: (1) that chronic NG2-Ab infusion improved conduction and axonal excitability in chronically HX-injured rats, (2) that antibody treatment increased the density of serotonergic axons with ventral regions of spinal segments L1-L5, (3) and that NG2-positive processes contact nodes of Ranvier within the nodal gap at the location of nodal Na(+) channels, which are known to be critical for propagation of action potentials along axons. Together, these results demonstrate that treatment with NG2-Ab partially improves both synaptic and anatomical plasticity in damaged spinal cord and promotes functional recovery after HX SCI. Neutralizing antibodies against NG2 may be an excellent way to promote axonal conduction after SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

In this study, using a minipump-based infusion system, we found that intraspinal infusion with VPA for 3 days into injured spinal cord significantly improved hindlimb locomotion of rats with severe SCI induced by a 10-g NYU impactor dropping from the height of 50 mm onto the spinal T9/10 segment.

VPA also significantly reduced P2X4 R expression post-SCI. Furthermore, in vitro study indicated that VPA, but not the other HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA), caused downregulation of P2X4 R in microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-triggered signaling was involved in the effect of VPA on the inhibition of P2X4 R gene expression.

Forty adult Wistar albino rats were randomized into five groups: control, SCI alone (50 g/cm weight drop), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) (30 mg/kg), curcumin + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (300 mg/kg), and DMSO alone (0.1 mg/kg).

Curcumin was more effective than DMSO and MPSS in reducing LPO, whereas DMSO was more effective than curcumin and MPSS in minimizing ultrastuctural changes. The results of this study indicate that curcumin exerts a beneficial effect by decreasing LPO and may reduce tissue damage. Since ultrastructural and neurological findings does not support biochemical finding, our findings do not exclude the possibility that curcumin has a protective effect on the spinal cord ultrastructure and neurological recovery after SCI.

We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and previously published reviews. All randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. One review author extracted data from trial reports. Japanese and French studies were found through NASCIS and additional data (e.g. SDs) were obtained from the original study authors. Eight trials are included in this review, seven used methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post-injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg over 15 minutes, with maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial results were replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data was obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This indicated significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy, when administration commenced within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that, if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status are observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries. A modified regimen was found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. The risk of bias was low in the largest methyprednisolne trials. Overall, there was no evidence of significantly increased complications or mortality from the 23 or 48 hour therapy. High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. One trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. There is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacologic therapy for acute spinal cord injury.","sodium","pubmed"

Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined.","sodium","pubmed"

Secondary damage after traumatic SCI contributes to the exacerbation of cellular insult and thereby contributes to spinal cord dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Acidosis is commonly involved in the secondary injury process after the injury of central nervous system, but whether ASIC1a is involved in secondary injury after SCI is unclear. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal contusion using a weight-drop injury approach. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were used to observe the change of ASIC1a expression after SCI. The TUNEL staining in vivo as well as the cell viability and death assays in spinal neuronal culture were employed to assess the role of ASIC1a in the secondary spinal neuronal injury. The electrophysiological recording and Ca(2+) imaging were performed to reveal the possible underlying mechanism. The antagonists and antisense oligonucleotide for ASIC1a, lesion volume assessment assay and behavior test were used to estimate the therapeutic effect of ASIC1a on SCI. We show that ASIC1a expression is markedly increased in the peri-injury zone after traumatic SCI. Consistent with the change of ASIC1a expression in injured spinal neurons, both ASIC1a-mediated whole-cell currents and ASIC1a-mediated Ca(2+) entry are significantly enhanced after injury. We also show that increased activity of ASIC1a contributes to SCI-induced neuronal death. Importantly, our results indicate that down-regulation of ASIC1a by antagonists or antisense oligonucleotide reduces tissue damage and promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. This study reveals a cellular and molecular mechanism by which ASIC1a is involved in the secondary damage process after traumatic SCI. Our results suggest that blockade of Ca(2+) -permeable ASIC1a may be a potential neuroprotection strategy for the treatment of SCI patients.","sodium","pubmed"

Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC(50) of 2 μM. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 μM BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K(d) = 170 μM) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K(d) = 5 μM) and even more tightly (K(d) = 0.2 μM) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 μM. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels.","sodium","pubmed"

The intrinsic excitability of spinal neurons provides a novel target for medical intervention. Studies in animal models have shown that persistent inward currents, such as persistent sodium currents, profoundly influence neuronal excitability, and recovery of persistent inward currents in spinal neurons of animals with spinal cord injury routinely coincides with the appearance of spastic reflexes. Pharmacologically, this neuronal excitability can be decreased by agents that reduce persistent inward currents, such as the selective persistent sodium current inhibitor riluzole. We were able to recruit seven subjects with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury who were not concurrently taking antispasticity medications into the study. Reflex responses (flexion withdrawal and H-reflexes) and volitional strength (isometric maximum voluntary contractions) were tested at the ankle before and after placebo-controlled, double-blinded oral administration of riluzole (50 mg). Riluzole significantly decreased the peak ankle dorsiflexion torque component of the flexion withdrawal reflex. Peak maximum voluntary torque in both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion directions was not significantly changed. Average dorsiflexion torque sustained during the 5-s isometric maximum voluntary contraction, however, increased significantly. There was no effect, however, on the monosynaptic plantar and dorsiflexor H-reflex responses. Overall, these results demonstrate a contribution of persistent sodium conductances to polysynaptic reflex excitability in human chronic spinal cord injury without a significant role in maximum strength production. These results suggest that intrinsic spinal cellular excitability could be a target for managing chronic spinal cord injury hyperreflexia impairments without causing a significant loss in volitional strength.","sodium","pubmed"

(2) What is the preclinical evidence for Rho antagonists that have allowed this group of compounds to move into clinical trials? (3) What is the evidence for early surgical decompression after SCI?

A phase I safety clinical trial of riluzole is about to commence in the USA and Canada.  The key challenges in translating riluzole to the clinic relate to uncertainty regarding the time window for post-injury administration of riluzole and the optimal dose. Hence, the current study was undertaken to study these issues in a preclinical model of cervical SCI in rodents.  Adult female rats received moderate cervical spinal cord clip compression injury (35 g × 1 min at C7-T1) and were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups (n = 12/group): a) 8 mg/kg of riluzole intraperitoneally at 1 hour (P1 group) ; b) 3 hours (P3 group) after injury or c) a control group (vehicle). The P1 and P3 groups then received 6 mg/kg of riluzole intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 7 days. A smaller group of rats (n = 10) received a higher dose (8 mg/kg IP Q12 h for 7 days) of riluzole following the initial dosing. Functional recovery was tested by open field locomotion (BBB score, BBB subscore) and grid walk. Sensory function (tactile allodynia) was assessed by quantitative von Frey filament testing. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were performed to quantitatively assess central axonal conduction. Western blotting for neurofilament 200 (NF200) was used to assess axonal integrity. Quantitative image analysis of lesion histology (HE/LFB stained sections) was undertaken to assess tissue sparing at the injury site. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to test pharmacokinetics of riluzole. ANOVA followed by the Tukey's post-hoc testing was used to compare the results.  A total of 92.3% of injured rats that received repeated dose of 6 mg/kg riluzole survived during the term of 6 weeks, showing tolerance to this dosage. In contrast, higher doses of riluzole (8mg/kg IP q12h post-injury) were associated with significant respiratory depression and high mortality (7/10 rats). Riluzole treatment (P1 group) decreased the functional deficit significantly (P < 0.05) at 6 weeks after injury by showing 11.4 in BBB, 3.8 in BBB subscore and 2.8 in grid walk test, compared with 10.25 in BBB, 1.1 in BBB subscore, and 8.0 in grid walk test of control group (Figure 1). Quantitative analysis of SSEPs confirmed the neuroprotective effects of riluzole (P1 group) by showing significantly larger amplitude (control = 20.67 µV, P1 = 42.67 µV and P3 = 37.00 µV, Figure 2) and reduced response latency (control = 4.05 ms and P1 = 3.9 ms). Western blotting of NF200 indicated greater axonal preservation with riluzole treatment (P1 group) at 1 week after injury. The P3 group showed trends to improved neurobehavioral recovery and axonal preservation that did not attain significance. HPLC showed riluzole penetrated into the spinal cord as fast as 15 minutes, accumulated in the spinal cord at a concentration six times higher than in plasma, and two times higher than in brain. The drug stayed in spinal cord with a high concentration before the next injection. Figure 1 Riluzole treatment improved functional recovery. The most robust effects were seen when the drug was injected at one hour after SCIFigure 2 Riluzole treatment increased amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials Conclusions:  The sodium-glutamate blocker riluzole confers neurobehavioral and anatomical neuroprotection when administered one hour after moderately severe cervical contusive/compressive injury.","sodium","pubmed"

Literature review of anatomical, immunohistochemical, and pharmacologic studies of normal and dysfunctional bladder afferent pathways. Studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through coordination centers (periaqueductal gray and pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brain stem. This reflex pathway, which is activated by small myelinated (Adelta) bladder afferent nerves, is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Spinal cord injury at cervical or thoracic levels disrupts voluntary voiding, as well as the normal reflex pathways that coordinate bladder and sphincter function. Following spinal cord injury, the bladder is initially areflexic but then becomes hyperreflexic due to the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. The recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury is dependent in part on the plasticity of bladder afferent pathways and the unmasking of reflexes triggered by unmyelinated, capsaicin-sensitive, C-fiber bladder afferent neurons. Plasticity is associated with morphologic, chemical, and electrical changes in bladder afferent neurons and appears to be mediated in part by neurotrophic factors released in the spinal cord and the peripheral target organs. Spinal cord injury at sites remote from the lumbosacral spinal cord can indirectly influence properties of bladder afferent neurons by altering the function and chemical environment in the bladder or the spinal cord.","sodium","pubmed"

To reconsider effects of the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study. High dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) for the patients with acute spinal cord injury has been considered standard treatment in the several countries. However, many authors have criticized the effect of MPSS because of lack of evidence about neurologic improvement and the high incidence of complications. During 2-year, all patients with cervical cord injury were treated with MPSS within 8 hours of their injuries based on the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study protocol (MPSS group). During the next 2-year, all patients were treated without MPSS (non-MPSS group). There were 38 patients in the MPSS group and 41 in the non-MPSS. Early spinal decompression and stabilization was performed as soon after injury in both the groups. According to The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score, there was an average improvement by 3 months postinjury of 12.4 points in the MPSS group and 13.8 points in the non-MPSS group. In patients with complete motor loss, average ASIA motor score improved 9.0 points in the MPSS group and 12.6 points in the non-MPSS group. For patients with incomplete motor loss, average ASIA motor score improvement was 14.1 and 15.5 points in the MPSS and non-MPSS groups, respectively.In the MPSS group, 19 patients developed pneumonia, 13 developed urinary tract infections, and 5 developed wound infections. Incidence of pneumonia was significantly increased with the use of MPSS medication. We found no evidence supporting the opinion that high-dose MPSS administration facilitates neurologic improvement in patients with spinal cord injury. We believe MPSS should be used under limited circumstances because of the high incidence of pulmonary complication.","sodium","pubmed"

The functional consequences of experimental SCI have been assessed in many ways. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of MPSS vs. saline solution (SS) following moderate T10 contusion injury in rat. Functional recovery was evaluated using the 21-point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor recovery scale, the inclined plane, the beam walk, footprint analysis and the horizontal ladder. To optimize the precision and accuracy of functional results we examined the locomotion on a treadmill using three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Stereology was used to estimate the amount of damaged tissue. The results of the traditional functional methods showed that administration of the NASCIS dosage of MPSS following acute spinal cord contusion did not lead to any significant differences in the functional recovery of MPSS- vs. SS-treated animals. More importantly, the results of the 3D kinematic showed that the MPSS administration did not affect the flexion/extension of the hip, knee and ankle joints during the step cycle. Finally, stereological results revealed no statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups. Altogether, our results support data previously reported by several authors, suggesting that MPSS does not lead to improved functional outcome following experimental acute SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

Our purpose was to explore emergency department (ED) response to this shifting information by assessing the impact of NASCIS and the 2002 report on MPSS protocols and to study factors associated with MPSS administration. Availability of protocols and hospital characteristics were determined by survey of all hospitals with EDs in South Carolina. Protocol copies were obtained and reviewed for accuracy based on NASCIS. Patient hospital discharge information was collected through the state Office of Research and Statistics, and factors associated with receiving MPSS were evaluated using multivariable techniques. Having a protocol was associated with trauma level designation and volume of traumatic spinal cord injury patients per annum, with 100% of Level I trauma facilities having a protocol. Across all trauma levels, 40% of reporting EDs had an MPSS protocol, with 86% of these accurate, and none withdrawn during the study. Patient factors associated with being less likely to receive MPSS were female gender, injury below thoracic level, and treatment in an undesignated trauma center.

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model.

Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole--after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), phenytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p<0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment.

This neural system coordinates the activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract: (1) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (2) an outlet (consisting of bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the pelvic floor). During urine storage the outlet is closed and the bladder is quiescent, thereby maintaining a low intravesical pressure over a wide range of bladder volumes. During micturition the outlet relaxes and the bladder contracts to promote the release of urine. This reciprocal relationship between bladder and outlet is generated by visceral reflex circuits, some of which are under voluntary control. Experimental studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination center (the pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brainstem.

We extend the previous findings by demonstrating in the present study that rats subjected to a left C2 hemisection with bilateral carotid body excision will also recover respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. However, in this instance, recovery is significantly accelerated; i.e., it is evident as early as 2 weeks after spinal cord injury. Two experimental groups (and noninjured and sham-operated controls) of rats were employed in the study. H-CBE animals were subjected to a left C2 hemisection plus bilateral carotid body excision while H-CBI animals were subjected to a left C2 hemisection only. Carotid body excision was confirmed by the sodium cyanide test. The animals were allowed to survive for 2 weeks after hemisection. Thereafter, electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity was conducted in all animals. Spontaneous recovery of respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed hemidiaphragm (indicated by left phrenic nerve activity) was detected in all H-CBE animals while H-CBI animals did not express spontaneous recovery of diaphragmatic activity. The magnitude of recovered activity when expressed as a function of contralateral phrenic nerve activity was 48.8 +/- 3.8%. When expressed as a function of the homolateral phrenic nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude amounted to 25.6 +/- 2.8%. Although the mechanisms responsible for the apparent early onset of spontaneous recovery are unknown, it is likely that a reorganization of the respiratory circuitry in the CNS may be involved. The significance of the findings is that it may be feasible to modulate the onset of functional recovery following cervical spinal cord injury by specifically targeting peripheral chemoreceptors.","sodium","pubmed"

The aim of the present study was to show the neuroprotective effect of phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker, after experimental SCI. Control and laminectomy-only groups were not injured. 50 g-cm weight drop injury was produced in the trauma group. In the treatment groups, methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) and phenytoin (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally immediately after injury. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the spinal cord samples were examined for lipid peroxidation. Spinal cord ultrastructure was evaluated and grading system was used for quantitative evaluation. Trauma increased tissue MDA levels. Treatment with methylprednisolone and phenytoin decreased MDA levels compared to trauma in all doses. Significant ultrastructural neuroprotection was observed with 30 mg/kg of phenytoin treatment according to general neural score. This ultrastructural neuroprotection of phenytoin was not different from methylprednisolone. Phenytoin appears to protect spinal cord against injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation and lessening neuronal damage associated with SCI in rats.","sodium","pubmed"

Review article. The publication of the first National Acute Spinal Cord Injury (NASCIS) trial in 1984 ushered in the era of pharmacological trials of therapies intended to improve neurologic outcome in acute SCI. Subsequent trials of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) and GM-1 have added to the evidence basis that informs the current management practices for acute SCI. The last 50 years have seen a conceptual shift from the pessimism of the past to a cautious optimism that the meager prognosis for neurologic recovery in acute SCI will yield to the progress of medical science. Major advances in the understanding of primary and secondary injury mechanisms have led to the preclinical study of many promising pharmacological therapies, all with the goal of improving neurologic outcome. A few of these drugs have stood the test of animal model experiments and have made it to the forum of human clinical trials. The NASCIS trials of methylprednisolone have been acknowledged widely as the first human studies to claim improved neurologic outcome. Although the results of these trials remain controversial, the MPSS therapy that they reported has been adopted widely by clinicians around the world as the best currently available, even if not a consensus ""standard of care."" Clearly, the challenge for medical science remains. The search for effective treatment has only begun.","sodium","pubmed"

We investigated the cellular composition of residual white matter chronically to determine whether TTX also has a significant effect on the numbers and types of cells present. Rats received an incomplete thoracic contusion injury, in the presence or absence of TTX (0.15 nmole) injected focally, beginning at 15 min prior to injury. Six weeks later, cell density was significantly increased in the residual white matter of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral funiculi, both rostral and caudal to the injury site in both TTX-treated and injury control groups. Oligodendrocyte and astrocyte density was similar to normal but large numbers of cells expressing microglia/macrophage markers were present. Labeling with the progenitor markers nestin and NG2 showed that precursor cell density had also doubled or tripled as compared with uninjured controls. Some of these cells were also labeled for antigens that indicate their possible progression along an oligodendrocyte or astrocyte lineage. Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of TTX in SCI is related to its preservation of axons per se; no effect on chronic white matter cell composition was detected. They highlight the profound changes in cellular composition in preserved white matter chronically at 6 weeks after injury, including the accumulation of endogenous progenitor cells and the persistence of activated macrophages/microglia. The manipulation of these endogenous cells may be used in the future to enhance recovery after SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 contusion SCI after being fed normal chow or chow containing phenytoin; serum levels of phenytoin were within therapeutic range at the time of injury. At various timepoints after injury, quantitative assessment of lesion volumes, axonal degeneration, axonal conduction, and functional locomotor recovery were performed.

In the present study we examined the role of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) at physiological temperatures after hypoxia/ischemia and compressive injury to spinal cord dorsal column white matter in vitro. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber (maintained at 37 degrees C) and injured by exposure to a hypoxic atmosphere for 60 minutes or compressed with a modified aneurysm clip (2-gm closing force) for 15 seconds. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential (CAP) with glass microelectrodes. The mean CAP decreased to 49.5 +/- 5.7% and 49.4 +/- 2.6% of control (p<.05) after hypoxia/ischemia and compressive injury, respectively. KB-R7943, a potent, selective NCX reverse mode inhibitor, significantly promoted greater recovery of CAP amplitude to 82.0 +/- 10.0% and 70.8 +/- 10.7% of control (p<.05) after hypoxic/ischemic or compressive injury to dorsal column white matter, respectively, when applied at 10 microM concentration. Bepridil (Research Biochemical Inc., Natick, MA, USA) (a less selective NCX inhibitor), when applied at 10 microM and 50 microM concentration promoted CAP amplitude recovery only to 46.8 +/- 7.8% and 29.9 +/- 3.3% of control, respectively, after hypoxic/ischemic injury to dorsal column white matter. Western blot analysis identified NCX presence with positive immunolabeling of 160 kD and 120 kD NCX proteins in the spinal cord white matter. In conclusion, at physiological temperature NCX activation plays an important role in intracellular calcium overload after hypoxic/ischemic and compressive injury to spinal cord dorsal column white matter in vitro.","sodium","pubmed"

A more recent trial indicates that if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (for a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status is observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries and a modified regimen found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. High dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacological therapy shown to have efficacy in a Phase Three randomized trial when it can be administered within eight hours of injury. A recent trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury.

In the present work, we examine PROG effects on three measures of neuronal function under negative regulation (choline acetyltransferase [ChAT] and Na,K-ATPase) or stimulated (growth-associated protein [GAP-43]) after acute spinal cord transection injury in rats. As expected, spinal cord injury reduced ChAT immunostaining intensity of ventral horn neurons. A 3-day course of intensive PROG treatment of transected rats restored ChAT immunoreactivity, as assessed by frequency histograms that recorded shifts from predominantly light neuronal staining to medium, dark or intense staining typical of control rats. Transection also reduced the expression of the mRNA for the alpha3 catalytic and beta1 regulatory subunits of neuronal Na,K-ATPase, whereas PROG treatment restored both subunit mRNA to normal levels. Additionally, the upregulation observed for GAP-43 mRNA in ventral horn neurons in spinal cord-transected rats, was further enhanced by PROG administration. In no case did PROG modify ChAT immunoreactivity, Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNA or GAP-43 mRNA in control, sham-operated rats. Further, the PROG-mediated effects on these three markers were observed in large, presumably Lamina IX motoneurons, as well as in smaller neurons measuring approximately <500 micro2. Overall, the stimulatory effects of PROG on ChAT appears to replenish acetylcholine, with its stimulatory effects on Na,K-ATPase seems capable of restoring membrane potential, ion transport and nutrient uptake. PROG effects on GAP-43 also appear to accelerate reparative responses to injury. As the cellular basis for PROG neuroprotection becomes better understood it may prove of therapeutic benefit to spinal cord injury patients.","sodium","pubmed"

The mechanisms for its beneficial actions are not entirely clear, but experimental evidence suggests MPSS affords some degree of neuroprotection. As many studies with rat models of SCI have been unable to demonstrate improved behavioral outcome or tissue sparing after MPSS treatment, we chose to stereologically assess whether it alters lesion volume and tissue sparing over time, as well as long-term behavioral recovery. Adult rats subjected to contusion SCI with the NYU impactor were administered either MPSS or saline for 24 hr beginning 5 min post injury. Over time the lesion dimensions were extremely dynamic, such that by 6 weeks post injury the volumes were reduced to a third of those seen after the first week. MPSS marginally reduced lesion volumes across time vs. controls, but the amount of spared gray and white matter remained unaltered between the two groups. Behavioral results further showed that MPSS failed to improve recovery of hind-limb function. These findings add to the emerging scrutiny of MPSS as the standard therapy for acute SCI, as well as indicate the existence of a therapeutic window for tissue sparing restricted to the first several days after this type of SCI in rats. Equally important, our results caution the use of lesion volume dimensions or percent tissue sparing at the epicenter as indicators of therapeutic efficacy because neither reflects the actual amount of tissue sparing.","sodium","pubmed"

However, the precise cellular mechanisms of glutamate release from non-synaptic white matter are not well understood. We examined how the collapse of transmembrane Na(+) and K(+) gradients induces reverse operation of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporters, leading to glutamate efflux and injury to rat spinal dorsal columns in vitro. Compound action potentials were irreversibly reduced to 43% of control after ouabain/high K(+)/low Na(+) exposure (500 microM ouabain for 30 min to increase [Na(+)](i), followed by 1 h ouabain+high K(+) (129 mM)/low Na(+) (27 mM), to further reverse transmembrane ion gradients) followed by a 2 h wash. Ca(2+)-free perfusate was very protective (compound action potential amplitude recovered to 87% vs. 43%). The broad spectrum glutamate antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM) or the selective AMPA antagonist GYKI52466 (30 microM) were partially protective (68% recovery). Inhibition of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport with L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (1 mM) also provided significant protection (71% recovery), similar to that seen with glutamate receptor antagonists. Blocking reverse Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange with KB-R7943 (10 microM) however, was ineffective in this paradigm (49% recovery). Semiquantitative glutamate immunohistochemistry revealed that levels of this amino acid were significantly depleted in axon cylinders and, to a lesser degree, in oligodendrocytes (but not in astrocytes) by ouabain/high K(+)/low Na(+), which was largely prevented by glutamate transport inhibition. Our data show that dorsal column white matter contains the necessary glutamate pools and release mechanisms to induce significant injury. When Na(+) and K(+) gradients are disrupted, even in the absence of reduced cellular energy reserves, reverse operation of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport will release enough endogenous glutamate to activate AMPA receptors and cause substantial Ca(2+)-dependent injury. This mechanism likely plays an important role during ischemic and traumatic white matter injury, where collapse of transmembrane Na(+) and K(+) gradients occurs.","sodium","pubmed"

Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment. This first decade of the new millennium, now touted as the Decade of the Spine, will hopefully witness the emergence of universal and efficacious pharmacologic therapy and ultimately a cure for SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

All three Na+ channel blockers significantly enhanced residual tissue area at the injury epicenter compared with control. Riluzole significantly reduced tissue loss in rostrocaudal regions surrounding the epicenter, with overall sparing of gray matter and selective sparing of white matter. Also, counts of red nuclei neurons retrogradely labeled with fluorogold introduced caudal to the injury site were significantly increased in the riluzole group.

For the first time, similar methodology also has been applied to study the effects of hypothermia. Canine spinal cords were injured at T13 by use of an epidural balloon and then were treated with local hypothermia or intramuscular dexamethasone or both. Motor recovery was assessed using a modified Tarlov scale. At either 6 days or 7 weeks, spinal cords T8 through L4 were removed and divided into 10 ordered blocks, which were analyzed for wet and dry weight, potassium concentration, and sodium concentration. Correlations between clinical motor and chemical results were evaluated. The conclusions drawn are as follows: 1) The canine severe rapid compressive injury model, unlike the previously published less severe feline impact injury model, is not associated with widespread early loss of spinal cord tissue potassium content (dry weight). 2) The dog compressive model, unlike the cat impact model, does not provide evidence that one fundamental mechanism of the confirmed beneficial action of steroids entails enhanced early preservation of tissue potassium content. 3) At 6 days, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and increase in sodium concentration, representing edema, occurred at and adjacent to the direct compression site in all lesioned dog groups except those treated with dexamethasone, demonstrating an antiedema effect of dexamethasone that was nullified by concurrent local hypothermia. 4) This antiedema effect of dexamethasone was associated with superior early motor improvement but did not lead to superior long-term function, in comparison with hypothermia. 5) At 7 weeks, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and potassium concentration, and increase in sodium concentration, all restricted to the directly compressed segment, signify necrosis. 6) This new chemical index of necrosis was highly correlated with clinical motor performance.","sodium","pubmed"

Excessive cellular Ca(2+) accumulation is a common phenomenon after anoxia/ischemia or mechanical trauma to white matter, leading to irreversible injury because of overactivation of multiple Ca(2+)-dependent biochemical pathways. In the present study, we examined the role of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, a ubiquitous Ca(2+) transport mechanism, in anoxic and traumatic injury to rat spinal dorsal columns in vitro. Excised tissue was maintained in a recording chamber at 37 degrees C and injured by exposure to an anoxic atmosphere for 60 min or locally compressed with a force of 2 g for 15 s. Mean compound action potential amplitude recovered to approximately 25% of control after anoxia and to approximately 30% after trauma. Inhibitors of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange (50 microM bepridil or 10 microM KB-R7943) improved functional recovery to approximately 60% after anoxia and approximately 70% after traumatic compression. These inhibitors also prevented the increase in calpain-mediated spectrin breakdown products induced by anoxia. We conclude that, at physiological temperature, reverse Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange plays an important role in cellular Ca(2+) overload and irreversible damage after anoxic and traumatic injury to dorsal column white matter tracts.","sodium","pubmed"

For the NASCIS, Japanese and French trials, additional data (e.g. SDs) have been obtained from the original authors. There are few trials in this area of medical care. Only one therapy has been extensively studied, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, which has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post injury if administered within 8 hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg administered over 15 minutes with a maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial was replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data has been obtained from the latter study to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This analysis indicates significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy. A more recent trial indicates that if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (for a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status is observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between 3 to 8 hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries and a modified regimen found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. High dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacological therapy shown to have efficacy in a Phase Three randomized trial when it can be administered within 8 hours of injury. High dose methylprednisolone has been accepted as standard therapy in many countries. A recent trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours if start of treatment must be delayed to between 3 and 8 hours after injury.

In order to determine the doses, durations and timing of methylprednisolone treatment for optimal neuroprotection, a single or two bolus dose of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) was administered at 10, 30, 120, 150 and 240 min. after three graded spinal cord injury. The primary outcome measure was 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes estimated from spinal cord Na+ and K+ shifts. A single 30 mg/kg dose of methylprednisolone at 10 min. after injury significantly reduced 24-hour lesion volumes in injured rat spinal cords. However, any other methylprednisolone treatment starting 30 min. or more after injury had no effect on 24-hour lesion volumes compared to the vehicle control group. Moreover, delayed treatment increased lesion volumes in some cases. These results suggest that the NYU SCI model has a very short therapeutic window.","sodium","pubmed"

The stimulators were of a previously unpublished design and meet the requirements for phase I human clinical testing. All dogs were treated within 18 days of the onset of paraplegia. During the experimental applications, all received the highest standard of conventional management, including surgical decompression, spinal stabilization (if required), and acute administration of methylprednisolone sodium succinate. A radiologic and neurologic examination was performed on every dog entering the study, the latter consisting of standard reflex testing, urologic tests, urodynamic testing, tests for deep and superficial pain appreciation, proprioceptive placing of the hind limbs, ambulation, and evoked potential testing. Dogs were evaluated before and after surgery and at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. A greater proportion of experimentally treated dogs than of sham-treated animals showed improvement in every category of functional evaluation at both the 6-week and 6-month recheck, with no reverse trend. Statistical significance was not reached in comparisons of some individual categories of functional evaluation between sham-treated and OFS-treated dogs (ambulation, proprioceptive placing); an early trend towards significance was shown in others (deep pain), and significance was reached in evaluations of superficial pain appreciation. An average of all individual scores for all categories of blinded behavioral evaluation (combined neurologic score) was used to compare group outcomes. At the 6-month recheck period, the combined neurologic score of OFS-treated dogs was significantly better than that of control dogs (p = 0.047; Mann-Whitney, two-tailed).","sodium","pubmed"

We hypothesized that blockade of sodium channels after SCI would reduce WM loss and long-term functional deficits. To test this hypothesis, a sufficient and safe dose (0.15 nmol) of the potent Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) was determined through a dose-response study. We microinjected TTX or vehicle (VEH) into the injury site at 15 min after a standardized contusive SCI in the rat. Behavioral tests were performed 1 d after injury and weekly thereafter. Quantitative histopathology at 8 weeks postinjury showed that TTX treatment significantly reduced tissue loss at the injury site, with greater effect on sparing of WM than gray matter. TTX did not change the pattern of chronic histopathology typical of this SCI model, but restricted its extent, tripled the area of residual WM at the epicenter, and reduced the average length of the lesions. Serotonin immunoreactivity caudal to the epicenter, a marker for descending motor control axons, was nearly threefold that of VEH controls. The increase in WM at the epicenter was significantly correlated with the decrease in functional deficits. The TTX group exhibited a significantly enhanced recovery of coordinated hindlimb functions, more normal hindlimb reflexes, and earlier establishment of a reflex bladder. The results demonstrate that Na+ channels play a critical role in WM loss in vivo after SCI.","sodium","pubmed"

Central myelinated axons are damaged by anoxia/ischemia in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Leakage of Na+ into the axoplasm through Na+ channels causes Ca2+ overload mainly by reverse Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Na+ channel blockers have thus been shown to be protective in an in vitro anoxic rat optic nerve model. Mexiletine (10 microM-1 mM), an antiarrhythmic and use-dependent Na+ channel blocker, was also significantly protective, as measured by recovery of the compound action potential after a 60 min anoxic exposure in vitro. More importantly, mexiletine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly protected optic nerves from injury in a model of in situ ischemia. This in situ model is more clinically relevant as it addresses drug pharmacokinetics, toxicity and CNS penetration. Optic nerve recovery cycles (defined as shifts in latency of compound action potentials with paired stimulation) were used to measure the concentration of mexiletine in optic nerves after systemic administration, estimated at approximately 42 microM 1 h after a single dose of 80 mg/kg, i.p. These results indicate that mexiletine is able to penetrate into the CNS at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Na+ channel blockers such as mexiletine may prove to be effective clinical therapeutic agents for protecting CNS white matter tracts against anoxic/ischemic injury.","sodium","pubmed"

Dorsal column segments from adult rats (n = 87) were isolated and maintained in an in vitro recording chamber while being superfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution (95% O2/5% CO2, 25 degrees C). Selected experiments (n = 10) also were done at 33 degrees C. Compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded from microelectrodes. Injury was performed by compression of the dorsal column segment for 15 sec with a modified aneurysm clip exerting a closing force of 2 gm. With injury, the CAP decreased to 72.1 +/- 9.6% of baseline values. Removal of extracellular Na+ and replacement with the impermeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine enhanced recovery of the CAP to 98.3 +/- 18.3% (p < 0.05) of baseline. The Na+ channel blockers tetrodotoxin and procaine also improved recovery of the CAP to 96.3 +/- 23.7% (p < 0.05) and 82.8 +/- 4.6% (p < 0.05) of baseline values, respectively. In contrast, increasing Na+ permeability with veratridine resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude after 1 hr of trauma (60.1 +/- 8.4%, p < 0.05). Similarly, prevention of extrusion of Na+ from the intracellular compartment by inhibiting the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump with ouabain resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude at 1 hr after trauma (56.7 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.05). The Na(+)-H+ exchange blockers amiloride (100 microM) and harmaline (100 microM) significantly improved recovery after injury to 89.6 +/- 17.0% (p < 0.05) and 85.7 +/- 7.2% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively. However, administration of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange blockers benzamil (100 or 500 microM) and bepridil (50 microM) was ineffective. In summary, reduction of extracellular Na+ confers neuroprotection after spinal cord injury in vitro. Intracellular sodium rises appear to be mediated by voltage-gated Na+ channels. Blockade of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger also is neuroprotective, possibly by reducing intracellular acidosis. Furthermore, prevention of extrusion of intracellular Na+ by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump exacerbates the effects of compression trauma. However, reverse operation of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger does not explain the injurious effects of Na+ in traumatically injured CNS white matter.","sodium","pubmed"

Because GM1 may have additive or synergistic effects when used with MP, the authors compared MP, GM1, and MP+GM1 treatments in a graded rat spinal cord contusion model. Spinal cord injury was caused by dropping a rod weighing 10 gm from a height of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 cm onto the rat spinal cord at T-10, which had been exposed via laminectomy. The lesion volumes were quantified from spinal cord Na and K shifts at 24 hours after injury and the results were verified histologically in separate experiments. A single dose of MP (30 mg/kg), given 5 minutes after injury, reduced 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes by 56% (p = 0.0052), 28% (p = 0.0065), and 13% (p > 0.05) in the three injury-severity groups, respectively, compared to similarly injured control groups treated with vehicle only. Methylprednisolone also prevented injury-induced hyponatremia and increased body weight loss in the spine-injured rats. When used alone, GM1 (10 to 30 mg/kg) had little or no effect on any measured variable compared to vehicle controls; when given concomitantly with MP, GM1 blocked the neuroprotective effects of MP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, GM1 partially prevented MP-induced reductions in lesion volumes, while 10 to 30 mg/kg of GM1 completely blocked these effects of MP. The effects of MP on injury-induced hyponatremia and body weight loss were also blocked by GM1. Thus, GM1 antagonized both central and peripheral effects of MP in spine-injured rats. Until this interaction is clarified, the authors recommend that MP and GM1 not be used concomitantly to treat acute human spinal cord injury. Because GM1 modulates protein kinase activity, protein kinases inhibit lipocortins, and lipocortins mediate anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, it is proposed that the neuroprotective effects of MP are partially due to anti-inflammatory effects and that GM1 antagonizes the effects of MP by inhibiting lipocortin. Possible beneficial effects of GM1 reported in central nervous system injury may be related to the effects on neural recovery rather than acute injury processes.","sodium","pubmed"

Measurements of interstitial ion activity in the grey matter at the injury site (with ion-selective electrodes), showed a decrease of sodium and calcium, an increase of potassium, a small acidification and a negative shift in the electrical potential 5 min after injury. The interstitial ionic changes were completely reversible within 90 min following injury. Measurements of the ion content in a tissue sample from the injury site (flame photometry) showed an increase of sodium and calcium and a decrease of potassium 5 min after injury. The magnitude of the post-injury sodium change was much larger than the potassium change, both for interstitial and tissue measurements. Treatment of the animals with the calcium entry blocker flunarizine before the injury did not influence the magnitude of post-injury interstitial calcium decrease but significantly increased the rate of subsequent recovery. Pre-injury flunarizine treatment also significantly increased the recovery rate of the electrical potential. The experiments suggest the occurrence of a net ionic shift towards the intracellular space, which may contribute to oedema formation in the very early post-injury period. The post-injury decrease of interstitial calcium activity is probably not mediated by flunarizine-sensitive calcium entry mechanisms; such mechanisms may, however, be involved in the subsequent recovery period for interstitial calcium activity. Calcium ions may be involved in the recovery process of the negative electrical potential after injury.","sodium","pubmed"

The experimental groups were as follows: group A (n = 7), control group, receiving no pharmacologic intervention; group B (n = 7), deferoxamine 50 mg/kg/day administered intravenously over 3 to 4 hours before ischemia; group C (n = 7), allopurinol pretreatment 50 mg/kg/day for 3 days; and group D (n = 7), superoxide dismutase 60,000 units administered with 50,000 units before removal of the aortic crossclamp and 10,000 units over 10 minutes of reperfusion. Proximal hypertension was controlled with sodium nitroprusside and volume depletion. The methods of assessment were neurologic by a modified Tarlov criteria and blood flow by radiolabeled microspheres. Results of blood flow assessment confirmed a true ischemic episode of 30 minutes for all animals in all groups. The blood flow fell significantly during ischemia (p less than 0.01) and a hyperemic response was evident in the early reperfusion period. All animals in control group A were paraplegic. The group B (deferoxamine) results were superior; 85% had grade III function on a modified Tarlov scale, with animals in the group standing and even walking with difficulty. Only one animal in this group had good movements of hind limbs but was unable to stand or walk. Neurologic recovery was limited in the allopurinol group (group C), with 85% showing slight neurologic recovery with limited movement of the hind limbs. The animals in the superoxide dismutase group (group D) all had good recovery, with strong motor response of hind limbs, but were not able to stand. In summary, the results of this experimental protocol confirmed the possible role of oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury, induced by aortic crossclamping.

The pathophysiology of demyelinated axons depends, in part, on their ion channel organization. Myelinated axons display a complementary distribution of sodium channels (clustered in the nodal axon membrane) and fast potassium channels (in the internodal axon membrane). The low density of sodium channels in the internodal axon membrane will impede conduction after demyelination. Moreover, ""unmasked"" potassium channels will tend to clamp the axon membrane close to EK, interfering with conduction in demyelinated axons. Pharmacologic blockade of these potassium channels can increase the safety factor for conduction in demyelinated axons. Restoration of conduction in demyelinated axons, so that action potentials can traverse the zone without myelin, appears to underly clinical remissions in patients with multiple sclerosis and may occur in some patients with spinal cord injury. At a cellular level, conduction through demyelinated axon regions can be facilitated by several mechanisms, including remyelination, development of excitability in demyelinated regions (which requires an adequate density of sodium channels), and impedance matching. Astrocytes have been shown to establish a specific relationship with sodium channel-rich regions of the axon membrane, and may play a role in the deployment and/or maintenance of sodium channels within the demyelinated axon membrane. Calcium influx appears to play a critical role in the cascade of events leading to secondary injury after spinal cord trauma. Recent observations suggest the hypothesis that myelin damage in spinal cord trauma may be mediated, at least in part, by influx of calcium into an intracellular compartment. As the route of calcium entry is identified and characterized, it may be possible to design strategies that will limit secondary injury after CNS trauma. The deleterious effects of calcium in injured white matter accumulate gradually, which suggests the potential reversibility of dysfunction in spinal cord tracts if treated early after trauma.","sodium","pubmed"

Studies in animals have shown that monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM-1) ganglioside enhances the functional recovery of damaged neurons. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of GM-1 ganglioside was conducted in patients with spinal-cord injuries. Of 37 patients entered into the study, 34 (23 with cervical injuries and 11 with thoracic injuries) completed the test-drug protocol (100 mg of GM-1 sodium salt or placebo intravenously per day for 18 to 32 doses, with the first dose taken within 72 hours of the injury) and a one-year follow-up period. Neurologic recovery was assessed with the Frankel scale (comprising five categories) and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score (a scale of scores from 0 to 100, derived from strength tests of 20 specific muscles, each scored from 0 to 5). There was a significant difference between groups in the distribution of improvement of Frankel grades from base line to the one-year follow-up (improvement of 0, 1, 2, and 3 grades in 13, 4, 1, and 0 patients, respectively, in the placebo group and 8, 1, 6, and 1 patients, respectively, in the GM-1 group; P = 0.034 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test). The GM-1-treated patients also had a significantly greater mean improvement in ASIA motor score from base line to the one-year follow-up than the placebo-treated patients (36.9 vs. 21.6 points; P = 0.047 by analysis of covariance with the base-line ASIA motor score as the covariate). An analysis of individual muscle recoveries revealed that the increased recovery in the GM-1 group was attributable to initially paralyzed muscles that regained useful motor strength rather than to strengthening of paretic muscles. This small study provides evidence that GM-1 enhances the recovery of neurologic function after one year. A larger study must be conducted, however, before GM-1 is considered efficacious and safe in treating spinal-cord injury.","sodium","pubmed"

These include the synthetic glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP), and the new 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, U74006F. Treatment of spinal cord-injured cats with high doses of MP promoted or spared locomotor function and preserved spinal cord tissue. Extending these findings in cats to humans, it was recently demonstrated that high doses of MP administered within 8 h of injury significantly improved neurologic recovery in human spinal cord-injured patients. The compound U74006F is one of a series of 21-aminosteroids that, unlike MP, lack glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid or other hormonal activity yet are potent inhibitors of lipid perioxidation. Over a 100-fold range of doses, U74006F promoted recovery of locomotor function in spinal cord-injured cats. The lowest effective dose for U74006F was 100 times lower than the maximally effective dose for MP. The efficacy of U74006F is unchanged if treatment is initiated within 4 h of injury. However, if treatment is delayed for 8 h, the therapeutic potency of U74006F is substantially reduced. These findings suggest that antioxidant therapy can successfully limit the effects of both experimental and clinical spinal cord injury especially if the treatment is initiated shortly after injury.","sodium","pubmed"

Fifteen minutes after fluid-percussion brain injury (2.8 atmospheres), animals received either MK-801 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or saline. MK-801 treatment significantly attenuated the development of focal brain edema at the site of injury 48 h after brain injury, significantly reduced the increase in tissue sodium, and prevented the localized decline in total tissue magnesium that was observed in injured tissue of saline-treated animals. Using phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we also observed that MK-801 treatment improved brain metabolic status and promoted a significant recovery of intracellular free magnesium concentrations that fell precipitously after brain injury.

Interestingly, it has been reported that FK506 increases neurite outgrowth in cell cultures, implying a potential impact in putative treatments of neurodegenerative disorders and injuries of the nervous system. Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of this compound is poorly understood and remains to be elucidated, with the only certainty that its neurotrophic effect is independent of its primary immunosuppressant activity. In this study it is demonstrated that FK506 shows efficient neurotrophic action in vitro and profound effects on the recovery of locomotor activity, behavioural features, and erectile function of mice that underwent surgical spinal cord injury. The recovery of the locomotor activity was studied in knock-out mice for either immunophilin, FKBP51 or FKBP52. The experimental evidence demonstrates that the neurotrophic actions of FK506 are the consequence of its binding to FKBP52, whereas FK506 interaction with the close-related partner immunophilin FKBP51 antagonises the function of FKBP52. Importantly, our study also demonstrates that other immunophilins do not replace FKBP52. It is concluded that the final biological response is the resulting outcome of the drug binding to both immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, the latter being the one that commands the dominant neurotrophic action in vivo.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Subsequent to treatment with FK506-conditioned medium (CM), the length of neuronal cells increased 61.06% on the first day, and increased 56.4% on the third day compared with those of C-CM group. Furthermore, addition of anti-EGF neutralizing antibodies could interrupt the promotion of neurite outgrowth by FK506-CM. The present study indicates that astrocytes have an important role as mediators of FK506-improved spinal cord function recovery, and this partially clarifies the role of cell-cell interaction through modulating EGF in this process.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

In order to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in such a process, an in vitro neuroproteomic-systems biology platform was developed in which the pan-proteomic profile of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cell line ND7/23 DRG was assessed in a large array of culture conditions using RhoAi and/or conditioned media obtained from SCI ex vivo derived spinal cord slices. A fine mapping of the spatio-temporal molecular events of the RhoAi treatment in SCI was performed. The data obtained allow a better understanding of regeneration/degeneration induced above and below the lesion site. Results notably showed a time-dependent alteration of the transcription factors profile along with the synthesis of growth cone-related factors (receptors, ligands, and signaling pathways) in RhoAi treated DRG cells. Furthermore, we assessed in a rat SCI model the in vivo impact of RhoAi treatment administered in situ via alginate scaffold that was combined with FK506 delivery. The improved recovery of locomotion was detected only at the early postinjury time points, whereas after overall survival a dramatic increase of synaptic contacts on outgrowing neurites in affected segments was observed. We validate these results by in vivo proteomic studies along the spinal cord segments from tissue and secreted media analyses, confirming the increase of the synaptogenesis expression factors under RhoAi treatment. Taken together, we demonstrate that RhoAi treatment seems to be useful to stimulate neurite outgrowth in both in vitro as well in vivo environments. However, for in vivo experiments there is a need for sustained delivery regiment to facilitate axon regeneration and promote synaptic reconnections with appropriate target neurons also at chronic phase, which in turn may lead to higher assumption for functional improvement.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Young adult male rats were subjected to experimental SCI by weight compression method. Minocycline (50mg/kg) and FK506 (1mg/kg) were administered orally in combination and individually to the SCI group daily for three weeks. During these three weeks, the recovery was measured using behavioral motor parameters (including BBB, Tarlov and other scorings) every other day for 29days after SCI. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the segment of the spinal cord centered at the injury site was removed for the histopathological studies as well as for biochemical analysis of monoamines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and some oxidative stress indices, such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), total glutathione (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). All behavioral results indicated that both drugs induced significant recovery from SCI with respect to time. The biochemical and histopathological results supported the behavioral findings, revealing significant recovery in the regeneration of the injured spinal tissues, the monoamine levels, and the oxidative stress indices. Overall, the effects of the tested drugs for SCI recovery were as follows: FK506+minocycline>minocycline>FK506 in all studied parameters. Thus, minocycline and FK506 may prove to be a potential therapy cocktail to treat acute SCI. However, further studies are warranted.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Because distinct differences exist in the neuroanatomy and immunological responses between rodents and primates, it is critical to determine the effectiveness and safety of allografted embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NS/PCs (ESC-NS/PCs) in a nonhuman primate SCI model. In the present study, common marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group). In the control group, phosphate-buffered saline was injected instead of cells. In the presence of a low-dose of tacrolimus, several grafted cells survived without tumorigenicity and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Significant differences were found in the transverse areas of luxol fast blue-positive myelin sheaths, neurofilament-positive axons, corticospinal tract fibers, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive vessels at the lesion epicenter between the transplantation and control groups. Immunoelectron microscopic examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control group. In addition, a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay indicated that ESC-NS/PCs modulated the allogeneic immune rejection. Taken together, our results indicate that allogeneic transplantation of ESC-NS/PCs from a nonhuman primate promoted functional recovery after SCI without tumorigenicity. This study demonstrates that allogeneic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) promoted functional recovery after transplantation into the injured spinal cord in nonhuman primates. ESC-NS/PCs were chosen because ESC-NS/PCs are one of the controls for induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NS/PCs and because ESC derivatives are possible candidates for clinical use. This translational research using an allograft model of a nonhuman primate is critical for clinical application of grafting NS/PCs derived from various allogeneic pluripotent stem cells, especially induced pluripotent stem cells, into injured spinal cord at the subacute phase.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

However, beneficial effects of iPSC-based therapy have so far been produced mostly using genetically immunodeficient rodents. Because of the long time required for generation and characterization of iPSCs, the use of autologous iPSCs for treating patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is not feasible. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to investigate the effect of iPSC-based therapy on functional recovery after SCI using pharmacologically immunosuppressed, immunocompetent animal models. Here we studied the functional outcome following subacute transplantation of human iPSC-derived NPCs into contused mouse spinal cord when tacrolimus was used as an immunosuppressive agent. We show that human iPSC-derived NPCs transplanted into pharmacologically immunosuppressed C57BL/6J mice exhibited poor long-term survival and failed to improve functional recovery after SCI as measured by Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) for locomotion and CatWalk gait analysis when compared to vehicle-treated animals. The scarce effect of iPSC-based therapy observed in the current study may be attributable to insufficient immunosuppressive effect, provided by monotherapy with tacrolimus in combination with immunogenicity of transplanted cells and complex microenvironment of the injured spinal cord. Our results highlight the importance of extensive preclinical studies of transplanted cells before the clinical application of iPSC-based cell therapy is achieved.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

The limited survival of the engrafted cells may determine the therapy success. Therefore, we compared two strategies to increase the presence of the cells in the injured spinal cord in rats: increasing the amount of MSC transplants and using immunosuppressive treatment with FK506 after transplantation. Functional outcomes for locomotion and electrophysiological responses were assessed. The grafted cells survival and the amount of cavity and spared tissue were studied. The findings indicate that immunosuppression improved grafted cells survival. A cell-dose effect was found regarding locomotion recovery and tissue protection independent of immunosuppression. Nevertheless, immunosuppression enhanced the electrophysiological outcomes and allowed filling of the cavity formed after injury by new regenerative tissue and axons. These results indicate that MSC transplantation combined with immunosuppression prolongs the survival of engrafted cells and improves functional and morphological outcomes after SCI.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

The model of spinal cord ischemia was prepared by means of catheterization through femoral artery and balloon dilatation. IR group underwent reperfusion 20 min after spinal cord ischemia.

Fluoro spectro photometry was employed to detect the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in injured spinal cord segment at 15 minutes after reperfusion. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were determined at 15 minutes, 1, 6, and 24 hours after reperfusion respectively. BBB scale was conducted to evaluate hindlimb motor function at 14 days after reperfusion. The level of ROS in TP group was significantly lower than that in IR group at 15 minutes after reperfusion. The activity of SOD was significantly higher in TP group than in IR group at all observational time points, while the activities of CAT and GSH-PX were significantly higher in TP group than in IR group at 1 and 6 hours after reperfusion. The content of MDA in TP group was significantly less than that in IR group at all observational time points. The motor function score of TP group was significantly superior to that of IR group at 14 days after reperfusion.

These compounds alter immunophilin ligand signaling pathways, which are known to interact downstream with mediators for human neural stem cell (hNSC) differentiation and proliferation, suggesting that immunosuppressants may directly alter hNSC properties. We investigated whether immunosuppressants can exert direct effects on the differentiation, proliferation, survival, and migration of human central nervous system-derived stem cells propagated as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) in vitro and in an in vivo model of spinal cord injury. We identified unique, immunosuppressant-dependent effects on hCNS-SCns differentiation and proliferation in vitro. All immunosuppressants tested increased neuronal differentiation, and CsA and rapamycin inhibited proliferation in vitro. No immunosuppressant-mediated effects on hCNS-SCns survival or migration in vitro were detected. These data suggested that immunosuppressant administration could alter hCNS-SCns properties in vivo. We tested this hypothesis by administering immunosuppressants to constitutively immunodeficient spinal cord injured mice and assessed survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of hCNS-SCns after 14 weeks. In parallel, we administered immunosuppressants to immunocompetent spinal cord injury (SCI) mice and also evaluated hCNS-SCns engraftment and fate. We identified no effect of immunosuppressants on the overall hCNS-SCns fate profile in either xenotransplantation model. Despite a lower level of human cell engraftment in immunocompetent SCI mice, functional locomotor recovery was observed in animals receiving hCNS-SCns transplantation with no evidence of allodynia. These data suggest that local cues in the microenvironment could exert a stronger influence on hCNS-SCns than circulating levels of immunosuppressants; however, differences between human and rodent metabolism/pharmokinetics and xenograft versus allograft paradigms could be determining factors.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Here we characterized the effect of intraspinal grafting of clinical grade human fetal spinal cord-derived neural stem cells (HSSC) on the recovery of neurological function in a rat model of acute lumbar (L3) compression injury. Three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received L3 spinal compression injury. Three days post-injury, animals were randomized and received intraspinal injections of either HSSC, media-only, or no injections. All animals were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone acetate from the day of cell grafting and survived for eight weeks. Motor and sensory dysfunction were periodically assessed using open field locomotion scoring, thermal/tactile pain/escape thresholds and myogenic motor evoked potentials. The presence of spasticity was measured by gastrocnemius muscle resistance and electromyography response during computer-controlled ankle rotation. At the end-point, gait (CatWalk), ladder climbing, and single frame analyses were also assessed. Syrinx size, spinal cord dimensions, and extent of scarring were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Differentiation and integration of grafted cells in the host tissue were validated with immunofluorescence staining using human-specific antibodies. Intraspinal grafting of HSSC led to a progressive and significant improvement in lower extremity paw placement, amelioration of spasticity, and normalization in thermal and tactile pain/escape thresholds at eight weeks post-grafting. No significant differences were detected in other CatWalk parameters, motor evoked potentials, open field locomotor (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotion score (BBB)) score or ladder climbing test. Magnetic resonance imaging volume reconstruction and immunofluorescence analysis of grafted cell survival showed near complete injury-cavity-filling by grafted cells and development of putative GABA-ergic synapses between grafted and host neurons. Peri-acute intraspinal grafting of HSSC can represent an effective therapy which ameliorates motor and sensory deficits after traumatic spinal cord injury.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Forty-eight rats were subjected to a weight-drop contusion at the tenth thoracic level (a 10-g rod dropped from a height of 25 mm).

Functional recovery was evaluated during 42 days after SCI via open-field test, inclined plane test, footprint analysis, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and electron microscopic analysis. Rats from three treatment groups showed significantly better locomotor functional outcomes, higher SSEP amplitude, shorter SSEP latency, and milder pathological changes compared with those of control group. Moreover, rats treated with a combination of FTY720 and tacrolimus demonstrated significantly greater functional recovery by day 14 after SCI than those treated with either FTY720 or tacrolimus alone.

In partial spinal cord injury, combination of an OEC graft and FK506 reduced functional deficits evaluated by the BBB score, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and H reflex tests, diminished cavitation, astrogliosis and increased sparing/regeneration of raphespinal fibers compared to untreated and single-treatment groups of rats. After complete spinal cord transection, the combined treatment significantly improved functional outcomes, promoted axonal regeneration caudal to the lesion, and diminished astrogliosis compared only to non-transplanted animals. Slightly, but non-significant, better functional and histological results were found in OEC-grafted animals treated with FK506 than in those given saline after spinal cord transection. Nevertheless, the combined treatment increased the percentage of rats that recovered MEPs and promoted a significant reduction in astrogliosis.

In this study, the authors evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive medications on neurite outgrowth and cell survival after a pharmacologically induced injury. Differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were injured using the calcium agonist thapsigargin. After cellular injury, neurite outgrowth in the presence or absence of immunosuppressive agents was measured. Apoptosis was quantified with the aid of a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay. Neurite outgrowth was severely restricted following thapsigargin injury. Outgrowth was potentiated, however, by the addition of concentrations of 1 and 10 mM cyclosporin A in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, addition of 10 nM FK506 increased the percentage of neurites in the 20- to 40-micron range. A low dose (1 mM) of dexamethasone did not have a significant effect on neurite outgrowth, but a higher dose (10 mM) increased the percentage of neurites in the 10- to 45-micron range. These agents also lessened the degree of thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and dexamethasone can potentiate neurite outgrowth and protect against apoptotic cell death in a human postmitotic neuronal cell line.

Rats were given daily subcutaneous injections of either FK506 (2 mg/kg/day), FK1706 (2 mg/kg/day), an equivalent volume of saline or 30% DMSO as vehicle, respectively. Functional recovery was assessed using a modified Tarlov/Klinger scale, walking along progressively narrower wooden beams (7.7-1.7 cm widths), and analysis of footprints obtained during walking. Compared to both control groups, FK506 and FK1706-treated animals demonstrated significant functional recovery 4 days (beam walking), 2 weeks (footprints), and 4 weeks (Tarlov/Klinger scale). By 11 weeks, FK506-treated and FK1706-treated animals were able to walk, albeit poorly, along even the narrowest (1.7 cm) beam. At 11 weeks, the spinal cords were re-exposed and a small piece of gel foam-soaked Fluoro-Gold was placed on the injured side 2-cm caudal to the first injury. Five days later, the animals were perfused and tissues prepared for fluorescence microscopy. FK506-treated and FK1706-treated rats demonstrate a significantly greater number of retrogradely labeled neurons in the red nucleus. The results implicate a nonimmunosuppressant mechanism in FK506's action and suggest that FK506 or a nonimmunosuppressant derivative may be useful for treatment of spinal cord injuries.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Acute spinal cord injury model was made with the Allen technique. Animals were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group A (n = 8) was the control group and received operation but no therapy, while group B and C (n = 8) received a single dose of FK506 (0.18 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively) administered with an arterial duct 2 h after spinal cord injury (SCI). Spine MRI, neurological function, histopathological examination of injured spinal cord and immunohistochemical examination of expression of NF(200) in neurons and GFAP in astrocytes were assessed at certain time after injury. Neurological function score of group C and B was better than that of group A (P < 0.05), with significance between group C and A, while no significance between group B and A statistically. The signal scope of spinal cord injury on MRI in group C was the smallest among all the groups, and the signal scope in group B was smaller than that in group A, which was directively associated with the neurological outcome. The expression of NF and GFAP was significantly higher in group C than in group A (P < 0.05), but without statistical significance between group B and A. Local administration of FK506 (0.3 mg/kg) possesses neuroprotective effect on acute spinal cord injury, which can improve neurological function recovery and attenuate secondary spinal cord injury.

An additional group received an initial bolus of FK 506 (2 mg/kg) followed by daily injections (0.2 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Functional recovery was evaluated using open-field walking, inclined plane tests, motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and the H-reflex response during 14 days postoperation (dpo). Tissue sparing and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), biotinylated tomato lectin LEC, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) immunoreactivity were quantified in the injured spinal cord. FK 506-treated animals demonstrated significantly better neurologic outcome, higher MEP amplitudes, and lower H-wave amplitude compared to that of saline-treated rats. In contrast, administration of MP did not result in significant differences with respect to the saline-treated group. Histologic examination revealed that tissue sparing was largest in FK 506-treated compared to saline and MP-treated animals. GFAP and COX-2 reactivity was decreased in animals treated with FK 506 compared to that in animals given MP or saline, whereas IL-1 beta expression was similarly reduced in both FK 506- and MP-treated groups. Microglia/macrophage response was reduced in FK 506 and MP-injected animals at 3 dpo, but only in MP-treated animals at 7 dpo with respect to saline-injected rats. Repeated administrations of FK 506 improved functional and histologic results to a greater degree than did a single bolus of FK 506. The results indicate that FK 506 administration protects the damaged spinal cord and should be considered as potential therapy for treating spinal cord injuries.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Peripheral nerve damage also leads to permanent neurological deficits, but neurological recovery can be relatively good, especially if the ends of a transected nerve are anastomosed soon after the injury. The time until recovery generally depends on the distance the axons must regenerate to their targets. Neurological recovery following the destruction of a length of a peripheral nerve requires a graft to bridge the gap that is permissive to, and promotes, axon regeneration. But neurological recovery is slow and limited, especially for gaps longer than 1.5 cm, even using autologous peripheral nerve grafts. Without a reliable means of bridging long nerve gaps, such injuries commonly result in amputations. Promoting extensive neurological recovery requires techniques that simultaneously provide protection to injured neurons and increase the numbers of neurons that extend axons, while inducing more rapid and extensive axon regeneration across long nerve gaps. Although conduits filled with various materials enhance axon regeneration across short nerve gaps, pure sensory nerve graft remains the gold standard for use across long nerve gaps, even though they lead to only limited neurological recovery. Consistent results demonstrate that several immunosuppressive agents enhance the number of axons and the rate at which they regenerate. This review examines the roles played by immunosuppressants, especially FK506, with primary focus on its role as a neuroprotectant and neurotrophic agent, and its potential clinical use to promote improved neurological recovery following peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

The specific pathways in this cascade are myriad and the importance each one plays is controversial. It is clear, though, that blocking individual pathways confers protection to these tissues. In the present study we examined the role of Cyclosporin A (CsA), FK-506 and rapamycin in modulating the effects of Ca(2+) influx through their interactions with immunophilins and specifically the end result of calcineurin modulation. Dorsal columns were isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats and injured by exposure to hypoxic conditions for 60 minutes. The samples were monitored electrophysiologically in an in vitro recording chamber (maintained at 37 C degrees ) during injury, and the compound action potential (CAP) was monitored with glass microelectrodes. The dorsal column was exposed to hypoxic Ringers solution alone or with the different immunosuppressants and compared with baseline readings. Functional recovery of the dorsal column was then assessed by recovery of the CAP. The mean CAP decreased to about 20% of baseline control levels during hypoxia and returned 53.8+/-7.6% of baseline (p<.05) after reoxygenation. CsA, an immunosuppressant known to inhibit calcineurin, promoted a significantly greater recovery of CAP amplitude to 76.8+/-5.2% and 72.1+/-13.2% of control (p<.05) after hypoxic injury and reoxygenation of dorsal column white matter when applied at concentrations of 1 microM and 10 microM, respectively. FK-506, which also inhibits calcineurin, was applied at a concentration of 0.1 microM, and promoted CAP amplitude recovery to 82.6+/-5.0% of control after hypoxic injury and reoxygenation of dorsal column white matter. The addition of rapamycin (1 microM), which binds to the same immunophilin as FK-506, to the FK-506 (0.1 microM) solution during hypoxic injury showed recovery of CAP amplitudes to only 56.9+/-6.7% of control. Electron microscopy revealed remarkable protection of axons and prevention of organelle disruption in segments treated with CsA and FK-506 during hypoxia when compared with hypoxic controls. In conclusion, both CsA and FK-506 confer in vitro protection to dorsal columns during hypoxic injury at physiological temperatures, and rapamycin blocks the protective effect of FK-506. Thus, calcineurin may play an important role in the physiology of neuronal injury.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Myriad treatment modalities, including corticosteroids, 21-aminosteroids, opioid receptor antagonists, gangliosides, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TRH analogs, antioxidants and free radical scavengers, calcium channel blockers, magnesium replacement therapy, sodium channel blockers, N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-kainate receptor antagonists, modulators of arachadonic acid metabolism, neurotrophic growth factors, serotonin antagonists, antibodies against inhibitors of axonal regeneration, potassium channel blockers (4-aminopyridine), paclitaxel, clenbuterol, progesterone, gabexate mesylate, activated protein C, caspase inhibitors, tacrolimus, antibodies against adhesion molecules, and other immunomodulatory therapy have been studied to date. Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment. This first decade of the new millennium, now touted as the Decade of the Spine, will hopefully witness the emergence of universal and efficacious pharmacologic therapy and ultimately a cure for SCI.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Experimental groups were as follows: sham-operation; control, receiving only vehicle; FK506 A, receiving FK506 (1 mg/kg IV) before clamping; and FK506 B, receiving FK506 (1 mg/kg IV) at the onset of reperfusion. Neurologic status was assessed at 24 h and then daily up to 96 h with a 0 to 6 scale (0, normal function; 6, severe paraplegia). Rats were randomly killed at 24, 48, or 96 h, and spinal cords were harvested for histopathology. Physiologic variables did not differ significantly among experimental groups. All control rats suffered severe and definitive paraplegia. FK506-treated rats had significantly better neurologic outcome compared with control. Histopathologic analysis disclosed severe injury in the lumbar gray matter of all control rats, whereas most FK506-treated rats had less injury. These data suggest that FK506 can improve neurologic recovery and attenuate spinal cord injury induced by transient thoracic aortic cross-clamping. A single dose-injection of the immunosuppressant FK506 significantly improved neurologic outcome and attenuated spinal cord injury induced by transient thoracic aortic cross-clamping in the rat.","tacrolimus","pubmed"

Nitric oxide (NO) functions as a retrograde neurotransmitter in the spinal cord, and postsynaptic structures respond to NO by producing cGMP.

The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the effects of the use of both methylprednisolone and tadalafil on serum and tissue concentrations of NO, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and tissue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in Wistar albino rats by dropping a 10 g rod from a 5.0 cm height at T8-10. The 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: tadalafil, methylprednisolone, non-treatment and sham groups. Rats were neurologically tested at 24 hours after trauma. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p<0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p<0.05). The increase in serum SOD levels was greater in the tadalafil group than the methylprednisolone group. Serum MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group (p>0.05). Tissue MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group and sham groups (p>0.05). Although there was no difference in neurological outcome scores between the tadalafil, methylprednisolone and non-treatment groups (p>0.05), the animals in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to have better scores than the non-treatment group. Thus, tadalafil appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of injury to the spinal cord by increasing tissue levels of NO and serum activity of SOD.","tadalafil","pubmed"

In these mouse models, Cre-recombination is not induced until tamoxifen is administered, which allows researchers to have temporal control of genetic modifications. Interestingly, tamoxifen has been identified as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury patients due to its neuroprotective properties. It is also reparative in that it stimulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, it is unknown whether tamoxifen is neuroprotective and neuroreparative when administration is delayed after SCI. To properly interpret data from transgenic mice in which tamoxifen treatment is delayed after SCI, it is necessary to identify the effects of tamoxifen alone on anatomical and functional recovery. In this study, female and male mice received a moderate mid-thoracic spinal cord contusion. Mice were then gavaged with corn oil or a high dose of tamoxifen from 19-22 days post-injury, and sacrificed 42 days post-injury. All mice underwent behavioral testing for the duration of the study, which revealed that tamoxifen treatment did not impact hindlimb motor recovery. Similarly, histological analyses revealed that tamoxifen had no effect on white matter sparing, total axon number, axon sprouting, glial reactivity, cell proliferation, oligodendrocyte number, or myelination, but tamoxifen did decrease the number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horn. Semi-thin sections confirmed that axon demyelination and remyelination were unaffected by tamoxifen. Sex-specific responses to tamoxifen were also assessed, and there were no significant differences between female and male mice. These data suggest that delayed tamoxifen administration after SCI does not change functional recovery or improve tissue sparing in female or male mice.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

When crossed with reporter mice, a significant amount of recombination was achieved (without tamoxifen treatment) in peripherally-projecting sensory, sympathetic, and motoneurons after peripheral nerve crush in hemizygotes (65-80% by 16 d) and was absent in uninjured neurons. Importantly, injury-induced recombination did not occur in Schwann cells distal to the injury, and with a knock-out-validated antibody we verified an absence of ATF3 expression. Functional recovery following sciatic nerve crush in ATF3-deficient mice (both hemizygotes and homozygotes) was delayed, indicating previously unreported haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we crossed the ATF3-CreERT2 line with a floxed phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) line and show significantly improved axonal regeneration, as well as more complete recovery of neuromuscular function. We also demonstrate the utility of the ATF3-CreERT2 hemizygous line by characterizing recombination after lateral spinal hemisection (C8/T1), which identified specific populations of ascending spinal cord neurons (including putative spinothalamic and spinocerebellar) and descending supraspinal neurons (rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and hypothalamic). We anticipate these mice will be valuable in distinguishing axotomized from uninjured neurons of several different classes (e.g., via reporter expression), and in probing the function of any number of genes as they relate to neuronal injury and regeneration.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

TAM reduced reactive gliosis during chronic stages and increased the expression of Olig-2. A significant difference was observed in estrogen receptor alpha between male and female rodents from 2 to 28 DPI suggesting a sexually dimorphic characteristic that could be related to the behavioral differences observed in the therapeutic window of TAM.

Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation.

The results showed that the numbers of the ipsilateral and contralateral ventral horn neurons were reduced to less than half in the nontreated animals compared with the treated ones. Also, axons myelin sheet was preserved to almost normal values in treated cats. On the contrary, in the untreated animals, their myelin sheet was reduced to 28% at 30 days after injury (DAI), in both the ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the spinal cord. Additionally, we made hindlimb kinematics experiments to study the effects of tamoxifen on cat locomotion after the injury: at 4, 16, and 30 DAI. We observed that the ipsilateral hindlimb angular displacement (AD) of the pendulum-like movements (PLM) during gait locomotion was recovered to almost normal values in treated cats. Contralateral PLM acquired similar values to those obtained in intact cats. At 4 DAI, untreated animals showed a compensatory increment of PLM occurring in the contralateral hindlimb, which was partially recovered at 30 DAI. Our findings indicate that tamoxifen exerts a neuroprotective effect and preserves or produces myelinated axons, which could benefit the locomotion recovery in injured cats.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

The initial physical impact triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generate a nonpermissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Spinal cord injured patients often arrive at the clinic hours after the initial insult. This indicates the need to study and develop treatments with a long therapeutic window of action and multiactive properties, which target the complex set of events that arise after the initial trauma. We provide evidence that tamoxifen (TAM), a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, exerts neuroprotective effects in an animal model when applied up-to 24 h after SCI. We hypothesized that continuous TAM administration will improve functional locomotor recovery by favoring myelin preservation and reducing secondary damage after SCI. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (∼230 g) received a moderate contusion to the thoracic (T9-T10) spinal cord, using the MASCIS impactor device. To determine the therapeutic window available for TAM treatment, rats were implanted with TAM pellets (15 mg) immediately or 24 h after SCI. Locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan open field test, grid walk, and beam crossing tests) was assessed weekly for 35 days post-injury. TAM-treated rats showed significant functional locomotor recovery and improved fine movements when treated immediately or 24 h after SCI. Further, TAM increased white matter preservation and reduced secondary damage caused by astrogliosis, axonal degeneration, and cell death after trauma. These results provide evidence for TAM as a potential therapeutic agent to treat SCI up to 24 h after the trauma.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

Many molecular and cellular events are triggered after the initial physical impact to the cord. Two major phases have been described in the field of SCI: an acute phase and late phase. Most of the therapeutic strategies are focused on the late phase because this provides an opportunity to target cellular events like apoptosis, demyelination, scar formation and axonal outgrowth. In this mini-review, we will focus on two agents (tamoxifen and a Src kinase family inhibitor known as PP2) that have been shown in our laboratory to produce neuroprotective (increase cell survival) and/or regenerative (axonal outgrowth) actions. The animal model used in our laboratory is adult female rat (~250 g) with a moderate contusion (12.5 mm) to the spinal cord at the T10 level, using the MASCIS impactor device. Tamoxifen or PP2 was administered by implantation of a 15 mg pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) or by intraperitoneal injections (1.5 mg/kg, every 3 days), respectively, to produce a long-term effect (28 days). Tamoxifen and the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, are drugs that in rats with a moderate spinal cord injury promote functional locomotor recovery, increase spared white matter tissue, and stimulate axonal outgrowth. Moreover, tamoxifen reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, these drugs are possible therapeutic agents that have a neuroprotective/regenerative activity in vertebrates with SCI.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

This scar contains reactive astrocytes, activated microglia, macrophages and other myeloid cells, meningeal cells, proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and a dense extracellular matrix. Whether the scar is beneficial or detrimental to recovery remains controversial. In the acute phase of recovery, scar-forming astrocytes limit the invasion of leukocytes and macrophages, but in the subacute and chronic phases of injury the glial scar is a physical and biochemical barrier to axonal regrowth. The signals that initiate the formation of the glial scar are unknown. Both canonical and noncanonical signaling Wnts are increased after spinal cord injury (SCI). Because Wnts are important regulators of OPC and oligodendrocyte development, we examined the role of canonical Wnt signaling in the glial reactions to CNS injury. In adult female mice carrying an OPC-specific conditionally deleted β-catenin gene, there is reduced proliferation of OPCs after SCI, reduced accumulation of activated microglia/macrophages, and reduced astrocyte hypertrophy. Using an infraorbital optic nerve crush injury, we show that reducing β-catenin-dependent signaling in OPCs creates an environment that is permissive to axonal regeneration. Viral-induced expression of Wnt3a in the normal adult mouse spinal cord induces an injury-like response in glia. Thus canonical Wnt signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce injury responses among glial cells. These data suggest that targeting Wnt expression after SCI may have therapeutic potential in promoting axon regeneration.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-α mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-α antagonist. We also observed that ER-α was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-α. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-α dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen׳s effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of TMX for SCI, we used proteomic analyses, Western blots and histological assays, which showed that TMX treatment spared mature oligodendrocytes/increased myelin levels and altered reactive astrocytes, including the upregulation of the water channels aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a novel finding. AQP4 increases in TMX-treated SCI rats were associated with smaller fluid-filled cavities with borders consisting of densely packed AQP4-expressing astrocytes that closely resemble the organization of normal glia limitans externa (in contrast to large cavities in control SCI rats that lacked glia limitans-like borders and contained reactive glial cells).

Glial scar is a barrier preventing the extent of damage but it has deleterious effects in the regeneration of the axons. Estradiol and tamoxifen reduce gliosis and have neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus and the spinal cord. We evaluated the proliferation of glia and the electrocorticogram in the sensorial cortex in a brain injury model. At seven days post-injury, estradiol, tamoxifen and estradiol plus tamoxifen reduced the number of resident and proliferative NG2 and reactive astrocyte vimentin+ cells. Estradiol and tamoxifen effects on NG2 cells could be produced by the classical oestrogen receptors found in these cells. The glial scar was also reduced by tamoxifen. At thirty days post-injury, the amount of resident and proliferative astrocytes increased significantly, except in the estradiol plus tamoxifen group, whilst the oligodendrocytes proliferation in the glial scar was reduced in treated animals. Tamoxifen promotes the survival of FOX-3+ neurons in the injured area and a recovery in the amplitude of electrocorticogram waves. At thirty days, estradiol did not favour the survival of neurons but produced a greater number of reactive astrocytes. In contrast, the number of oligodendrocytes was reduced. Tamoxifen could favour brain repair promoting neuron survival and adjusting glial cell number. It seems to recover adequate neural communication.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

To examine the role of this factor in remyelination and repair following nerve injury, we ablated neuregulin 1 in the adult nervous system using a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase transgenic mouse system. The loss of neuregulin 1 impaired remyelination after nerve crush, but did not affect Schwann cell proliferation associated with Wallerian degeneration or axon regeneration or the clearance of myelin debris by macrophages. Myelination changes were most marked at 10 days after injury but still apparent at 2 months post-crush. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated reduced expression of myelin-related genes during nerve repair in animals lacking neuregulin 1. We also studied repair over a prolonged time course in a more severe injury model, sciatic nerve transection and reanastamosis. In the neuregulin 1 mutant mice, remyelination was again impaired 2 months after nerve transection and reanastamosis. However, by 3 months post-injury axons lacking neuregulin 1 were effectively remyelinated and virtually indistinguishable from control. Neuregulin 1 signalling is therefore an important factor in nerve repair regulating the rate of remyelination and functional recovery at early phases following injury. In contrast to development, however, the determination of myelination fate following nerve injury is not dependent on axonal neuregulin 1 expression. In the early phase following injury, axonal neuregulin 1 therefore promotes nerve repair, but at late stages other signalling pathways appear to compensate.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

Blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability, tissue edema formation, microglial activation, neuronal cell death and myelin loss were determined in rats subjected to spinal cord contusion. The results showed that tamoxifen, administered at 30 min post-injury, significantly decreased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production induced by microglial activation, alleviated the amount of Evans blue leakage and edema formation. In addition, tamoxifen treatment clearly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons post-SCI. The myelin loss and the increase in production of myelin-associated axonal growth inhibitors were also found to be significantly attenuated at day 3 post-injury. Furthermore, rats treated with tamoxifen scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI than did vehicle-treated rats, suggesting improved functional outcome after SCI. Together, these results demonstrate that tamoxifen provides neuroprotective effects for treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability, and is therefore a potential neuroprotectant for human spinal cord injury therapy.","tamoxifen","pubmed"

Histological analysis showed that NRP/GRP survived, filled the lesion site, differentiated into neurons and glia, and migrated selectively. Volume of spinal cord spared was increased in NRP/GRP recipients, suggesting local protection. Bladder areflexia developed in both operated groups, but NRP/GRP recipients exhibited an accelerated recovery, with decreased micturition pressure and fewer episodes of detrusor hyperreflexia. Because noradrenergic receptors proliferate after spinal injury and descending noradrenergic pathways contribute to regulation of bladder control, we examined the effects of administering an alpha-1A-adrenergic antagonist, Tamsulosin, on urodynamics. This improved all cystometric parameters in both operated groups, and micturition pressure in NRP/GRP rats recovered to normal levels. Both operated groups initially showed increased sensitivity to a thermal stimulus applied to the tail; the NRP/GRP rats showed significant improvement over time. NRP/GRP grafts also produced greater recovery of hindlimb function in several tests, although both groups showed persistent and similar deficits in locomotion on a grid. Because bladder, hindlimb, and tail sensory and motor functions are organized through lumbosacral cord, we examined descending and primary afferent projections at L6-S1. The density of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and corticotrophin releasing factor-positive fibers increased in the NRP/GRP group compared with OP-controls, suggesting some sparing and/or sprouting of these modulatory pathways. Immunocytochemical staining density of dorsal root axons in the dorsal horn increased in the OP-controls but appeared normal in the NRP/GRP group. Synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the lumbosacral dorsal horn was similar among groups, consistent with restoration of synaptic density in both groups of operated animals but by different pathways. We suggest that local protection provided by NRP/GRP resulted in increased sparing/sprouting of descending pathways, which prevented sprouting by dorsal root axons, and that this modification in lumbosacral circuitry contributes to the recovery of function.","tamsulosin","pubmed"

Thus, we are going to screen the effectiveness of telmisartan in SCI for the development of it in clinical application. In the present study, we used compressive SCI in rats. Telmisartan was then used to evaluate the influence in rats after SCI. Change in PPARδ expression was identified by Western blots. Also, behavioral tests were performed to check the recovery of damage. Recovery of damage from SCI was observed in telmisartan-treated rats. Additionally, this action of telmisartan was inhibited by GSK0660 at the dose sufficient to block PPARδ. However, metformin at the dose enough to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase failed to produce similar action as telmisartan. Thus, mediation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in this action of telmisartan can be rule out. Moreover, telmisartan reversed the expressions of PPARδ in rats with SCI. The obtained data suggest that telmisartan can improve the damage of SCI in rats through an increase in PPARδ expression. Thus, telmisartan is useful to be developed as an agent in the therapy of SCI.","telmisartan","pubmed"

Patients with SCI usually exhibit severe clinical symptoms, including sensory and motor dysfunction below the injured levels, paraplegia, quadriplegia and urinary retention, which can exacerbate the substantial medical and social burdens. The major pathological change observed in SCI is inflammatory reaction, which induces demyelination, axonal degeneration, and the apoptosis and necrosis of neurons. Traditional medical treatments are mainly focused on the recovery of motor function and prevention of complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of SCI and have proposed lots of effective treatments, but the clinical applications are still limited due to the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis after SCI. Endocrine hormones are kinds of molecules that are synthesized by specialized endocrine organs and can participate in the regulation of multiple physiological activities, and their protective effects on several disorders have been widely discussed. In addition, many studies have identified that endocrine hormones can promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery in individuals with central nervous system diseases. Therefore, studies investigating the clinical applications of endocrine hormones as treatments for SCI are necessary. In this review, we described the neuroprotective roles of several endocrine hormones in SCI; endocrine hormone administration reduces cell death and promotes functional repair after SCI. We also proposed novel therapies for SCI.","testosterone","pubmed"

When determining how sex affects SCI it remains imperative to expand outcomes beyond locomotor recovery and consider other complications plaguing the quality of life of patients with SCI.

We discuss the unique caveats this creates to the translatability of preclinical research in the SCI field.

TE alone (7.0 mg/week) suppressed bone resorption, attenuated cancellous bone loss, constrained the soleus fiber-type transition, and prevented LABC atrophy. In comparison, TE+TM concomitantly suppressed bone resorption and stimulated bone formation after SCI, produced near-complete cancellous bone preservation, prevented the soleus fiber-type transition, attenuated soleus fCSA atrophy, maintained soleus force production, and increased LABC mass. 75% of SCI+TE+TM animals recovered voluntary over-ground hindlimb stepping, while no SCI and only 20% of SCI+TE animals regained stepping ability.

This study aims to examine the effect of daily 60-minute locomotor training and exercise in general on sexual function in a rat SCI contusion model. Male Wistar rats received a T9 contusion SCI. Animals were randomized into 4 groups: a quadrupedal stepping group (SCI + QT), a forelimb-only exercise group (SCI + FT), a non-trained harnessed group (SCI + NT), and a home cage non-trained group (SCI + HC). The 2 non-trained groups were combined (SCI) post hoc. Daily training sessions were 60 minutes in duration for 8 weeks. Urine samples were collected during bi-weekly 24-hour metabolic cage behavioral testing. Latency, numbers of penile dorsiflexion, and glans cupping were recorded during bi-weekly penile dorsiflexion reflex (PDFR) testing. Terminal electromyography (EMG) recordings of the bulbospongiosus muscle (BSM) were recorded in response to stimulation of the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP). ABT after SCI had a significant effect on PDFR, as well as BSM EMG latency and burst duration. SCI causes a significant decrease in the latency to onset of PDFR. After 8 weeks of ABT, SCI + QT animals had a significantly increased latency relative to the post-SCI baseline. BSM EMG response to DNP stimulation had a significantly decreased latency and increase in average and maximum amplitude in SCI + QT animals. SCI animals had a significantly longer burst duration than trained animals. Time between PDFR events, penile dorsiflexion, glans cupping, and urine testosterone were not affected by ABT. ABT has a positive influence on sexual function and provides a potential therapy to enhance the efficacy of current sexual dysfunction therapies in the male SCI population. Several significant small improvements in sexual function were found in a clinically relevant rat model of SCI using a readily available rehabilitative therapy. The limited findings could reflect insensitivity of the PDFR as a measure of erectile function. These results indicate that task-specific stepping and/or loading provide sensory input to the spinal cord impacting the neural circuitry responsible for sexual function.

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone.","testosterone","pubmed"

We previously demonstrated that motoneurons and the muscles they innervate show pronounced atrophy after SCI, and these changes are prevented by treatment with testosterone. Here, we assessed whether the testosterone active metabolites estradiol and dihydrotestosterone have similar protective effects after SCI. Young adult female rats received either sham or T9 spinal cord contusion injuries and were treated with estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, both, or nothing via Silastic capsules. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor testing was performed weekly and voiding behavior was assessed at 3 weeks post-injury. Four weeks after SCI, lesion volume and tissue sparing, quadriceps muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and motoneuron dendritic morphology were assessed. Spontaneous locomotor behavior improved after SCI, but hormone treatments had no effect. Voiding behavior was disrupted after SCI, but was significantly improved by treatment with either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone; combined treatment was maximally effective. Treatment with estradiol reduced lesion volume, but dihydrotestosterone alone and estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone were ineffective. SCI-induced decreases in motoneuron dendritic length were attenuated by all hormone treatments. SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were prevented by treatment with either dihydrotestosterone or estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone, but estradiol treatment was ineffective. These findings suggest that deficits in micturition and regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology seen after SCI are ameliorated by treatment with estradiol or dihydrotestosterone, further supporting a role for steroid hormones as neurotherapeutic agents in the injured nervous system.","testosterone","pubmed"

Previous studies have shown a role for testosterone in this process, but the role of estrogen is unknown. To evaluate the role of estrogen signaling in treadmill exercise, we blocked estrogen receptor (ER) signaling during treadmill exercise in males and female wild type mice. The right common fibular (CF) branch of the sciatic nerve was cut and repaired with fibrin glue that contained the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Estradiol-filled or blank Silastic capsules were implanted subcutaneously at the time of nerve transection. Starting three days post-transection, exercised mice received treadmill training using the paradigm appropriate to their sex 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Fourteen days after the initial nerve transection, motoneurons whose axons had regenerated at least 1.5 mm distal to the original cut sites were labeled with a retrograde tracer. Regeneration was quantified by counting the number of fluorescent labeled motoneurons in the lumbar region of the spinal cord. Both treadmill training and estradiol administration increased the number of motoneurons participating in axon regeneration, but these effects were blocked by ER antagonist treatment.

Males with SCI tend to be injured at an earlier age, mostly during sports or motor vehicle accidents, whereas females tend be injured later in life, particularly in the age group 65 and older. In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females. Similar controversy exists clinically, in studies that have examined gender disparities in outcome after SCI. The current review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for a gender bias in outcome following SCI and discusses issues that have made it difficult to conclusively answer this question.","testosterone","pubmed"

As such, even routine prehospital administration becomes extremely feasible for a myriad of conditions. More importantly, the worldwide magnitude of potential patients who could benefit is profound. Even if estrogen only changes the outcome in a relatively small percentage of applicable cases, the potential impact may still be of dramatic proportions in terms of the absolute number of lives saved and the resources spared worldwide. Resources may be spared not only in terms of diminishing the economic impact of death and long-term disability, but also in terms of preventing extended intensive care unit stays and treatment of preventable complications that result in longer recovery.","testosterone","pubmed"

We depleted SNB motoneurons on one side only of the spinal cord by unilateral intramuscular injection of a retrogradely transported form of saporin, and examined the morphology of contralateral SNB motoneurons. Motoneuron morphology was assessed in normal control males, gonadally intact saporin-treated males, and saporin-treated males who had been castrated 6 weeks previously and given testosterone replacement beginning at the time of saporin injection. Untreated castrated males served as an additional control group. Four weeks after saporin treatment, SNB motoneurons contralateral to the saporin injection were retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the cholera toxin B subunit and reconstructed in three dimensions. In gonadally intact males, unilateral motoneuron depletion caused regressive changes in contralateral SNB motoneurons: Soma size and dendritic length were both decreased. However, testosterone manipulation (i.e., castration followed by testosterone replacement) completely prevented the dendritic retraction.

In this study, we extended those studies to another injury model and asked the following question: Will T treatment accelerate recovery from lower limb paralysis following sciatic nerve crush in the rat? METHODS: Castrated adult male rats received a right side sciatic nerve crush at the level of the sciatic notch, with the left side serving as control. Half the animals received a subcutaneous implant of a propionated form of T (TP), the others were sham-implanted. Weekly testing using the Sciatic Functional Index (SFI), a quantitative measure of locomotion, was done for 7 weeks postoperative (wpo). RESULTS: Between 3 and 5 weeks post-op, the average SFI score of the TP-treated group was higher than controls. This difference was significant at 4 wpo, indicating an accelerated degree of functional recovery. At these timepoints, the differences were attributable to the footprint or paw length and associated with calf muscle reinnervation rather than the toespreading component associated with intrinsic foot muscle rein-nervation. Beyond 5 wpo, there were no differences in the SFI scores. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that, as with facial nerve regeneration in the hamster, testosterone accelerates functional recovery from hind limb paralysis following sciatic nerve injury in the rat. While the responses of spinal motoneurons to injury can differ from those of cranial motoneurons, in this case it appears that they share a similar response to the trophic actions of androgen. This is important in the context of designing therapeutic strategies for dealing with direct trauma to motoneurons resulting from both peripheral and central nervous system trauma, such as spinal cord injury.","testosterone","pubmed"

This sexual dimorphism is wiped out and recovery is worse in adult mice deprived of mature T cells. After spinal cord contusion in adult rats, functional recovery (measured by locomotor scores in an open field) was significantly worse in females treated with dihydrotestosterone prior to the injury than in placebo-treated controls, and significantly better in castrated males than in their noncastrated male littermates. Post-traumatic administration of the testosterone receptor antagonist flutamide promoted the functional recovery in adult male rats. These results, in line with the known inhibitory effect of testosterone on cell-mediated immunity, suggest that androgen-mediated immunosuppression plays a role in ISCI-related immune dysfunction and can therefore partly explain the worse outcome of ISCI in males than in female. We suggest that females, which are more prone to develop autoimmune response than males, benefit from this response in cases of CNS insults.","testosterone","pubmed"

In this study, we examined the long-term (>4 weeks) effects of SCI on spermatogenesis and its recovery. Results of this study reveal that while serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone levels in SCI rats recovered within 1 month after the injury, their spermatogenesis continued to regress. By 3 months, spermatogenesis in 70% of SCI rats has totally regressed, characterized by the absence of proliferating spermatogonia; these effects could not be prevented by an otherwise effective regimen of testosterone treatment. Sertoli cells in the regressed seminiferous tubules exhibited unusual behavior, characterized by the formation of multiple cell layers and/or aggregates that extended into the tubular lumen. Active spermatogenesis was observed in nine of the 19 SCI rats by 6 months, seven of which had complete spermatogenesis, but with persisting abnormalities. These results demonstrate that SCI results in total, but reversible, regression of spermatogenesis. Failure to prevent such effects by an otherwise effective exogenous testosterone regimen suggests that non-endocrine factors are involved in the SCI effects on spermatogenesis. The unusual Sertoli cell localization in the regressed testes may have been triggered by the loss of proliferating spermatogonia and may be involved in subsequent spermatogenic recovery.","testosterone","pubmed"

In addition to androgen, a normal innervation of the prostate is believed to be important for maintaining normal function of the prostate. Previously we noted that, in the rat, the weight of the prostate decreased following surgically induced spinal cord injury (SCI). This observation suggests that growth, and possibly function, of the prostate may be compromised after SCI. To explore this possibility, we examined the effects of SCI on the androgen-related biochemical properties and morphology of the prostate in the rat at various times after surgically induced SCI. SCI resulted in an acute decrease in prostate weight and an increase in steady state level of mRNA for testosterone-repressed prostate message 2 (TRPM 2) during the first 2 weeks postinjury. These changes perhaps relate to an increase in cell death or a decrease in secretory activity due to an acute suppression of serum testosterone after the injury. Concomitantly, there was a transient, but significant, decrease in the steady state level of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA in the prostate during the first 2 weeks after SCI, an indication of an altered autoregulation of AR by its own ligand. Despite the fact that growth of the prostate, as indicated by weight increase, in SCI rats resumed 2 weeks postinjury, prostate weights were persistently lower in SCI rats than sham-operated controls for at least 3 months. Furthermore, prostate TRPM 2 mRNA levels remained elevated throughout the recovery period even after a normal prostate weight had been restored. In addition, a decrease in the height of ventral prostate epithelial cells was noted in SCI rats 28 and 90 days postinjury. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of SCI on prostate function. These findings and our unreported observation of persistently smaller seminal vesicles in the same groups of SCI rats suggest that functions of male accessory sex glands may also be compromised after SCI. These changes may affect biochemical properties of the secretory products of these glands and may provide some explanation for the reported changes in the composition of the seminal plasma and abnormal sperm motility seen in the semen of SCI men.","testosterone","pubmed"

Here we examined whether a combinatory strategy would support regeneration of descending axons across a cervical (C5) lateral hemisection lesion in the rat spinal cord. Following spinal cord transections, Schwann cell (SC)-seeded alginate hydrogels were grafted to the lesion site and AAV5 expressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter was injected caudally. In addition, we examined whether SC injection into the caudal spinal parenchyma would further enhance regeneration of descending axons to re-enter the host spinal cord. Our data show that both serotonergic and descending axons traced by biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) extend throughout the scaffolds. The number of regenerating axons is significantly increased when caudal BDNF expression is activated and transient BDNF delivery is able to sustain axons after gene expression is switched off. Descending axons are confined to the caudal graft/host interface even with continuous BDNF expression for 8weeks. Only with a caudal injection of SCs, a pathway facilitating axonal regeneration through the host/graft interface is generated allowing axons to successfully re-enter the caudal spinal cord. Recovery from spinal cord injury is poor due to the limited regeneration observed in the adult mammalian central nervous system. Biomaterials, cell transplantation and growth factors that can guide axons across a lesion site, provide a cellular substrate, stimulate axon growth and have shown some promise in increasing the growth distance of regenerating axons. In the present study, we combined an alginate biomaterial with linear channels with transplantation of Schwann cells within and beyond the lesion site and injection of a regulatable vector for the transient expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Our data show that only with the full combination axons extend across the lesion site and that expression of BDNF beyond 4weeks does not further increase the number of regenerating axons.","tetracycline","pubmed"

It has been shown to target multiple secondary injury mechanisms in spinal cord injury, via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The secondary injury mechanisms that MH can potentially target include inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, ischemia, hemorrhage, and edema. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of the multifaceted actions of MH. Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are partially achieved through conserved mechanisms such as modulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways as well as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Additionally, MH can directly inhibit calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mitochondrial calcium uptake, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzymatic activity, and iron toxicity. It can also directly scavenge free radicals. Because it can target many secondary injury mechanisms, MH treatment holds great promise for reducing tissue damage and promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury.","tetracycline","pubmed"

Microglial and astrocyte activation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at two sites: at the level of hemisection and at the 5th lumbar level (L5). In rats, spinal cord hemisection reduced locomotor function and induced a mechanical hyperalgesia of the ipsilateral hind limb. The expression of Iba1 and GFAP was also increased in the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord at the site of hemisection and at the L5 level. Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline facilitated overall motor recovery and attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia. The expression of Iba1 and GFAP in the spinal cord was also reduced in rats treated with minocycline. By inhibiting microglia and astrocyte activation, minocycline may facilitate motor recovery and attenuate mechanical hyperalgesia in individuals with spinal cord injuries.","tetracycline","pubmed"

Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, modified Montoya staircase test and grooming test. Forepaw sensitivity was also assessed using the electronic von Frey Aesthesiometer. The corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts were traced and the spinal cords were harvested 7 weeks after injury. The extent of gray matter and white matter sparing and corticospinal and rubrospinal tract sprouting were evaluated in cross sections of the spinal cord. In the end, neither minocycline nor simvastatin treatment was associated with improved performance on the behavioral tests, as compared to saline controls. Performance on the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, and von Frey sensory test were similar among all groups.

Based on previous reports, minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, exerts neuroprotection partially by inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c release and reactive microgliosis. We first evaluated cytochrome c release at the injury epicenter after a T10 contusive SCI in rats. Cytochrome c release peaked at approximately 4-8 h postinjury. A dose-response study generated a safe pharmacological regimen that enabled i.p. minocycline to significantly lower cytosolic cytochrome c at the epicenter 4 h after SCI. In the long-term study, i.p. minocycline (90 mg/kg administered 1 h after SCI followed by 45 mg/kg administered every 12 h for 5 days) markedly enhanced long-term hind limb locomotion relative to that of controls. Coordinated motor function and hind limb reflex recoveries also were improved significantly. Histopathology suggested that minocycline treatment alleviated later-phase tissue loss, with significant sparing of white matter and ventral horn motoneurons at levels adjacent to the epicenter. Furthermore, glial fibrillary acidic protein and 2',3' cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase immunocytochemistry showed an evident reduction in astrogliosis and enhanced survival of oligodendrocytes. Therefore, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c is an important secondary injury mechanism in SCI. Drugs with multifaceted effects in antagonizing this process and microgliosis may protect a proportion of spinal cord tissue that is clinically significant for functional recovery. Minocycline, with its proven clinical safety, capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrated efficacy during a clinically relevant therapeutic window, may become an effective therapy for acute SCI.","tetracycline","pubmed"

But another aspect of mitochondrial function is the generation of more than 90% of cellular energy in the form of ATP, mediated by the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) process. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a central OxPhos component and changes in its activity reflect changes in energy demand. A recent study suggests that respiratory muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is compromised via alterations in mitochondrial function. In an animal model of cervical spinal cord hemisection (C2HS) respiratory dysfunction, we have shown that theophylline improves respiratory function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that theophylline improves respiratory function at the cellular level via improved mitochondrial function in the C2HS model. We demonstrate that CcO activity was significantly (33%) increased in the spinal cord adjacent to the site of injury (C3-C5), and that administration of theophylline (20mg/kg 3x daily orally) after C2HS leads to an even more pronounced increase in CcO activity of 62% compared to sham-operated animals. These results are paralleled by a significant increase in cellular ATP levels (51% in the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection). We conclude that C2HS increases energy demand and activates mitochondrial respiration, and that theophylline treatment improves energy levels through activation of the mitochondrial OxPhos process to provide energy for tissue repair and functional recovery after paralysis in the C2HS model.","theophylline","pubmed"

Cervical SCI often results in a compromised respiratory system. Primary treatment of SCI patients with respiratory insufficiency continues to be with mechanical ventilatory support. In an animal model of SCI, an upper cervical spinal cord hemisection paralyzes the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the side of injury. However, a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore respiratory function after injury. In this review, restoration of respiratory activity following systemic administration of theophylline, a respiratory stimulant will be discussed. Pharmacologically, theophylline is a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a bronchodilator. It has been used in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in treatment of apnea in premature infants. However, the clinical use of theophylline to improve respiration in SCI patients with respiratory deficits is a more recent approach. This review will focus on the use of theophylline to restore respiratory activity in an animal model of SCI. In this model, a C2 hemisection (C2HS) interrupts the major descending respiratory pathways and paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. The review also highlights involvement of central and peripheral adenosine receptors in functional restitution. Biochemical binding assays that highlight changes in adenosine receptors after chronic theophylline administration are discussed as they pertain to understanding adenosine receptor-mediation in functional recovery.

Previous studies have shown that chronic oral administration of theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an adenosine receptor antagonist, can restore function to the quiescent phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to hemisection. Both of these actions of theophylline result in an increase in 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, the chronic theophylline-mediated respiratory recovery persists long after the animals have been weaned from the drug. To date, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the recovery induced by theophylline are still not known. Since theophylline has two modes of action, in the present study we tested whether chronic administration of pentoxifylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 specific inhibitor, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, would induce recovery similar to that induced by theophylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats following a left C2 spinal cord lesion. Recovery of left phrenic nerve activity was assessed at 5 or 10 days after the last drug administrations to assess the persistent nature of the recovery. Pentoxifylline, rolipram and DPCPX, all capable of modulating 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, brought about long-term respiratory recovery in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the left C2 lesion at 5 and 10 days after the last drug administration.

The purpose of this review is to describe mechanisms that underlie theophylline-induced recovery of respiratory-related function following C2 hemisection and to underscore the therapeutic potential of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline mediates recovery of respiratory-related activity via antagonism of central adenosine A(1) receptors. When administered chronically, the drug restores and maintains recovered function. Since theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist with affinity for both the adenosine A(1) and A(2) receptors, we assessed the relative contributions of each receptor to functional recovery. While A(1) receptor antagonism plays a predominant role, activation of the A(2) receptors by specific agonists subserves the A(1) receptor-mediated actions. That is, when an adenosine A(2) receptor agonist is administered first, it primes the system such that subsequent administration of the A(1) antagonist induces a greater degree of recovered respiratory activity than when the antagonist alone is administered. Chronic oral administration of theophylline in C2 hemisected animals demonstrates that even when animals have been weaned from the drug, theophylline-induced recovered respiratory actions persist. This suggests that in clinical application, it may not be necessary to maintain patients on long-term theophylline. We have shown that recovery of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve can occur spontaneously 3-4 months after C2 hemisection. Theophylline administration after this post-injury period obliterates/negates the recovery function. This indicates strongly that there is therapeutic window (more acutely after injury) for the initiation of theophylline therapy. We have also demonstrated that peripheral (carotid bodies) adenosine A(1) receptors can be selectively activated to modulate theophylline-induced CNS actions. Blocking central adenosine receptors while simultaneously activating peripheral adenosine receptors minimizes the potential of respiratory muscle fatigue with theophylline. The significance of the current findings lies in the potential clinical application of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. The ultimate goal of theophylline therapy is to wean ventilator-dependent patients off ventilatory support. Thus far, our animal studies suggest that the onset of theophylline therapy must be soon after injury.","theophylline","pubmed"

In this model, an upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemi paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Theophylline restores respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed hemidiaphragm via activation of a latent respiratory motor pathway. Antagonism of central adenosine A1 receptors mediates this action. Theophylline also enhances respiratory frequency, f, defined as breaths per minute. Thus, long-term use may result in respiratory muscle or motoneuron fatigue particularly after spinal cord injury. We assessed the effects of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, N6-p-sulfophenyladenosine (p-SPA) on theophylline's action in our model under standardized recording conditions. Four groups of rats, classified as hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies denervated (H-CBD or NH-CBD), and hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies intact (H-CBI or NH-CBI ) were used in the study. Eight days after recovery from carotid denervation, a left C2 hemi was performed in H-CBD rats. C2 hemi was also performed in H-CBI animals, and 24 h later, electrophysiologic experiments on respiratory activity were conducted in both groups of animals. Two groups using nonhemisected controls were also employed as described above. In H-CBD rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced respiratory-related activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In NH-CBD rats, theophylline significantly enhanced f. In both H-CBD and NH-CBD rats, p-SPA (0.25 mg/kg) did not significantly change theophylline-induced effects. In H-CBI rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In H-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced the values to pre-theophylline discharge levels. Recovered activity was not obliterated with the agonist. In NH-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced theophylline-induced effects to pre-drug discharge levels. Adenosine A1 and A2A receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the carotid bodies. The significance of our findings is that theophylline-induced effects can be normalized to pre-drug levels by the selective activation of peripheral adenosine A1 receptors.

To assess putative effects of systemic theophylline administration on further enhancing spontaneous respiratory muscle recovery 4 months after C2 hemisection in rats and to determine whether adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression is altered in these animals. Electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity in the phrenic nerves was conducted in C2 hemisected rats 4 months after hemisection under standardized conditions. Immediately thereafter, rats were killed and the cervical spinal cords were prepared for adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. Spontaneous recovery of respiratory activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve was detected in a majority (15/20) of C2 hemisected animals and amounted to 44.06% +/- 2.38% when expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral phrenic nerve in noninjured animals. At the optimal dosage used in the acute studies, theophylline (15 mg/kg) did not enhance, but rather unexpectedly blocked, recovered respiratory activity in 4 out of 5 animals tested. At dosages of 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, the drug blocked recovered respiratory activity in 3 out of 4 and 3 out of 5 animals tested, respectively. Quantitative analysis of adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression did not reveal a significant difference between experimental animals and sham-operated animals. The blockade or attenuation of spontaneously recovered respiratory activity following theophylline administration cannot be attributed to changes in adenosine A1 receptors because there were no significant differences in adenosine A1 mRNA expression with sham-operated animals. Lack of alteration in A1 mRNA expression 4 months after cervical SCI suggests that A1 receptor plasticity is not activated by chronic injury. Obliteration of spontaneous recovery with theophylline most likely involves a separate unknown mechanism. These findings suggest that there may be a limited therapeutic window for the clinical application of theophylline in SCI patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline may be more effective clinically in the acute phase of injury rather than in the chronic phase.","theophylline","pubmed"

Previous studies from our laboratory have established that a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore function to a hemidiaphragm paralysed by upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection during a reflex known as the 'crossed phrenic phenomenon'. In addition, theophylline, a general adenosine A1 and A2 receptor antagonist, can activate the latent pathway by acting centrally through antagonism at adenosine receptors. 2. The present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in inducing functional recovery in our model of spinal cord injury. Specific adenosine A1 and A2 agonists and antagonists were used in an electrophysiological study. 3. Our results demonstrate that, in hemisected rats, systemic administration of the adenosine A1 receptor-specific antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) restores, in a dose-dependent manner, phrenic nerve respiratory related output that is lost following hemisection. Furthermore, DPCPX augments respiratory activity in non-injured animals. The A2 receptor agonist CGS-21680 mediates its effects by predominantly acting on peripheral rather than central nervous system (CNS) receptors. CGS-21680 modulates respiratory related phrenic nerve activity in non-injured animals by enhancing tonic activity, but does not induce recovery of phrenic nerve activity in hemisected animals in the majority of cases. When CGS-21680 was administered prior to DPCPX in hemisected rats, the magnitude of recovery of respiratory function was significantly greater than that elicited by DPCPX alone. However, when the A2 receptor agonist was administered after DPCPX, the magnitude of recovery was virtually unchanged, whereas activity in the right phrenic nerve was significantly enhanced. The A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine depressed respiratory activity in non-injured, as well as hemisected, rats. The A2 receptor antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine did not affect respiratory activity. 4. We conclude that while antagonism at central adenosine A1 receptors mediates functional restitution in hemisected animals, activation of A2 receptors located outside of the CNS subserves the A1 receptor-mediated respiratory recovery.","theophylline","pubmed"

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A1 adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase; or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine A1 receptors. Theophylline induced, and maintained, hemidiaphragmatic recovery for prolonged periods after C2 spinal cord hemisection in rats and may prove to be beneficial in assisting respiration in spinal cord injury patients.","theophylline","pubmed"

The present study seeks to extend the previous investigations by contrasting and quantitating the actions of theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline, enprofylline, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline in restoring function 24 h after hemidiaphragm paralysis. The alkylxanthines were selected based on their diverse pharmacologic profiles to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie functional recovery after spinal cord injury. To quantitatively assess the magnitude of recovery, electrophysiological experiments were conducted on pancuronium-paralyzed, hemisected animals under standardized recording conditions. The total absence of respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and paralyzed hemidiaphragm was used as the index of a functionally complete hemisection. Thereafter, drug-induced recovered activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection was quantified and expressed either as a percentage of contralateral phrenic nerve activity in the same animal prior to drug administration or as a percentage of predrug activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals. With either approach, theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced respiratory-related recovered activity. Enprofylline, a potent bronchodilator, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist with limited access to the central nervous system, were ineffective. Maximal recovery was attained with theophylline (15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 mg/kg). At these doses, theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline induced recovery that was 70.0 +/- 2.5 and 69.3 +/- 4.1% of predrug contralateral nerve activity respectively. When expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude changed to 32.9 +/- 4.9 and 35.7 +/- 6.9%, respectively. Involvement of adenosine receptors in the alkylxanthine-induced actions was confirmed in experiments with the adenosine analog, N6 (l-2-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA). It is concluded that central adenosine receptor-mediated mechanisms are implicated in the recovery of respiratory-related activity after spinal cord injury.

There were three separate groups of spinal hemisected rats and one nonhemisected group studied. Twenty-four hours following C2 spinal hemisection, ipsilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded under standardized, normoxic and then hypoxic conditions. After 30 min, theophylline was administered and the recordings were repeated in group 1 animals. In group 2, activity in both phrenic nerves was recorded simultaneously before and after drug administration. In a third group of rats, both ipsilateral phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragmatic activities were monitored before and after the drug. In control nonhemisected animals under standardized recording conditions, the effects of theophylline were quantitatively assessed by determining the mean area under integrated phrenic nerve discharge waveforms before and after drug administration. Generally, theophylline induced biphasic effects; i.e., at a low dose (15 mg/kg) it evoked excitation, while at a high dose (30 mg/kg) depression of respiratory activity predominated. In group 2 animals, respiratory activity was induced in the nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve for up to 3 h after a single standard dose of theophylline (15 mg/kg). Prior to drug administration, there was an absence of respiratory-related activity in both the phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to C2 spinal cord hemisection. A standard dose of theophylline, however, induced recovery of activity in both the phrenic nerve and the left hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection in group 3 animals. In control (nonhemisected) animals, theophylline enhanced phrenic nerve activity, but decreased the duration of respiratory bursts. These results show for the first time that theophylline can activate latent respiratory motor pathways and thus restore the respiratory drive to phrenic motoneurons lost by spinal cord injury. Respiratory activity is not only reestablished in the phrenic nerve made quiescent by hemisection, but it is also enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve. The drug also restores function to the hemidiaphragm paralyzed by the spinal cord hemisection. The findings may have clinical relevance to human cases of cervical spinal cord injury in which respiratory function is compromised.","theophylline","pubmed"

After TSCI, pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase (NDC) enzyme was used to maintain energy levels, antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and catalase (ANT) were used to decrease oxidative damage and methylprednisolone (MP), which has both therapeutic properties, was used as a control.

In this study, the effects of administering TCH injections on neurological recovery in post-SCI rats were first tested with regard to the behavior and histology; subsequently, the specific expression profile of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) in their spinal cords were conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The LncRNA-mRNA networks were also elucidated. After SCI, we found that TCH injection with the right dose is effective for the recovery of locomotion function and repairing of the damaged tissue in the spinal cord; TCH injection is also discovered to have a role in the regulation of 443 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 27 differentially expressed LncRNAs (DELs) that are identified to have multiple functions, including locomotion, blood vessel morphogenesis, thiamine metabolism, Hippo signaling pathway, and axon guidance, by applying the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis.

We recently discovered that global knock-out of the thrombin receptor, also known as Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1), accelerates myelin development. Here we demonstrate that knocking out PAR1 also promotes myelin regeneration. Outcomes in two unique models of myelin injury and repair, that is lysolecithin or cuprizone-mediated demyelination, showed that PAR1 knock-out in male mice improves replenishment of myelinating cells and remyelinated nerve fibers and slows early axon damage. Improvements in myelin regeneration in PAR1 knock-out mice occurred in tandem with a skewing of reactive astrocyte signatures toward a prorepair phenotype. In cell culture, the promyelinating effects of PAR1 loss of function are consistent with possible direct effects on the myelinating potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in addition to OPC-indirect effects involving enhanced astrocyte expression of promyelinating factors, such as BDNF. These findings highlight previously unrecognized roles of PAR1 in myelin regeneration, including integrated actions across the oligodendrocyte and astroglial compartments that are at least partially mechanistically linked to the powerful BDNF-TrkB neurotrophic signaling system. Altogether, findings suggest PAR1 may be a therapeutically tractable target for demyelinating disorders of the CNS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Replacement of oligodendroglia and myelin regeneration holds tremendous potential to improve function across neurological conditions. Here we demonstrate Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1) is an important regulator of the capacity for myelin regeneration across two experimental murine models of myelin injury. PAR1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor densely expressed in the CNS, however there is limited information regarding its physiological roles in health and disease. Using a combination of PAR1 knock-out mice, oligodendrocyte monocultures and oligodendrocyte-astrocyte cocultures, we demonstrate blocking PAR1 improves myelin production by a mechanism related to effects across glial compartments and linked in part to regulatory actions toward growth factors such as BDNF. These findings set the stage for development of new clinically relevant myelin regeneration strategies.","thrombin","pubmed"

In addition, apoptosis was also significantly decreased, as shown by TUNEL staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI and by Western blotting for caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expression. Due to the mechanism of action of NM as a serine protease inhibitor, the drug decreased thrombin expression in the damaged spinal cord.

Although the working mechanism of PAR-1 is becoming clear, the functional role of PAR-1 and its correlation with APC in the injured spinal cord remains to be elucidated. Here we investigated if PAR-1 and APC are determinants of long-term functional recovery after a spinal cord contusive injury using PAR-1 null and wild-type mice. We found that neutrophil infiltration and disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier were significantly reduced in spinal cord injured PAR-1 null mice relative to the wild-type group. Both locomotor recovery and ability to descend an inclined grid were significantly improved in the PAR-1 null group 42 days after injury and this improvement was associated with greater long-term sparing of white matter and a reduction in glial scarring. Wild-type mice treated with APC acutely after injury showed a similar level of improved locomotor recovery to that of PAR-1 null mice. However, improvement of APC-treated PAR-1 null mice was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated PAR-1 null mice, suggesting that APC acts through PAR-1.

Moreover, in axon collapse assays, PRG3-induced neurites resisted growth inhibitors such as myelin, Nogo-A (Reticulon/RTN-4), thrombin and LPA and impeded the RhoA-Rock-PIP5K induced neurite repulsion. Transgenic adult mice with constitutive PRG3 expression displayed strong axonal sprouting distal to a spinal cord lesion. Moreover, fostered PRG3 expression promoted complex motor-behavioral recovery compared to wild type controls as revealed in the Schnell swim test (SST). Thus, PRG3 emerges as a developmental RasGRF1-dependent conductor of filopodia formation and axonal growth enhancer. PRG3-induced neurites resist brain injury-associated outgrowth inhibitors and contribute to functional recovery after spinal cord lesions. Here, we provide evidence that PRG3 operates as an essential neuronal growth promoter in the nervous system. Maintaining PRG3 expression in aging brain may turn back the developmental clock for neuronal regeneration and plasticity.","thrombin","pubmed"

In this study we demonstrate that the thrombin receptor (Protease Activated Receptor 1, (PAR1)) serves as a critical translator of the spinal cord injury (SCI) proteolytic microenvironment into a cascade of pro-inflammatory events that contribute to astrogliosis and functional decline. PAR1 knockout mice displayed improved locomotor recovery after SCI and reduced signatures of inflammation and astrogliosis, including expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, and STAT3 signaling. SCI-associated elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 were also reduced in PAR1-/- mice and co-ordinate improvements in tissue sparing and preservation of NeuN-positive ventral horn neurons, and PKCγ corticospinal axons, were observed. PAR1 and its agonist's thrombin and neurosin were expressed by perilesional astrocytes and each agonist increased the production of IL-6 and STAT3 signaling in primary astrocyte cultures in a PAR1-dependent manner. In turn, IL-6-stimulated astrocytes increased expression of PAR1, thrombin, and neurosin, pointing to a model in which PAR1 activation contributes to increased astrogliosis by feedforward- and feedback-signaling dynamics. Collectively, these findings identify the thrombin receptor as a key mediator of inflammation and astrogliosis in the aftermath of SCI that can be targeted to reduce neurodegeneration and improve neurobehavioral recovery.","thrombin","pubmed"

In some cases, the partition contained non-neuronal scar tissue. There was extensive outgrowth of GFP labeled axons from the graft, but there was minimal ingrowth of host axons into the graft revealed by tract tracing and immunocytochemistry for 5HT.

In this regard, intravenous activated protein C (aPC) improved neurologic outcomes in a rat compression spinal cord injury (SCI) model. Protein C activation occurs when the serine protease thrombin binds to the cell surface proteoglycan thrombomodulin (TM) forming a complex that halts coagulation. In culture, rTM blocks thrombin's activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), that mediate thrombin killing of neurons and glial reactivity. Both PAR1 and prothrombin are rapidly upregulated after contusion SCI in rats, prior to peak apoptosis. We now report neuroprotective effects of intraperitoneal soluble recombinant human rTM on open-field locomotor rating scale (BBB) and spinal cord lesion volume when given 1 h after SCI. BBB scores from four separate experiments showed a 7.6 +/- 1.4 absolute score increase (p < 0.05) at 3 days, that lasted throughout the time course. Histological sections at 14 days were even more dramatic where a twofold reduction in lesion volume was quantified in rTM-treated rats. Thionin staining revealed significant preservation of motor neuronal profiles both at, and two segments below, the lesion epicenter. Activated caspase-3 immunocytochemistry indicated apoptosis was quite prominent in motor neurons in vehicle (saline) controls, but was dramatically reduced by rTM. Microglia, increased and activated after injury, were reduced with rTM treatment. Taken together, these and previous results support a prominent role for coagulation-inflammation signaling cascades in the subacute changes following SCI. They identify a neuroprotective role for rTM by its inhibition of thrombin generation and blockade of PAR activation.","thrombin","pubmed"

Lower limb paralysis is a known major risk factor for venous thrombosis, supposedly due to the venostasis in relation with total immobility. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the endothelial response to anoxia to determine whether recovery of fibrinolytic potential occurs in patients subjected to forced bedrest because of a spinal cord injury and whether this recovery is related to the incidence and/or evolution of DVT. We evaluated vascular endothelium reactivity in the lower limbs no longer submitted to the hydrostatic pressure of the erected position in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia and in 10 normal volunteers after venous occlusion produced by the application of 10 cm Hg pressure to the lower limb for 15 min comparatively to the upper limb used as reference. Among the 15 patients, 10 whose spinal cord injury had occurred 1 to 6 months earlier were still receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, whereas the five other patients were not receiving prophylactic anticoagulants because the injury dated back 6 months or more. After venostasis, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) increased significantly in both patients and controls in the upper limb (tPA levels twofold and threefold respectively in controls and patients) but showed no significant changes in the lower limb; prolonged immobility did not allow recovery in the lower limbs of a level of fibrinolytic responsiveness identical to that in the upper limbs. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI1) remained unchanged after anoxia, although wide interindividual variations were seen. Natural coagulation inhibitors and circulating blood stigmates of hypercoagulability were measured. None of the patients had abnormally low levels of coagulation inhibitors (ie, antithrombin III, protein C and protein S levels were normal). Seventy-five per cent of patients (prophylactically anticoagulated or not) had very high levels of fibrin degradation products (D. Dimer levels sevenfold to eightfold those of the controls), but all patients had normal levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragments 1 + 2. The permanence of the thrombotic process characterized by an increase in D. Dimer levels without recovery of fibrinolytic potential suggests a proposal for the patients an indefinite antithrombotic treatment at curative doses.","thrombin","pubmed"

We placed subjects on a 4-week program and measured the change in clinical measures of walking speed, endurance, and mobility. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to class subjects into groups based on recovery patterns. Two classes of recovery were found by GMM: high and low functioning. Radom coefficient regression (RCR) was then used to identify significant changes over time. Statistically significant improvements in walking endurance were shown for the high functioning group. However, a small number of subjects in the high functioning group showed improvement greater than the smallest real difference (SRD), which indicates a clinical significance as well. We also investigated the extent to which these recovery patterns can be predicted using baseline measures. Baseline walking endurance was found to be a robust predictor of recovery in walking endurance. Subjects that began the intervention with already higher endurance showed a greater chance of improvement in endurance over time. This information could potentially be used as a fast and reliable assessment tool for clinicians to predict which patient can benefit the most from this intervention prior to prescribing the medication, and thus optimizing cost and resources.

The outcome measures were walking speed, endurance and mobility. Subjects were randomized into one of three groups; no intervention (control), Lokomat (Lok) and tizanidine (Tiz).

However, changes with training were clinically important only for approximately 10% of subjects, who achieved a minimal important difference (MID) in functional outcomes as a result of the training. We used mixed model ANOVAs to compare the group effects. Improvements with training were seen in both classes, however no differences between interventions were found. The GMM had classed all subjects that achieved the MID as high functioning.

Participants with an incomplete SCI were assigned to 3 groups: no intervention, Lokomat, or tizanidine. Outcome measures were the 10-m walk test, 6-minute walk test, and the Timed Up and Go.

Overall, walking speed and endurance improved, with no difference between interventions. Only a small number of participants achieved the MID.

GMM-RCR classification also showed that speed and mobility improved after locomotor training. Improvements in function were achieved in a limited number of people with SCI.

Since these measures are neither objective nor quantitative, the therapeutic effects of such medications on neuromuscular properties have not been fully evaluated. In this study, as a first attempt, we examined the effect of tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication, on modification of the neuromuscular properties of patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Each patient was administered 2 mg of tizanidine four times per day for four weeks. The spastic ankle of each patient was evaluated at baseline (prior to any medication, and then 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the start of medication. The ankle was perturbed with a small-amplitude Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) perturbation at various positions over the ankle range-of-motion. A parallel-cascade system identification technique, which provides an objective and quantitative measure of neuromuscular properties, was used to calculate the intrinsic and reflex stiffness. The stiffness vs. joint angle trends were then calculated for each evaluation; these curves were compared across the intervention time to determine the recovery pattern (i.e. change over time) due to the tizanidine intervention. All patients exhibited decreases in reflex stiffness (which abnormally increase after SCI) due to the medication; however, patients were observed to exhibit multiple recovery patterns. For some patients, the reflex stiffness continuously reduced over the four-week intervention period, while for other patients, the decrease during the first week (i.e. between the baseline and 1-Week evaluations) was most pronounced. Also, some patients presented a significant decrease with time, while others presented no improvement in the intrinsic stiffness. These findings suggest that tizanidine may be effective in reducing not only reflex stiffness, but also the subject's intrinsic stiffness for certain patients. Future work remains to identify predictors which can objectively determine which patients are likely to exhibit maximal benefit from the tizanidine prior to being prescribed with the medication.","tizanidine","pubmed"

Because of persistent severe urge incontinence, 1 woman required conversion of her ileovesicostomy to an ileal conduit with concurrent cystectomy. The ileovesicostomy of another myelodysplastic man who had four failed artificial urinary sphincters in the past was also converted to an ileal conduit because of persistent urethroperineal fistula despite perineal urethral closure. Renal function was preserved in all patients. Long-term complications were stomal stenosis in 2 patients, bladder and kidney stone formation in 5, and symptomatic urinary tract infections in 3.

Severe preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary.

After rat models of thoracic contusive SCI were established by free weight-drop method, TPM (40 mg/kg) was given at 12-hour intervals for four times orally. Post TPM treatment, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were significantly reduced and reduced glutathione levels were increased, while immunoreactivity for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 was diminished in SCI rats. In addition, TPM treatment improved the functional recovery of SCI rats. This study suggests that administration of TPM exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI.","topiramate","pubmed"

Human trials must be performed to determine whether individuals with SCI respond similarly. We hypothesized that Buspirone and Trazodone would decrease the propensity to hypocapnic CSA during sleep. We studied eight males with chronic SCI and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [age: 48.8 ± 14.2 yr; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 44.9 ± 23.1] in a single-blind crossover design. For 13 days, participants were randomly assigned either Buspirone (7.5-15 mg twice daily), Trazodone (100 mg), or a placebo followed by a 14-day washout period before crossing over to the other interventions. Study nights included polysomnography and induction of CSA using a noninvasive ventilation protocol. We assessed indexes of SDB, CO2 reserve, apneic threshold (AT), controller gain (CG), plant gain (PG), and ventilatory parameters. CO2 reserve was significantly widened on Buspirone (-3.6 ± 0.9 mmHg) compared with both Trazodone (-2.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.009) and placebo (-1.8 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.001) but not on Trazodone vs. placebo (P = 0.061).

Here we show that AQP4 cell-surface abundance increases in response to hypoxia-induced cell swelling in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Calmodulin directly binds the AQP4 carboxyl terminus, causing a specific conformational change and driving AQP4 cell-surface localization. Inhibition of calmodulin in a rat spinal cord injury model with the licensed drug trifluoperazine inhibited AQP4 localization to the blood-spinal cord barrier, ablated CNS edema, and led to accelerated functional recovery compared with untreated animals.

Particular interest has focused on the inhibitory role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and their formation into dense lattice-like structures, termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), which enwrap sub-populations of neurons and restrict plasticity. Recent studies in mammalian systems have implicated CSPGs and PNNs in regulating and restricting structural plasticity. The enzymatic degradation of CSPGs or destabilization of PNNs has been shown to enhance neuronal activity and plasticity after central nervous system injury. This review focuses on the role of the ECM, CSPGs and PNNs; and how developmental and pharmacological manipulation of these structures have enhanced neuronal plasticity and aided functional recovery in regeneration, stroke, and amblyopia. In addition to CSPGs, this review also points to the functions and potential therapeutic value of these and several other key ECM molecules in epileptogenesis and dementia.","urokinase","pubmed"

This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury.

Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort).

VPA has a potential to provide a new therapeutic strategy for sensorineural olfactory dysfunction. To elucidate the effects of VPA on regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons, we examined the in vivo effects of oral VPA administration on recovery from methimazole-induced degeneration of olfactory neuroepithelium in mice. Male ICR mice (10 weeks old) were intraperitoneally injected with methimazole (75 mg/kg), an olfactory toxic reagent, to induce degenerative changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium. The effects of daily VPA administration on recovery from methimazole-induced changes were examined histologically. Oral VPA administration dose dependently enhanced increases in epithelial thickness and number of olfactory marker protein (OMP) positive cells in the olfactory epithelium during recovery from methimazole-induced degeneration. VPA also enhanced early increases in the number of Ki-67(+) and growth-associated protein-43(+) cells during the regeneration of olfactory neuroepithelium. VPA administration promotes regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons in damaged neuroepithelium by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of olfactory precursor cells. VPA has been used for several decades to safely treat neurological disorders. VPA may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction caused by degeneration of the olfactory neuroepithelium.","valproic_acid","pubmed"

Here, we examined whether valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, would attenuate BSCB disruption by inhibiting MMP-9 activity, leading to improvement of functional outcome after SCI. After moderate spinal cord contusion injury at T9, VPA (300 mg/kg) were immediately injected subcutaneously and further injected every 12 h for 5 days. Our data show that VPA inhibited MMP-9 activity after injury, and attenuated BSCB permeability and degradation of tight junction molecules such as occludin and ZO-1. In addition, VPA reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, VPA increased the levels of acetylated histone 3, pAkt, and heat-shock protein 27 and 70, which have anti-apoptotic functions after SCI.

Delayed VPA injection (8 h following SCI) significantly accelerated locomotor recovery. VPA therapy also suppressed SCI-induced hypoacetylation of histone and promoted expressions of BDNF and GDNF. Next, the influence of VPA on axonal growth inhibited by a myelin protein was tested. Neurons from embryonic spinal cord or hippocampus were cultured on plates coated with Nogo-A peptide, and escalating concentrations of VPA were added into the cultures. VPA treatment, in a concentration dependent manner, allowed neurons to overcome Nogo-A inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Meanwhile, VPA exposure increased the level of histone acetylation and expression of BDNF in spinal neurons. Cumulatively, these findings indicate that VPA is possibly a promising medication and deserves translational trials for spinal cord injury.","valproic_acid","pubmed"

We previously reported that degeneration of oligodendrocytes and neurons that occurs after SCI is associated with the development of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the progressive accumulation of the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP. Since following ER stress, the balance between the pro-survival chaperone BiP and CHOP drives the cell destiny, we aimed to find drugs that modulate this ratio in favour of the former. We found that valproate (VPA) induced a significant reduction of CHOP levels after ER stress in an organotypic-based culture of spinal cord in vitro. We then administered different doses of VPA to rats following spinal cord contusion, and found that the treatment caused a marked reduction of CHOP levels early after the lesion. In addition, VPA administration partially prevented cord tissue, myelin and axonal loss, and significantly increased the relative number of surviving oligodendrocytes in the damaged spinal cord. Besides, VPA-treated rats showed better recovery of the locomotor activity than vehicle-treated rats after SCI.

VPA treatment promoted the differentiation of transplanted NSCs into neurons rather than glial cells. Transsynaptic anterograde corticospinal tract tracing revealed that transplant-derived neurons reconstructed broken neuronal circuits, and electron microscopic analysis revealed that the transplant-derived neurons both received and sent synaptic connections to endogenous neurons. Ablation of the transplanted cells abolished the recovery of hind limb motor function, confirming that NSC transplantation directly contributed to restored motor function. These findings raise the possibility that epigenetic status in transplanted NSCs can be manipulated to provide effective treatment for SCI.","valproic_acid","pubmed"

We hypothesized that VPA could enhance axonal regeneration in the rat. In the present research, we demonstrate the effect of VPA on peripheral nerve regeneration and recovery of motor function through a silicon tube implanted with VPA. The left sciatic nerves were exposed through dorsal-splitting incisions, and 8-mm nerve sections were excised at the middle of the thigh. Then, a 1.0-cm-long silicone tube (internal diameter,1.0 mm; exterior diameter, 2.0 mm) was used to bridge the nerve deficit, anchored to the proximal and distal terminals of the excised deficit of sciatic nerves with 9-0 nylon epineural suture. Sterile petroleum jelly was used to seal the ends of the tubes to avoid leakage. The rats in the VPA group and control group were locally delivered 10 muL VPA injection (400 mg/5 mL) and normal saline, respectively, after the operation. The sciatic nerve index (SFI) was observed in each animal at 2-week intervals and electrophysiology was studied at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. Histological and morphometrical analyses were performed at the end of the experiment (12 weeks after the operation). Using the digital image-analysis system, the thickness of the myelin sheath was measured, and total numbers of regenerated axons were counted. There was a significant difference in SFI, electrophysiological index (motor-nerve conduct velocity, amplitude of activity potential), and morphometrical results (regenerated axon number and thickness of myelin sheath) in nerve regeneration between the VPA group and controls ( P < 0.05).

The authors hypothesized that recovery in rats after surgery could be reversed by antagonism of spinal oxytocin or vasopressin receptors, that there may be a sex difference, and that spinal oxytocin innervation could change after surgery. Male and female rats underwent partial spinal nerve ligation surgery. Effects of nonselective and selective oxytocin and vasopressin 1A receptor antagonists on mechanical hypersensitivity during partial recovery were assessed (n = 8 to 14/group). Oxytocin immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (n = 7 to 8/group) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for oxytocin-binding receptors in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord (n = 8/group) were measured. Intrathecal injection of oxytocin and vasopressin receptor antagonists were similarly effective at reducing withdrawal threshold (in all experiments from 22 [19, 26] median [first quartile, third quartile]) g to 8.3 [6.4, 12] g after injection) in both sexes, while having no or minimal effects in animals without surgery. Oxytocin fiber immunoreactivity was 3- to 5-fold greater in lumbar than other regions of the spinal cord and was increased more than 2-fold in lumbar cord ipsilateral to surgery. Injury was also associated with a 6.5-fold increase in oxytocin receptor and a 2-fold increase in vasopressin 1A receptor messenger RNA expression in the L4 dorsal root ganglion ipsilateral to surgery. These findings suggest that the capacity for oxytocin signaling in the spinal cord increases after surgery and that spinal oxytocin signaling plays ongoing roles in both sexes in recovery from mechanical hypersensitivity after surgery with known nerve injury.","vasopressin","pubmed"

One urinary complication that has received little attention is SCI-induced polyuria, even though individuals with SCI will significantly restrict their fluid intake to decrease urine production, leading to sequelae of medical complications. Understanding the mechanisms instigating the development of polyuria will allow us to target interventions that may alleviate polyuria symptoms, leading to significant improvements in the quality of life and urinary health of individuals with SCI. In a rat SCI contusion model, an increase in the amount of urine excreted over a 24-h period ( P ≤ 0.001) was found at 2 wk postinjury. The urine excreted was more dilute with decreased urinary creatinine and specific gravity ( P ≤ 0.001). Several factors important in fluid balance regulation, vasopressin (AVP), natriuretic peptides, and corticosterone (CORT), also changed significantly postinjury. AVP levels decreased ( P = 0.042), whereas atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and CORT increased ( P = 0.005 and P = 0.031, respectively) at 2 wk postinjury. There was also a positive correlation between the increase in ANP and urine volume postinjury ( P = 0.033). The changes in AVP, ANP, and CORT are conducive to producing polyuria, and the timing of these changes coincides with the development of SCI-induced polyuria.

Incomplete SCI (OR, 2.64; p=0.019) and surgery <24 h after SCI (OR, 4.25; p=0.025) were independently associated with improved outcome. In summary, vasopressors are associated with increased complications in SCI patients. Further prospective studies are required in order to determine the potential benefits and risks of blood pressure management in patients with SCI.","vasopressin","pubmed"

To examine the relevance of these findings to neurotrauma, we conducted electrophysiological studies with inorganic Ca(2+) channels blockers and L- and N-subtype-specific calcium channel antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury. Confocal immunohistochemistry was used to examine for localization of L- and N-type calcium channels in spinal cord white matter tracts. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber and injured with a modified clip (2g closing force) for 15s. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential at two points with glass microelectrodes. The compound action potential decreased to 71.4+/-2.0% of control (P<0. 05) after spinal cord injury. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) promoted significantly greater recovery of compound action potential amplitude (86.3+/-7.6% of control; P< 0.05) after injury. Partial blockade of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels with cobalt (20 microM) or cadmium (200 microM) conferred improvement in compound action potential amplitude. Application of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers diltiazem (50 microM) or verapamil (90 microM), and the N-type antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM), significantly enhanced the recovery of compound action potential amplitude postinjury. Co-application of the L-type antagonist diltiazem with the N-type blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA showed significantly greater (P<0.05) improvement in compound action potential amplitude than application of either drug alone. Confocal immunohistochemistry with double labelling for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GalC and NF200 demonstrated L- and N-type Ca(2+) channels on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not axons, in spinal cord white matter. In conclusion, the injurious effects of Ca(2+) in traumatic central nervous system white matter injury appear to be partially mediated by voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. The presence of L- and N-type Ca(2+) channels on periaxonal astrocytes and oligodendrocytes suggests a role for these cells in post-traumatic axonal conduction failure.","verapamil","pubmed"

This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 microM were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (< or = 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 microM), disopyramide (10-300 microM) and bupivacaine (10-100 microM) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 microM. Procainamide (100-300 microM) was ineffective.

In this study, we investigated the BSCB protective role of RA both in vivo and in vitro and demonstrated that autophagy are involved in the BSCB protective effect of RA. Our data show that RA attenuated BSCB permeability and also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as P120, β-catenin, Occludin and Claudin5 after injury in vivo as well as in brain microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, RA administration improved functional recovery of the rat model of trauma. We also found that RA could significantly increase the expression of LC3-II and decrease the expression of p62 both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, combining RA with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) partially abolished its protective effect on the BSCB and exacerbated the loss of tight junctions. Together, our studies indicate that RA improved functional recovery in part by the prevention of BSCB disruption via the activation of autophagic flux after SCI.","vitamin_a","pubmed"

This is despite the fact that individuals with SCI may be at increased risk of peripheral nerve injuries due to wheelchair mobility and baseline sensory deficits. Furthermore, diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury poses a unique challenge in this population because symptoms and signs are superimposed on pre-existing central deficits. We present the case of a 48-year-old man with a C6 AIS A SCI from a motor vehicle accident 22 years earlier who had a new onset compressive radial neuropathy. At initial assessment he complained of paresthesia along his lateral right arm accompanied by new onset wrist-drop. Subsequent radial nerve conduction studies revealed severe reductions in amplitude for sensory and motor action potentials. The patient was managed with mobility exercises and vitamin B supplementation and showed full recovery of motor and sensory function to baseline levels on follow-up 4 months after the injury. The electrophysiologic profile of this patient is illustrative of severe nerve compression for an extended time period. Unlike able-bodied individuals who can reposition themselves to alleviate nerve compression, individuals with SCI may be unaware of nerve compression or unable to reposition themselves. This highlights the need for precautionary measures such as maneuvers and devices to provide trunk and limb stability along with the use of medical alert devices that allow individuals to access timely help when unattended.","vitamin_b","pubmed"

Therefore, providing spinal tissue with an alternative energy substrate during ischemia may be neuroprotective after SCI. To assess this, rats received a mild contusive SCI (120 kdyn, Infinite Horizons impactor) at thoracic level 9 (T9), which causes loss of ∼ 80% of the ascending sensory dorsal column axonal projections to the gracile nucleus. Immediately afterwards, the energy substrate acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC; 1 mg/day) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was infused intrathecally (sub-arachnoid) for 6 days via an L5/6 catheter attached to a subcutaneous Alzet pump. ALC treatment improved overground locomotor function (Basso-Beattie-Breshnahan [BBB] score 18 vs. 13) at 6 days, total spared epicenter (71% vs. 57%) and penumbra white matter (90% vs. 85%), ventral penumbra microvessels (108% vs. 79%), and penumbra motor neurons (42% vs. 15%) at 15 days post-SCI, compared with PBS treatment. However, the ascending sensory projections (anterogradely traced with cholera toxin B from the sciatic nerves) and dorsal column white matter and perfused blood vessels were not protected. Furthermore, grid walking, a task we have shown to be dependent on dorsal column function, was not improved. Thus, mitochondrial substrate replacement may only be efficacious in areas of lesser or temporary ischemia, such as the ventral spinal cord and injury penumbra in this study. The current data also support our previous evidence that microvessel loss is central to secondary tissue degeneration.","vitamin_b","pubmed"

ALCAR administration is neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury, but has not been tested for TBI. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with ALCAR during the first 24 h following TBI in immature rats improves neurologic outcome and reduces cortical lesion volume. Postnatal day 21-22 male rats were isoflurane anesthetized and used in a controlled cortical impact model of TBI to the left parietal cortex. At 1, 4, 12 and 23 h after injury, rats received ALCAR (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or drug vehicle (normal saline). On days 3-7 after surgery, behavior was assessed using beam walking and novel object recognition tests. On day 7, rats were transcardially perfused and brains were harvested for histological assessment of cortical lesion volume, using stereology. Injured animals displayed a significant increase in foot slips compared to sham-operated rats (6 ± 1 SEM vs. 2 ± 0.2 on day 3 after trauma; n = 7; p < 0.05). The ALCAR-treated rats were not different from shams and had fewer foot slips compared to vehicle-treated animals (2 ± 0.4; n = 7; p< 0.05). The frequency of investigating a novel object for saline-treated TBI animals was reduced compared to shams (45 ± 5% vs. 65 ± 10%; n = 7; p < 0.05), whereas the frequency of investigation for TBI rats treated with ALCAR was not significantly different from that of shams but significantly higher than that of saline-treated TBI rats (68 ± 7; p < 0.05). The left parietal cortical lesion volume, expressed as a percentage of the volume of tissue in the right hemisphere, was significantly smaller in ALCAR-treated than in vehicle-treated TBI rats (14 ± 5% vs. 28 ± 6%; p < 0.05).

Two groups were intubated, anesthetized and had moderate brain injury induced by rapid axial head rotation without impact. One group of injured (Inj) animals received folic acid (Fol; 80 μg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 15 min following injury, and then daily for 6 days (Inj + Fol; n = 7). The second group of injured animals received an IP injection of saline (Sal) at the same time points (Inj + Sal; n = 8). Two uninjured (Uninj) control groups (Uninj + Fol, n = 8; Uninj + Sal, n = 7) were intubated, anesthetized and received folic acid (80 μg/kg) or saline by IP injection at the same time points as the injured animals following a sham procedure. Animals underwent neurobehavioral and cognitive testing on days 1 and 4 following injury to assess behavior, memory, learning and problem solving. Serum folic acid and homocysteine levels were collected prior to injury and again before euthanasia. The piglets were euthanized 6 days following injury, and their brains were perfusion fixed for histological analysis. Folic acid levels were significantly higher in both Fol groups on day 6. Homocysteine levels were not affected by treatment. On day 1 following injury, the Inj + Fol group showed significantly more exploratory interest, and better motor function, learning and problem solving compared to the Inj + Sal group. Inj + Fol animals had a significantly lower cognitive composite dysfunction score compared to all other groups on day 1. These functional improvements were not seen on day 4 following injury. Axonal injury measured by β-amyloid precursor protein staining 6 days after injury was not affected by treatment.

In order to prove if early metabolic reactivation is a better therapeutic option than antioxidant therapy in the acute phase of TSCI, spinal cord contusions were performed in adult rats using a well-characterized weight drop technique at thoracic 9 level. After TSCI, pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase (NDC) enzyme was used to maintain energy levels, antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and catalase (ANT) were used to decrease oxidative damage and methylprednisolone (MP), which has both therapeutic properties, was used as a control. Rats were divided into one sham group and six with TSCI; one of them received no treatment, and the rest were treated with NDC, MP, NDC + MP, NDC + ANT or ANT. The ANT group decreased lactate and creatine phosphokinase levels and increased the amount of preserved tissue (morphometric analysis) as well as functional recovery (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan or BBB motor scale). In contrast, NDC treatment increased lipid peroxidation, measured through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, as well as spinal cord tissue destruction and functional deficit. Early metabolic reactivation after a TSCI may be deleterious, while natural early metabolic inhibition may not be a ""secondary mechanism of injury"" but a ""secondary neuroprotective response"". While increased antioxidant defence after a TSCI may currently be an ideal therapeutic strategy, the usefulness of metabolic reactivation should be tested in the sub-acute or chronic phases of TSCI and new strategies must continue to be tested for the early ones.","vitamin_b","pubmed"

To evaluate the therapeutic effects of MP, VC and BMMSCs on traumatic SCI, 80 adult male rats were randomly divided into seven groups: control, SCI (SCI induction by weight-drop method), MP (SCI induction, followed by administration of 30 mg/kg MP via the tail vein, once every other 6 hours, for five times), VC (SCI induction, followed by intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg VC once a day, for 28 days), MP + VC (SCI induction, followed by administration of MP and VC as the former), BMMSCs (SCI induction, followed by injection of 3 × 106 BMMSCs at the injury site), and BMMSCs + VC (SCI induction, followed by BMMSCs injection and VC administration as the former). Locomotor recovery was assessed using the Basso Mouse Scale. Injured spinal cord tissue was evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining. Expression of transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 genes was determined using real-time quantitative PCR. BMMSCs intervention better promoted recovery of nerve function of rats with SCI, mitigated nerve cell damage, and decreased expression of transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 genes than MP and/or VC. More importantly, BMMSCs in combination with VC induced more obvious improvements. These results suggest that VC can enhance the neuroprotective effects of BMMSCs against SCI.","vitamin_c","pubmed"

We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI.

In order to confirm the restorative potential of vitamin D, we performed a new study, using a rat model of left cervical hemisection (C2). From Day 1 or Day 7, animals received, during three months, a weekly oral bolus of either cholecalciferol, at the dose of 500 IU/kg/day, or vehicle, namely triglycerides. Rats were assessed every month, using a ladder test for sensori-locomotor ability and neuromuscular capacity. Three months after injury, H-reflex was recorded from left extensor digitorum muscle in order to measure the reflexivity of the sub-lesional region. Ventilatory frequency was also monitored during an electrically induced muscle fatigue of the hindlimb known to enhance muscle metaboreflex and increase respiratory rate. After recording the phrenic nerve activity, ipsilateral to the lesion, during spontaneous breathing, animals were artificially ventilated while paralyzed with a neuromuscular blocking agent and then the brainstem respiratory centres were provoked to maximal output by temporarily stopping the ventilator. Spinal cords were immunostained with an anti-neurofilament antibody to evaluate axon numbers. We show here that vitamin D-treated animals display i) an enhanced locomotor activity, ii) an improved breathing when hindlimb muscle was electrically stimulated to induce fatigue, iii) an H-reflex depression similar to control animals, iv) a phrenic nerve activity response to a temporary asphyxial stress and v) a non significant decreased number of axons in the proximal stump when compared with the Sham group.

This trial stems from previous studies showing that vitamin D supplementation improves functional recovery in rat models of peripheral or central nerve injury. In a first series of experiments, we used a rat model of peripheral nerve trauma to demonstrate the therapeutic efficiency of vitamin D. We first demonstrated that ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) increases the number and the diameter of newly formed axons and improves the response of metabosensitive fibers from tibialis muscle, in a model of transected peroneal nerve. Then, we compared vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 and observed that the latter is more efficient. At the dose of 500 IU/kg/day, vitamin D3 induces a dramatic functional recovery. We also demonstrated that vitamin D3 increases the number of preserved or newly formed axons in the proximal end, the mean axon diameter in the distal end, neurite myelination in both the distal and proximal ends as well as the expression of genes involved in axogenesis and myelination. In parallel, we assessed the therapeutic role of vitamin D on the central nervous system. In a first study, using a rat model of spinal cord compression at the T10 thoracic level, we delivered vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) orally at the dose of 50 IU/kg/day or 200 IU/kg/day. When compared to control animals, vitamin D-treated rats displayed, three months after injury, a significant improvement of ventilatory frequency and a reduction of H reflex indicating functional improvements at three months post-injury. In a second study, we used a rat model of cervical hemisection (C2) with a higher dose of oral vitamin D3 (500 IU/kg/day) delivered weekly, during 12 weeks. We observed an improved locomotor recovery, a reduced spasticity and a significantly higher rate of axons crossing the lesion site in treated animals. However, it must be pointed out that the functional improvement is reduced when vitamin D is provided one week after the trauma.","vitamin_d","pubmed"

However, before bringing this molecule to the clinic, it was of prime importance i) to assess which form - ergocalciferol versus cholecalciferol - and which dose were the most efficient and ii) to identify the molecular pathways activated by this pleiotropic molecule. The rat left peroneal nerve was cut out on a length of 10 mm and autografted in an inverted position. Animals were treated with either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, at the dose of 100 or 500 IU/kg/day, or excipient (Vehicle), and compared to unlesioned rats (Control). Functional recovery of hindlimb was measured weekly, during 12 weeks, using the peroneal functional index. Ventilatory, motor and sensitive responses of the regenerated axons were recorded and histological analysis was performed. In parallel, to identify the genes regulated by vitamin D in dorsal root ganglia and/or Schwann cells, we performed an in vitro transcriptome study. We observed that cholecalciferol is more efficient than ergocalciferol and, when delivered at a high dose (500 IU/kg/day), cholecalciferol induces a significant locomotor and electrophysiological recovery. We also demonstrated that cholecalciferol increases i) the number of preserved or newly formed axons in the proximal end, ii) the mean axon diameter in the distal end, and iii) neurite myelination in both distal and proximal ends.

Female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either with a normal diet or a dietary regiment supplemented with vitamin E (51 IU/g) for eight weeks. The rats were subsequently exposed either to a contusive SCI or sham operation, and evaluated using standard functional behavior analysis. We report that the rats that consumed the vitamin E-enriched diet showed an accelerated bladder recovery and significant improvements in locomotor function relative to controls, as determined by residual volumes and Basso, Beatie, and Bresnaham BBB scores, respectively. Interestingly, the prophylactic dietary intervention did not preserve neurons in the ventral horn of injured rats, but it significantly increased the numbers of oligodendrocytes. Vitamin E supplementation attenuated the depression of the H-reflex (a typical functional consequence of SCI) while increasing the levels of supraspinal serotonin immunoreactivity. Our findings support the potential complementary use of vitamin E to ameliorate sensory and autonomic dysfunctions associated with spinal cord injury, and identified promising new cellular and functional targets of its neuroprotective effects.","vitamin_e","pubmed"

The treatment with the palm vitamin E significantly improved the hind limb locomotor function, reduced the histopathological changes and the morphological damage in the spinal cord. Also, the palm vitamin E indicated a statistically significant decrease in the oxidative damage indicators, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the treated-SCI compared to the untreated-SCI.","vitamin_e","pubmed"

Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experimental procedure. In the sham group, laminectomy at T10 was performed, followed by impactor contusion of the spinal cord. In the control group, only a laminectomy was performed without contusion. Oxidative stress status was assessed by measuring the spinal cord tissue content of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and gluthatione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. We also evaluated the effects of combined VCE treatment using western blot to analyze expression of cleaved caspase-3 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale to evaluate functional outcomes. Combined treatment of VCE significantly counteracted the effects of spinal cord contusion on oxidative stress represented by activities of SOD and GSH-Px (P<0.05). The VCE treatment also significantly enhanced LC3-II expression and decreased cleaved caspase-3 compared with the sham (P<0.05). Furthermore, BBB scores significantly improved in the VCE-treated group compared with the sham group (on day 14 and 28 after SCI; P<0.05). The combined administration of VCE was clearly capable of modulating the antioxidant effects, and of reducing apoptosis and increasing autophagy at the lesion epicenter leading to an improved functional outcome. Use of such clinically ready drugs could help earlier clinical trials in selected cases of human SCIs.","vitamin_e","pubmed"

The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive value of alpha-TOL in IRI of spinal cord. For this study, 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into five experimental groups (n = 10): Control group (C); alpha-TOL control group (CE) which received intramuscular (i.m.) alpha-TOL injections (600 mg/kg); Sham operated group (S), IRI rats were subjected to laparotomy and clamping of the aorta just above the bifurcation for 45 min, then the clamp was released for 48 hrs for reperfusion; and IRIE rats group, received 600 mg/kg of alpha-TOL i.m. twice weekly for 6 weeks, followed by induction of IRI similar to the IRI group. At the end of the experimental protocol; motor, sensory and placing/stepping reflex evaluation was done. Plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx) was measured. Then animals' spinal cord lumbar segments were harvested and homogenized for measurement of the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation products (AOPP), while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity were evaluated. Induction of IRI in rats resulted in significant increases in plasma levels of nitrite/nitrate (p < 0.001) and spinal cord homogenate levels of PGE2, MDA, advanced oxidation protein products AOPP and SOD with significant reduction (p < 0.001) in CAT homogenate levels. Significant impairment of motor, sensory functions and placing/stepping reflex was observed with IRI induction in the spinal cord (p < 0.001). alpha-TOL administration in IRIE group significantly improved all the previously measured parameters compared with IRI group. alpha-TOL administration significantly prevents the damage caused by spinal cord IRI in rats with subsequent recovery of both motor and sensory functions. Alpha-tocopherol improves the oxidative stress level with subsequent reduction of the incidence of neurological deficits due to spinal cord IRI conditions.","vitamin_e","pubmed"

The major site of action appears to be the blood-brain barrier based upon its known localization in cerebrovascular endothelium and numerous studies showing an attenuation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), injury, and ischemia-induced blood-brain barrier permeability. Tirilazad has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in multiple preclinical models of spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and focal cerebral ischemia, as measured by a decrease in cerebral vasospasm, blood-brain barrier compromise, post-traumatic ischemia, edema, ischemic neuronal necrosis and infarction, and improved neurological recovery. This efficacy is correlated with a reduction in markers of oxygen radical-induced LP. Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing in spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and ischemic stroke.

The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), Nissl staining were employed to confirm the protective effect of zinc on neuronal survival and functional recovery in vivo. Western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy-related proteins. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the occurrence of zinc-induced autophagy. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP polarized BV2 cells to a proinflammatory phenotype. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) were chosen to explore the relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. A coimmunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the ubiquitination of the NLRP3 protein. Our data showed that zinc significantly promoted motor function recovery after SCI. In vivo, zinc treatment inhibited the protein expression level of NLRP3 while increasing the level of autophagy. These effects were fully validated by the polarization of BV2 cells to a proinflammatory phenotype. The results showed that when 3-MA and BafA1 were applied, the promotion of autophagy by zinc was blocked and that the inhibitory effect of zinc on NLRP3 was reversed. Furthermore, co-IP confirmed that the promotion of autophagy by zinc also activated the protein expression of ubiquitin and suppressed high levels of NLRP3.

Rat astrocytes were transdifferentiated into neural stem cells in vitro by ZFP521 or Sox2. Then, ZFP521 was applied to the spinal cord injury site of a rat. Transduction, real-time PCR, immunohistofluorescence, and function assessments were performed at 6 weeks post-transduction to evaluate improvement and in vivo lineage reprogramming of astrocytes. Here, we show that Zfp521 is more efficient in reprogramming cultured astrocytes compared with Sox2. In the injured spinal cord of an adult rat, resident astrocytes can be reprogrammed into neurons through a progenitor stage by Zfp521. Importantly, this treatment improves the functional abilities of the rats as evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and further by calculation of its subscores. There was enhanced locomotor activity in the hind limbs, step length, toe spread, foot length, and paw area. In addition, motor evoked potential recordings demonstrated the functional integrity of the spinal cord. These results have indicated that the generation of iNSCs or neurons from endogenous astrocytes by in situ reprogramming might be a potential strategy for SCI repair.","zinc","pubmed"

The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of zinc and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on neuronal recovery after SCI. The SCI model was established by Allen's method. Injured animals were given glucose and zinc gluconate (ZnG; 30 mg/kg) for the first time at 2 h after injury, the same dose was given for 3 days. A cytokine antibody array was used to screen changes in inflammation at the site of SCI lesion. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the distribution of cytokines. Magnetic beads were also used to isolate cells from the site of SCI lesion. We then investigated the effect of Zinc on apoptosis after SCI by Transferase UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining and Western Blotting. Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores and immunofluorescence were employed to investigate neuronal apoptosis and functional recovery. We found that the administration of zinc significantly increased the expression of 19 cytokines in the SCI lesion. Of these, G-CSF was shown to be the most elevated cytokine and was secreted by microglia/macrophages (M/Ms) via the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway after SCI. Increased levels of G-CSF at the SCI lesion reduced the level of neuronal apoptosis after SCI, thus promoting functional recovery. Collectively, our results indicate that the administration of zinc increases the expression of G-CSF secreted by M/Ms, which then leads to reduced levels of neuronal apoptosis after SCI.","zinc","pubmed"

Three groups of patients with comparable injuries were studied; vertebral fractures without neurological impairment (n = 10, group C), patients with TSCI showing no remission (n = 9, group G0), and patients with remission developing positive abbreviated injury score (AIS) conversion within 3 months (n = 10, group G1). Serum samples were available from different time points (upon admission, and after 4, 9 and 12 h, 1 and 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months). Serum trace element concentrations were determined by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, SELENOP by ELISA, and further parameters by laboratory routine. Serum Se and SELENOP concentrations were higher on admission in the remission group (G1) as compared to G0. During the first week, both parameters remained constant in C and G0, whereas they declined significantly in the remission group. Similarly, the concentration changes between admission and 24 h were most pronounced in this group of recovering patients (G1). Binary logistic regression analysis including the delta of Se and SELENOP within the first 24 h indicated an AUC of 90.0% (CI: 67.4%-100.0%) with regards to predicting the outcome after TSCI. A Se deficit might constitute a risk factor for poor outcome after TSCI. A dynamic decline of serum Se and SELENOP concentrations after admission may reflect ongoing repair processes that are associated with higher odds for a positive clinical outcome.","zinc","pubmed"

A total of 126 rats were divided into normal, sham, SCI, negative control (NC), PTC1-RNAi, PTC2-RNAi and PTC1/PTC2-RNAi groups. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale was employed to assess hind limb motor function. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to examine the mRNA and protein levels of PTC1, PTC2, Shh, glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli-1), Smo and Nestin. Tissue morphology was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent staining was conducted to detect neurofilament protein 200 (NF-200) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group displayed higher BBB scores than the SCI and NC groups. Shh, Gli-1, Smo and Nestin expression levels were elevated in the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group. PTC1 and PTC2 mRNA and protein expression was lower in the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group than in the normal, sham and SCI groups.

The secondary processes associated with the primary injury, such as overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation, lead to concomitant compression of the injured spinal cord and neuronal death. Delivery of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an efficient ROS scavenger, to the site of injury can mitigate SCI-induced oxidative stress and tissue damage. Towards this goal catalytically active nanoformulations of SOD1 (""nanozymes"") are developed as a modality for treatment of SCI. Along with the cross-linked polyion complex of SOD1 with polycation poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-polylysine (single-coat (SC) nanozyme), we introduce for the first time the chemically cross-linked multilayer polyion complex in which SOD1 is first incorporated into a polyion complex with polycation, then coated by anionic block copolymer, PEG-polyglutamic acid (double-coat (DC) nanozyme). We developed DC nanozymes with high enzymatic activity and ability to retain and protect SOD1 under physiological conditions. Pharmacokinetic study revealed that DC nanozymes significantly prolonged circulation of active SOD1 in the blood stream compared to free SOD1 or SC nanozymes (half-life was 60 vs 6min). Single intravenous injection of DC nanozymes (5kU of SOD1/kg) improved the recovery of locomotor functions in rats with moderate SCI, along with reduction of swelling, concomitant compression of the spinal cord and formation of post-traumatic cysts. Thus, based on the testing in a rodent model the SOD1 DC nanozymes are promising modality for scavenging ROS, decreasing inflammation and edema, and improving recovery after SCI.","zinc","pubmed"

However, the protective function of Sal A on preserving the role of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) after spinal cord injury (SCI) is unclear. The present study investigated the effects and mechanisms of Sal A (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg, i.p.) on BSCB permeability at different time-points after compressive SCI in rats. Compared to the SCI group, treatment with Sal A decreased the content of the Evans blue in the spinal cord tissue at 24h post-SCI. The expression levels of tight junction proteins and HO-1 were remarkably increased, and that of p-caveolin-1 protein was greatly decreased after SCI Sal A. The effect of Sal A on the expression level of ZO-1, occluding, and p-caveolin-1 after SCI was blocked by the HO-1 inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP). Also, Sal A inhibited the level of apoptosis-related proteins and improved the motor function until 21days after SCI. In addition, Sal A significantly increased the expression of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in the RBMECs under hypoxia. AntagomiR-101 markedly increased the RBMECs permeability and the expression of the Cul3 protein by targeting with 3'-UTR of its mRNA. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and HO-1 was significantly increased after agomiR-101 treatment. Therefore, Sal A could improve the recovery of neurological function after SCI, which could be correlated with the repair of BSCB integrity by the miR-101/Cul3/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.","zinc","pubmed"

In the current study, we aimed to examine the possible mechanism underlying the neuro-protective effect of TMP in rat model of SCI. TMP improved locomotor functions and decreased permeability of blood-spinal cord barrier in rats with SCI, as evidenced by increase of Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores and decrease of Evans blue leakage. In addition, TMP decreased the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNFα and IL-18, reduced TUNEL-positive cells and caspase 3 and 9 activities, decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content and increased glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity in rats. All these effects were inhibited by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of HO-1, and LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt. Moreover, TMP inhibited the decrease of mRNA expression of HO-1 which was suppressed by ZnPP and LY294002. TMP inhibited the decrease of Akt phosphorylation in rats after SCI, which was suppressed by LY294002, but not ZnPP. Furthermore, LY294002, but not ZnPP, significantly inhibited TMP-induced increase of mRNA expression of Nrf2 and DNA binding activity of Nrf2 in HO-1 promoters in rat model of SCI. The data suggested that TMP induced neuro-protective effects against injury of spinal cord through the activation of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These results have appointed a new path toward the understanding of pathogenesis and TMP-related therapy of SCI and associated neurodegenerative diseases.","zinc","pubmed"

We hypothesized that delivery of AdV-ZFP-VEGF--an adenovirally delivered bio-engineered zinc-finger transcription factor that promotes endogenous VEGF-A expression--would result in angiogenesis, neuroprotection and functional recovery following SCI. This novel VEGF gene therapy induces the endogenous production of multiple VEGF-A isoforms; a critical factor for proper vascular development and repair. Briefly, female Wistar rats--under cyclosporin immunosuppression--received a 35 g clip-compression injury and were administered AdV-ZFP-VEGF or AdV-eGFP at 24 hours post-SCI. qRT-PCR and Western Blot analysis of VEGF-A mRNA and protein, showed significant increases in VEGF-A expression in AdV-ZFP-VEGF treated animals (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). Analysis of NF200, TUNEL, and RECA-1 indicated that AdV-ZFP-VEGF increased axonal preservation (p<0.05), reduced cell death (p<0.01), and increased blood vessels (p<0.01), respectively. Moreover, AdV-ZFP-VEGF resulted in a 10% increase in blood vessel proliferation (p<0.001). Catwalk™ analysis showed AdV-ZFP-VEGF treatment dramatically improves hindlimb weight support (p<0.05) and increases hindlimb swing speed (p<0.02) when compared to control animals. Finally, AdV-ZFP-VEGF administration provided a significant reduction in allodynia (p<0.01). Overall, the results of this study indicate that AdV-ZFP-VEGF administration can be delivered in a clinically relevant time-window following SCI (24 hours) and provide significant molecular and functional benefits.","zinc","pubmed"

In the current study, we demonstrate that activation of the nuclear factor-κB transcription factor within astrocytes results in a significant increase in oligodendrocyte death following trauma by reducing extracellular zinc levels and inducing glutamate excitotoxicity. By using an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (CNQX), we show that astroglial nuclear factor-κB-mediated oligodendrocyte death is dependent on glutamate signaling despite no change in extracellular glutamate concentrations. Further analysis demonstrated a reduction in levels of extracellular zinc in astrocyte cultures with functional nuclear factor-κB signaling following trauma. Cotreatment of oligodendrocytes with glutamate and zinc showed a significant increase in oligodendrocyte toxicity under low-zinc conditions, suggesting that the presence of zinc at specific concentrations can prevent glutamate excitotoxicity. These studies demonstrate a novel role for zinc in regulating oligodendrocyte excitotoxicity and identify new therapeutic targets to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death in central nervous system trauma and disease.","zinc","pubmed"

To isolate the analgesic fraction from the venom, evaluate the profile of its action on pain using preclinical nociceptive tests and determine the involvement of neurotransmitters in its action. Venom was separated with SPXL resin, and further purified by Superdex 75 and Superdex 30 resin. Its biochemical characteristics were analyzed including molecular weight (MW), isoelectric point (pI) and amino acid sequence. Animal pain models were applied including the hot plate test, acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin test, Randall-Selitto pressure test, antagonistic test, spinalized rats test and intracerebral injection test. The endogenous neuropeptides leucine-enkephalin, β-endorphin and P substance were determined by HPLC in the tissues of brain and spinal cord. An analgesic protein named pallanalgesin (MW 16.6 kDa, pI 8.8) was obtained from the venom of A. halys. It had significant antinociceptive activity in different animal pain models of thermal, chemical and mechanical stimulation. It effects both central and peripheral nerve systems, and it is related to opiate receptors and monoamines rather than acetylcholine receptors. Pallanalgesin could modulate the levels of neuropeptides in the brain and spinal cord, which contributes to the recovery of nerve injury and pain control. As a novel analgesic, pallanalgesin has been found to explain the function of the venom of A. halys on severe pain control in traditional uses, and can be used as a new analgesic in the future."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of PPAR-beta/delta in the secondary damage in experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. To this purpose, we used 4-[[[2-[3-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-methyl-5-thiazolyl]methyl]thio]-2-methylphenoxy]acetic acid (GW0742), a high-affinity PPAR-beta/delta agonist. Spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5 to T8 laminectomy. SCI in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, production of inflammatory mediators, tissue damage, and apoptosis. GW0742 treatment (0.3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) 1 and 6 h after the SCI significantly reduced 1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), 2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), 3) nitrotyrosine formation, 4) proinflammatory cytokines expression, 5) nuclear factor-kappaB activation, 6) inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, and 6) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining, FasL, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, GW0742 significantly ameliorated the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of GW0742 are related to activation of the PPAR-beta/delta receptor, we also investigated the effect of PPAR-beta/delta antagonist methyl 3-({[2-(methoxy)-4 phenyl]amino}sulfonyl)-2-thiophenecarboxylate (GSK0660) on the protective effects of GW0742. GSK0660 (1 mg/kg i.p. 30 min before treatment with GW0742) significantly blocked the effect of the PPAR-beta/delta agonist and thus abolished the protective effect. Our results clearly demonstrate that GW0742 treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma."

Gradient-recalled fast T2-weighted imaging is advocated for evaluating cervical radiculopathy. Better signal-to-noise ratios are achieved with three-dimensional Fourier transform gradient-recalled T2-weighted imaging and with decreased bandwidth acquisition. Obtaining high-contrast images of the spine is often complicated by the appearance of truncation artifacts. In outpatient radiculography, both iopamidol and iohexol appear safe, but iohexol seems better tolerated. In trauma, MR imaging is definitive, and signal abnormalities can help in evaluating neurologic recovery. Intraoperative spinal sonography may be helpful in evaluating acute injury. Enhancement with gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid is useful in the evaluation of disk space infections, osteomyelitis, and epidural abscess and in the study of spinal cord sarcoidosis. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, MR imaging may show hyperintense spine on T2-weighted images. MR imaging with gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid or gadolinium tetra-azacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid enhancement can be useful in evaluating intramedullary and intradural extramedullary tumors and for determining the extent of spinal leptomeningeal metastases. MR imaging can also be used to differentiate benign from pathologic fractures."

Rats with either type of 5,7-DHT lesions displayed supersensitive behavioral responses to 5-HTP. However, rats lesioned by i.p. injections exhibited significantly greater shaking behavior (+1445%) in response to 5-HTP than their i.c. counterparts, who instead showed more forepaw myoclonus (+250%) and head weaving (+270%), the core features of the 5-HT syndrome. Differences in 5-HT syndrome behaviors were already present 2 weeks after lesioning, whereas the difference in shaking behavior was not. After 14 weeks, 5-HT was selectively depleted (-43 to -92%) in hippocampus, spinal cord, and frontal cortex, and differences between i.c. and i.p. 5,7-DHT routes were insignificant except in frontal cortex. Brainstem 5-HT concentrations were significantly increased (+35%) after i.p. 5,7-DHT injections in contrast to reduction (-89%) after i.c. 5,7-DHT; 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HIAA/5-HT) ratios were decreased (-20%) with either route. These data suggest that brainstem 5-HT hyperinnervation following i.p. 5,7-DHT injection modifies the functional consequences of injury in abating the 5-HT syndrome, but does not result in complete recovery since shaking behavior is enhanced. Loss of presynaptically mediated autoregulation or receptor dysregulation may play a major role in behavioral supersensitivity induced by 5-HTP in rats with 5,7-DHT lesions. To the extent that the 5-HT syndrome is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors and shaking behavior by 5-HT2 sites, differential responses to injury of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to these behavioral differences."

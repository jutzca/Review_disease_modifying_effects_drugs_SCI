Decreased nNOS expression in the stomach also results from defects in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is secreted by astrocytes and has neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system. However, the roles of ApoE and enteric glial cells on gastric motility are uncertain. In this study, ApoE and enteric glial cell alterations in gastroparesis were investigated."

Gradient-recalled fast T2-weighted imaging is advocated for evaluating cervical radiculopathy. Better signal-to-noise ratios are achieved with three-dimensional Fourier transform gradient-recalled T2-weighted imaging and with decreased bandwidth acquisition. Obtaining high-contrast images of the spine is often complicated by the appearance of truncation artifacts. In outpatient radiculography, both iopamidol and iohexol appear safe, but iohexol seems better tolerated. In trauma, MR imaging is definitive, and signal abnormalities can help in evaluating neurologic recovery. Intraoperative spinal sonography may be helpful in evaluating acute injury. Enhancement with gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid is useful in the evaluation of disk space infections, osteomyelitis, and epidural abscess and in the study of spinal cord sarcoidosis. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, MR imaging may show hyperintense spine on T2-weighted images. MR imaging with gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid or gadolinium tetra-azacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid enhancement can be useful in evaluating intramedullary and intradural extramedullary tumors and for determining the extent of spinal leptomeningeal metastases. MR imaging can also be used to differentiate benign from pathologic fractures."

In vivo tracking cells using gadolinium-based contrast agents have the important advantage of providing a positive contrast on T1-weighted images, which is less likely to be confused with artifacts because of postoperative local signal voids such as metal, hemorrhage, or air. The aim of this study is to paramagnetically and fluorescently label marrow with dual agents (gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid [Gd-DTPA] and PEI-FluoR) and track them after transplantation into spinal cord injury (SCI) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of PPAR-beta/delta in the secondary damage in experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. To this purpose, we used 4-[[[2-[3-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-methyl-5-thiazolyl]methyl]thio]-2-methylphenoxy]acetic acid (GW0742), a high-affinity PPAR-beta/delta agonist. Spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T-5 to T-8 laminectomy. SCI in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, production of inflammatory mediators, tissue damage, and apoptosis. GW0742 treatment (0.3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) 1 and 6 h after the SCI significantly reduced 1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), 2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), 3) nitrotyrosine formation, 4) proinflammatory cytokines expression, 5) nuclear factor-kappa B activation, 6) inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, and 6) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining, FasL, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, GW0742 significantly ameliorated the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of GW0742 are related to activation of the PPAR-beta/delta receptor, we also investigated the effect of PPAR-beta/delta antagonist methyl-3-({[2-(methoxy)-4-phenyl]amino}sulfonyl)-2-thiophenecarboxylate (GSK0660) on the protective effects of GW0742. GSK0660 (1 mg/kg i.p. 30 min before treatment with GW0742) significantly blocked the effect of the PPAR-beta/delta agonist and thus abolished the protective effect. Our results clearly demonstrate that GW0742 treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma."

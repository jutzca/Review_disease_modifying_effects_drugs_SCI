The injury is characterized by sympathetic nervous system impairment with preservation of parasympathetic output via the vagus nerve. Severe bradycardia in the form of life-threatening sinus arrest or complete heart block may be observed in the acute recovery phase. Therapy for arrhythmias in the acute phase includes atropine, intravenous chronotropes, methylxanthines for the prevention of episodic bradycardia, and pacemaker implantation in severe cases. In the chronic recovery phase, autonomic dysreflexia in the form of paroxysmal hypertension is often induced by visceral organ distension or other stimuli and can be accompanied by bradycardia or tachycardia. The prognosis for survivors of spinal cord injury is expected to improve with further advances in surgical and medical care, and electrophysiologists will likely be called upon more frequently to help manage heart rhythm disorders in this setting."

Spinal cord transection was performed at the T-9-T-10 level 2-3 weeks prior to the experiment and a microdialysis fiber was inserted in the L-6-S-1, lumbosacral spinal cord one day before the experiments. Mechanically evoked (i.e. 10 cm/W bladder pressure) ATP release into the bladder lumen was approximately 6.5-fold higher in SCI compared to NI rats (p < 0.05). Intravesical carbachol (CCh) induced a significantly greater release of ATP in the bladder from SCI as compared to NI rats (3424.32 +/- 1255.57 pmol/ml versus 613.74 +/- 470.44 pmol/ml, respectively, p < 0.05). However, ATP release in NI or SCI rats to intravesical CCh was not affected by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Atr). Spinal release of ATP to bladder stimulation with 10 cm/W pressure was five-fold higher in SCI compared to NI rats (p < 0.05). CCh also induced a significantly greater release of spinal ATP in SCI rats compared to controls (4.3 +/- 0.9 pmol versus 0.90 +/- 0.15 pmol, p < 0.05). Surprisingly, the percent inhibitory effect of Atr on CCh-induced ATP release was less pronounced in SCI as compared to NI rats (49% versus 89%, respectively). SCI induces a dramatic increase in intravesical pressure and cholinergic receptor evoked bladder and spinal ATP release. Muscarinic receptors do not mediate intravesical CCh-induced ATP release into the bladder lumen in NI or SCI rats. In NI rats sensory muscarinic receptors are the predominant mechanism by which CCh induces ATP release from primary afferents within the lumbosacral spinal cord. Following SCL however, nicotinic or purinergic receptor mechanisms become active, as evidenced by the fact that Atr was only partially effective in inhibiting CCh-induced spinal ATP release.

This study evaluates the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 147) were fasted for 16 h and had the left jugular vein cannulated followed by laminectomy or laminectomy + complete SCT between T-4 and T-5 vertebrae. The next day, a test meal (1.5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0.5 mg/ml in 5% glucose) was administered by gavage feeding and 10 min later cervical dislocation was performed. Dye recovery in the stomach, and proximal, mid and distal small intestine was determined by spectrophotometry. SCT inhibited GE and GI transit since it increased gastric recovery by 71.3% and decreased mid small intestine recovery by 100% (P < 0.05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy + section of the splanchnic nerves, i.v. hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) prevented the development of the SCT effect on GE and GI transit. Pretreatment with i.v. naloxone (3, mg/kg), L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was ineffective. Bilateral adrenalectomy or guanethidine (10 mg/kg) increased the magnitude of the GE inhibition, while i.v. prazosin (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the magnitude but did not abolish the GE inhibition. In summary, the inhibition of GI motility observed 1 day after thoracic SCT in awake rats seems to involve vagal and possibly splanchnic pathways. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

EUS striated and urethral smooth muscle activities were elicited by reflex isovolumetric bladder contractions evoked by bladder filling or electrical stimulation of nerves in the bladder wall. Evoked EUS bursting activity in normal rats was eliminated in chronic spinal rats and replaced by tonic activity. Reflex urethral smooth muscle activity mediated by an increase in urethral pressure after paralysis of the EUS with alpha-bungarotoxin occurred in normal and chronic spinal rats. The response was significantly larger in chronic spinal (21.3+/-3.0 cmH(2)O) than in normal rats (4.2+/-0.7 cmH(2)O). N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 20 mg/kg iv) increased the smooth muscle response in normal (5.9+/-1.3 cmH(2)O) and chronic spinal rats (6.9+/-1.8 cmH(2)O). This increase in urethral pressure was not changed by sympathetic nerve transection or prazosin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg iv) but was abolished by hexamethonium and reduced 74-89% by atropine. These results indicate that coordinated EUS function (bursting activity) in the male rat is dependent on supraspinal pathways and that the urethral smooth muscle response during voiding is composed of a predominant cholinergic, atropine-sensitive contraction as well as a nitric oxide-mediated relaxation. Both are mediated by activation of parasympathetic pathways and are maintained or significantly larger after spinal cord injury, indicating that they are dependent on spinal reflex pathways."

Now, we repeated these treatments and performed 2 independent Illumina RNA-Sequencing studies in the brainstems of control and GABA or baclofen treated animals. GABA treated larval sea lampreys with their controls were analyzed 29 days after a complete spinal cord injury and baclofen treated larvae with their controls 9 days after the injury. One of the most significantly downregulated genes after both treatments was a HES gene (HESB). HES proteins are transcription factors that are key mediators of the Notch signaling pathway and gamma-secretase activity is crucial for the activation of this pathway. So, based on the RNA-Seq results we subsequently treated spinal cord injured larval sea lampreys with a novel gamma-secretase inhibitor (PF-3804014). This treatment also reduced the expression of HESB in the brainstem and significantly enhanced the regeneration of individually identifiable descending neurons after a complete spinal cord injury. Our results show that gamma-secretase could be a novel target to promote axon regeneration after nervous system injuries."

The present study was aimed at evaluating the locomotor recovery efficacy and safety of the neurotrophin BDNF delivered intrathecally to the lumbar locomotor centers using an implantable and programmable infusion mini-pump. Results showed that BDNF treated spinal cats recovered weight-bearing plantar stepping at all velocities tested (0.3-0.8 m/s).

Objectives Spasticity is a common complication after spinal cord injury (SCI) and has detrimental aspects, such as persistent pain and involuntary muscle spasms. This study aimed to assess the influence of antispastic therapy on locomotor function after SCI. Setting University-based laboratory in Fukuoka, Japan. Methods A mouse model of spasticity was developed by producing incomplete SCI at the 9th thoracic level. At 8 weeks after SCI, an antispastic drug, baclofen, was intraperitoneally administered to six injured and two sham-operated mice. The severity of spasticity was evaluated by the modified Ashworth scoring (MAS) system, and locomotor function was evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale/Basso mouse score (BMS). Results The administration of baclofen significantly improved spasticity in the SCI mice and the mean MAS decreased to from 6.2 to 2.8. However, at the same time, it significantly exacerbated the locomotor dysfunction of the SCI mice and the mean BMS decreased from 4.7 to 2.3. The time-course of the changes in locomotor function coincided with the time-course of the spasticity score. We also confirmed that the administration of baclofen was not associated with any changes in either locomotor function or spasticity of the sham-operated control mice. Conclusions Our results suggest that spasticity has a certain beneficial effect on ambulation ability. It is important to note that antispastic treatments may be associated with a risk of impairing the preserved function of chronic SCI patients."

This study was performed on 32 stroke patients. The patients are assigned to three groups (intervention, sham, and control). All participants in the first two groups received 20-min concurrent M1 a-tDCS or sham tDCS and functional electrical stimulation (FES) for 10 sessions (5 sessions per week), while participants in control group were given only 20-min FES for 10 sessions. Modified Ashworth scale of wrist flexors and also electromyography (EMG) activity of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) were recorded before, immediately, and 1 month after the interventions. A significant reduction was shown in the MAS and EMG activity of FCR muscle at passive rest position of the wrist, immediately and 1 month after the intervention in M1 a-tDCS compared to sham and control groups (p < 0.001). Also, the EMG activity of FCR and ECR muscles during active wrist flexion and extension increased immediately and 1 month after intervention in M1 a-tDCS compared to the other groups, respectively (p < 0.001). M1 a-tDCS can significantly decrease the spasticity of wrist flexor muscle and also increase the wrist flexor and extensor muscles activity in stroke patients during active flexion and extension."

The degree of consciousness varies from coma to vegetative state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state. Correct diagnosis has important ethical and legal implications, and pain may be cause of misdiagnosis. We describe here a patient with traumatic brain injury, classified as UWS. His clinical picture was dominated by spasticity, and pain. He underwent intrathecal treatment of spasticity with baclofen. Improvement was not that expected. However, there was a dramatic improvement when ziconotide was added to relieve pain; the patient began to eat by mouth, talk, and his tracheal tube could be removed and he is currently classified as having severe disability. The suspension of ziconotide caused a clear re-worsening of clinical condition, reverted by his reintroduction. Pain is an important factor in patients with DOC. Anecdotal reports of improved consciousness with intrathecal baclofen therapy may be due to pain relief Reduction of pain in DOC is important and drugs should not interfere with cognition, and must be effective and manageable. Ziconotide may be one of the possible candidate due to its synergistic antispastic action in combination with baclofen when an intratecal pump has been implanted."

We performed a secondary longitudinal analysis of a cohort of adult patients with traumatic acute spinal cord injury. Cumulative baclofen dose was computed over the first 4 weeks following injury from concomitant medication information from a completed clinical trial. The main outcome measure was neurologic status, which was assessed over 52 weeks with ""marked recovery"" defined as the conversion to higher sensory and motor function. To complete the drug safety profile, drug toxicity was assessed with assays from standard blood work. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of the cohort (n = 651), 18% (n = 115) received baclofen within 4 weeks post injury. Baclofen use was associated with higher rates of marked neurologic recovery, even after adjustment for injury severity (HR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0 for high dose vs none). Baclofen exposure was not associated with liver or renal side effects. The use of other medications indicated for spasticity was not associated with neurological outcomes. Overall, this longitudinal analysis provides level 3 evidence on the neurologic safety of baclofen and potential beneficial effects on recovery in the early days after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The usefulness of concomitant medication files from completed clinical trials is highlighted. We also highlight the importance of incorporating logical patient questions and neurological outcomes into research addressing drug safety."

Previous work has described adaptations in spinal systems that might underlie this hyperexcitability, including an increase in constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors in spinal motoneurons. That work, however, examined adaptations following complete transection SCI, whereas SCI in humans is usually anatomically and functionally incomplete. We therefore evaluated whether constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors contributes to reflex hyperexcitability in an incomplete compression model of SCI and to spasms in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm that 5-HT2C receptor constitutive activity contributes to reflex excitability after incomplete SCI. We also evaluated whether constitutive activity could be altered by manipulation of neural activity levels after SCI, testing the hypothesis that it reflects homeostatic processes acting to maintain spinal excitability. We decreased neural activity after SCI by administering baclofen and increased activity by administering the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. We found that drug administration produced minimal alterations in in vivo locomotor function or reflex excitability. Similarly, we found that neither baclofen nor fluoxetine altered the contribution of constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors to reflexes after SCI, although the contribution of 5-HT2C receptors to reflex activity was altered after SSRIs. These results confirm the importance of constitutive activity in 5-HT2C receptors to spinal hyperexcitability following SCI in the clinically relevant case of incomplete SCI but suggest that this activity is not driven by homeostatic processes that act to maintain overall levels of spinal excitability."

To test this hypothesis, we examined motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the leg representation of the primary motor cortex, maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), and the StartReact response (shortening in reaction time evoked by a startling stimulus) in the quadriceps femoris muscle in male and females with and without incomplete SCI. A total of 66.7% of the SCI participants showed symptoms of spasticity, whereas the other 333% showed no or low levels of spasticity. We found that participants with spasticity had smaller MEPs and MVCs and larger StartReact compared with participants with no or low spasticity and control subjects. These results were consistently present in spastic subjects but not in the other populations. Clinical scores of spasticity were negatively correlated with MEP-max and MVC values and positively correlated with shortening in reaction time. These findings provide evidence for lesser corticospinal and larger reticulospinal influences to spastic muscles in humans with SCI and suggest that these imbalanced contributions are important for motor recovery."

We investigated the effects of pharmacological and physical (locomotor training) interventions on function in people living with incomplete motor function loss caused by SCI and used different analytical techniques to understand whether functional levels affect recovery with different interventions. Methods. Participants with an incomplete SCI were assigned to 3 groups: no intervention, Lokomat, or tizanidine. Outcome measures were the 10-m walk test, 6-minute walk test, and the Timed Up and Go. Participants were classified in 2 ways: (1) based on achieving an improvement above the minimally important difference (MID) and (2) using growth mixture modeling (GMM). Functional levels of participants who achieved the MID were compared and random coefficient regression (RCR) was used to assess recovery in GMM classes. Results. Overall, walking speed and endurance improved, with no difference between interventions. Only a small number of participants achieved the MID. Both MID and GMM-RCR analyses revealed that tizanidine improved endurance in high-functioning participants. GMM-RCR classification also showed that speed and mobility improved after locomotor training. Conclusions. Improvements in function were achieved in a limited number of people with SCI. Using the MID and GMM techniques, differences in responses to interventions between high-and low-functioning participants could be identified. These techniques may, therefore, have potential to be used for characterizing therapeutic effects resulting from different interventions."

Thus, it is of crucial importance to find ways to promote axonal regeneration. In addition, the prevention of retrograde degeneration leading to the atrophy/death of descending neurons is an obvious prerequisite to activate axonal regeneration. Lampreys show an amazing regenerative capacity after SCI. Recent histological work in lampreys suggested that GABA, which is massively released after a SCI, could promote the survival of descending neurons. Here, we aimed to study if GABA, acting through GABAB receptors, promotes the survival and axonal regeneration of descending neurons of larval sea lampreys after a complete SCI. First, we used in situ hybridization to confirm that identifiable descending neurons of late-stage larvae express the gabab1 subunit of the GABAB receptor. We also observed an acute increase in the expression of this subunit in descending neurons after SCI, which further supported the possible role of GABA and GABAB receptors in promoting the survival and regeneration of these neurons. So, we performed gain and loss of function experiments to confirm this hypothesis. Treatments with GABA and baclofen (GABAB agonist) significantly reduced caspase activation in descending neurons 2 weeks after a complete SCI. Long-term treatments with GABOB (a GABA analogue) and baclofen significantly promoted axonal regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. These data indicate that GABAergic signalling through GABAB receptors promotes the survival and regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. Finally, we used morpholinos against the gabab1 subunit to knockdown the expression of the GABAB receptor in descending neurons. Long-term morpholino treatments caused a significant inhibition of axonal regeneration. This shows that endogenous GABA promotes axonal regeneration after a complete SCI in lampreys by activating GABAB receptors."

We induced photothrombotic injury in the rostral and caudal forelimb motor areas of mice and used the rate-dependent depression (RDD) of Hoffmann's reflex (H-reflex) as an indicator of spastic symptoms. To detect motoneuron excitability, we examined c-fos mRNA levels and c-Fos immunoreactivity in affected motoneurons using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. To confirm the validity of our model, we confirmed the effect of the anti-spasticity drug baclofen on H-reflex RDDs 1 week post stroke. We found that 3 days after stroke, the RDD was significantly weakened in the affected muscles of stroke mice compared with sham-operated mice, and this was observed for 8 weeks. The c-fos mRNA levels in affected motoneurons were significantly increased in stroke mice compared with sham-operated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of c-Fos-positive motoneurons in stroke mice compared with sham-operated mice at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after stroke; however, the number of c-Fos-positive motoneurons on both sides of the brain gradually decreased over time. Baclofen treatment resulted in recovery of the weakened RDD at 1 week post stroke. Our findings suggest that this is a viable animal model of post-stroke spasticity."

Reorganization following spinal cord injury is known to evoke changes at the cortical and spinal cord levels. Recent studies, however, provide evidence of enhanced brainstem reflexes and alterations in excitatory and inhibitory interneuronal brainstem circuits, suggesting that reorganization following spinal cord injury occurs also at the brainstem level. Reversal of these changes by continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion to normal levels or beyond indicates strong GABAergic involvement. Rapid changes in the blink reflex and its prepulse inhibition following intrathecal baclofen bolus application that parallel clinical changes in muscle hypertonia suggest a muscle tone regulating effect of baclofen at the brainstem level. Enhanced brainstem reflexes in spinal cord injury patients may be the consequence of decreased GABA-mediated inhibition and/or strengthening of facilitatory connections due to either direct or indirect plastic changes occurring at the brainstem level. Modulation of brainstem reflexes by baclofen may foster the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying diseases with increased brainstem activity.

The recent National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) showed that very high dose methylprednisolone given within 8 hr after injury improves neurologic recovery. The mechanism is believed to be inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Many other drugs have been claimed to be beneficial in animal studies, including other lipid peroxidation inhibitors, free radical scavengers, opiate receptor blockers, NMDA receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, and protease inhibitors. In chronic spinal cord injury, much progress also has been made. Myelin was found to possess factors that inhibit axonal regeneration. Blocking these factors enhances spinal cord regeneration. Monosialic gangliosides (GM1) were recently found to improve neurologic recovery in spinal-cord-injured patients. Given as late as 48-72 hr after injury, the mechanism of action is not well understood. However, the GM1 results give hope that recovery mechanisms can be manipulated pharmacologically. Nonregenerative therapy for chronic spinal cord injury is also being developed. Several drugs, including 4-aminopyridine and baclofen, respectively blockers of potassium channels and GABA-B receptors, improve conduction in demyelinated axons. These drugs may be useful for identifying patients who might benefit from remyelination therapy. Finally, NASCIS has complicated acute spinal cord injury studies. To bring a drug to clinical trial, an investigator must now determine the optimal treatment dose, timing, and duration over a range of injury severities, in comparison and combination with methylprednisolone. This requirement has so increased the scale of drug testing that multicenter laboratory trials may be necessary."

Anatomical discontinuity in the spinal cord results in disruption of the impulse conduction that causes temporary or permanent changes in the cord's normal functions. Although axonal regeneration is limited, damage to the spinal cord is often accompanied by spontaneous plasticity and axon regeneration that help improve sensory and motor skills. The recovery process depends mainly on synaptic plasticity in the preexisting circuits and on the formation of new pathways through collateral sprouting into neighboring denervated territories. However, spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury can go on for several years, and the degree of recovery is very limited. Therefore, the development of new approaches that could accelerate the gain of motor function is of high priority to patients with damaged spinal cord. Although there are no fully restorative treatments for spinal injury, various rehabilitative approaches have been tested in animal models and have reached clinical trials. In this paper, a closer look will be given at the potential therapies that could facilitate axonal regeneration and improve locomotor recovery after injury to the spinal cord. This article highlights the application of several interventions including locomotor training, molecular and cellular treatments, and spinal cord stimulation in the field of rehabilitation research. Studies investigating therapeutic approaches in both animal models and individuals with injured spinal cords will be presented."

This article reviews a series of studies published during the last decade that used rTMS in the acute and chronic stages of paraplegia and tetraplegia in humans with complete and incomplete SCI. In the studies, rTMS has been applied over the arm and leg representations of the primary motor cortex to target 3 main consequences of SCI: sensory and motor function impairments, spasticity, and neuropathic pain. Although some studies demonstrated that consecutive sessions of rTMS improve aspects of particular functions, other studies did not show similar effects. We discuss how rTMS parameters and postinjury reorganization in the corticospinal tract, motor cortical, and spinal cord circuits might be critical factors in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using rTMS in patients with SCI. The available data highlight the limited information on the use of rTMS after SCI and the need to further understand the pathophysiology of neuronal structures affected by rTMS to maximize the potential beneficial effects of this technique in humans with SCI.

Structural or functional injuries may produce impairments in the neuronal circuits (the ascending reticular activating system and thalamocortical loops) responsible for maintaining the wakefulness state and awareness, associated with a change in neurotransmitter concentrations. Pharmacological agents that are able to restore the levels of neurotransmitters and, consequently, neural synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity of consciousness networks, may play an important role as drugs useful in improving the consciousness state. Currently, there is growing interest in the scientific community with regard to pharmacological agents that act on the gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) system, such as zolpidem and baclofen, and monoamine systems, such as dopaminergic agents and some antidepressants. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of these potential 'awakening' drugs in patients with disorders of consciousness. The possible mechanisms by which these drugs may exert their effects in promoting recovery of consciousness are discussed, highlighting how many findings are often the result of sporadic events rather than prospective controlled trials or implementation of standard treatment guidelines."

Both parameters were studied in patients with SCI without baclofen treatment (n = 19), in patients with continuous intrathecal baclofen (CITB) (n = 9), and in healthy controls (n = 13). R2 recovery, expressed as the ratio of R2 area following the second stimulus divided by the R2 area following the first stimulus, was significantly greater in SCI patients without baclofen compared to controls and patients with CITB at all intervals, while there was no difference between patients with CITB and controls. Prepulse inhibition of R2 was significantly less in patients without baclofen compared to patients with CITB and healthy controls. Our findings indicate enhanced excitability and reduced inhibition of brainstem interneuronal circuits in patients with SCI, that are restored in the presence of baclofen to levels comparable to controls. In conclusion, SCI patients show more extended alterations in brainstem circuitry than previously thought. Decreased GABAergic mechanisms seem to be related to both excitatory and inhibitory brainstem circuit alterations. Baclofen appears to effectively restore this decreased GABAeregic activity."

In the placebo-TENS group, electrodes were placed but no electrical stimulation was administered. For measuring spasticity, the resistance encountered during passive muscle stretching of ankle joint was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the Hand held dynamometer was used to assess the resistive force caused by spasticity. Balance ability was measured using a force platform that measures postural sway generated by postural imbalance. The TENS group showed a significantly greater reduction in spasticity of the gastrocnemius, compared to the placebo-TENS group (p < 0.05). TENS resulted in greater balance ability improvements, especially during the eyes closed condition (p < 0.05). However, these effects returned to baseline values within one day.

Because the half-life time of GABA is very short in vivo, GABA itself is not used for clinical practice. An analogue of GABA, baclofen, is an agonist of GABA-B receptor, and has very strong antispastic effect by acting to the posterior horn of the spinal cord. However, baclofen poorly crosses through the blood brain barrier, and the antispastic effect is modest when administered orally. Therefore, direct continuous infusion of small doses of baclofen into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal baclofen therapy, ITB) has become an established treatment for control of otherwise intractable severe spasticity. Spasticity is clinically defined as hypertonic state of the muscles with increased tendon reflexes, muscles spasm, spasm pain, abnormal posture, and limitation of involuntary movements. Spasticity is a common symptom after damage mainly to the pyramidal tract system in the brain or the spinal cord. Such damage is caused by traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and so on. Patients in persistent vegetative state (PVS) usually have diffuse and widespread damage to the brain, spasticity is generally seen in such patients. Control of spasticity may become important in the management of PVS patients in terms of nursing care, pain relief, and hygiene, and ITB may be indicated. Among PVS patients who had ITB to control spasticity, sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from PVS after ITB have been reported worldwide. The mechanism of such recovery of consciousness is poorly understood, and it may simply be a coincidence. On the other hand, electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been tried for many years in many patients in PVS, and some positive effects on recovery of consciousness have been reported. SCS is usually indicated for control of neuropathic pain, but it has also antispastic effect. The mechanism of SCS on pain is known to be mediated through the spinal GABA neuronal system. Thus, ITB and SCS have a common background, spinal GABA neuronal mechanism. The effect of GABA agonists on recovery of consciousness is not yet established, but review of such case studies becomes a clue to solve problems in PVS, and there may be hidden serendipity."

Since benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat muscle spasticity in spinal cord injured subjects and the gamma 2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is necessary for benzodiazepine binding, this subunit may be an important factor modulating sensorimotor function after an injury. Changes in gamma 2 levels in muscle-specific motoneurons and surrounding astrocytes were determined similar to 3 months after a complete mid-thoracic spinal cord transection at P5 in non-trained and in step-trained spinal rats. Soleus (ankle extensor) and tibialis anterior (TA, ankle flexor) motor pools were identified using retrograde labeling via intramuscular injections of Fast Blue or Fluoro Gold, respectively. Lumbar spinal cord sections showed gamma 2 immunostaining in both soleus and TA motoneurons and astrocytes. gamma 2 immunoreactivity on the soma of soleus and TA motoneurons in spinal rats was differentially modulated. Compared to intact rats, spinal rats had higher levels of gamma 2 in TA, and lower levels in soleus motoneurons. Step training restored GABA(A) gamma 2 levels towards control values in motoneuronal pools of both muscles. In contrast, the gamma 2 levels were elevated in surrounding astrocytes of both motor pools in spinal rats, and step training had no further effect. Thus, motor training had a specific effect on those neurons that were directly involved with the motor task. Since the gamma 2 subunit is involved with GABA(A) receptor trafficking and synaptic clustering, it appears that this subunit could be an important component of the activity-dependent response of the spinal cord after a spinal injury.

First published December 5, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00821.2012.-In animals, the recovery of motoneuron excitability in the months following a complete spinal cord injury is mediated, in part, by increases in constitutive serotonin (5-HT2) and norepinephrine (alpha(1)) receptor activity, which facilitates the reactivation of calcium-mediated persistent inward currents (CaPICs) without the ligands serotonin and norepinephrine below the injury. In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/alpha(1) receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and alpha(1) receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal."

Injury was assessed by recording pre- and postanoxic compound action potentials (CAPs). GABA (1 mu M) significantly increased postanoxic CAP recovery when applied 60 min prior to anoxia. This effect was bicuculline (100 mu M) insensitive, mimicked by baclofen (1 mu M), blocked by GABA-B antagonists, and not mimicked by selective GABA-A agonists. GABA therefore acted at GABA-B receptors. High concentrations of GABA and baclofen did not influence recovery, possibly indicating GABA-B receptor desensitization at high agonist concentrations."

Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently prescribed for spasticity but its effects on walking have not been well quantified. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen on walking in SCI subjects with incomplete injuries. A motorized treadmill was used and harness support provided when necessary. A repeated single-subject design was employed for the twelve subjects. The greatest effects were found in more severely disabled subjects. Cyproheptadine was associated with greatly reduced need for assistance, increases in maximum treadmill speed (MTS) and reduced clonus. Clonidine was associated with increases in MTS and a generally more upright posture. Baclofen was associated with minor changes in walking. In many cases of drug effects, MTS increases and other changes were retained following washout of drugs. The significance and implications of the drug effects and the retention of effects during washout periods are discussed. It is concluded that clonidine and cyproheptadine have different effects but both appear useful for severely disabled SCI subjects. The effects of baclofen on walking after spinal cord injury remains unclear."

This provides a rational basis for the rehabilitation and pharmacotherapy of locomotion in spinal cord-injured patients. Findings in the field of locomotor training, locomotor pharmacotherapy, and functional electrical stimulation are reviewed. It is argued that a combination of the various approaches will provide an optimal base for functional locomotor recovery."

This lack of regeneration is crucially influenced by neurite growth inhibitory protein constituents of CNS myelin. We have shown previously that a monoclonal antibody (mAb IN-1) capable of binding and neutralizing Nogo-A, a myelin-associated inhibitor of neurite growth, can induce long-distance axonal regeneration and increased structural plasticity with improved functional recovery in rat models of CNS injury. In this paper we demonstrate that a partially humanized, recombinant Fab fragment (rIN-1 Fab) derived from the original mAb IN-1, was able to promote long-distance regeneration of injured axons in the spinal cord of adult rats. When infused into a spinal cord injury site, regrowth of corticospinal fibers in 11 of 18 animals was observed after a survival time of 2 weeks. Regenerating fibers grew for >9 mm beyond the lesion site and arborized profusely in the distal cord. Regenerated fibers formed terminal arbors with varicosities in the spinal cord gray matter, strongly resembling synaptic points of contact to neurons in the spinal cord distal to the lesion. In animals that had received a bovine serum albumin solution or a recombinant IN-1 fragment that had been mutated in the antigen binding site (mutIN-1 Fab), no significant growth beyond normal lesion-induced sprouting was observed. Neutralization of endogenous nerve growth inhibitors represents a novel use of recombinant antibody technology with potential therapeutic applications after traumatic CNS lesions."

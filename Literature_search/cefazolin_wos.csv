Proper treatment of a UTI is important with myelopathy because it is a risk factor for persistent infection and reinfection in dogs. The study authors' investigated the incidence of UTIs in dogs having received either cefovecin or cefazolin as a preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for thoracolumbar hemilaminectomy. Thirty-nine dogs were retrospectively identified and assigned to groups based on preoperative antibiotic administration and postoperative urinary tract management. Urinalysis and urine culture performed preoperatively, at 2 wk, and at 6 wk, were reviewed to determine the incidence of UTIs. Urinary tract management, grade of neurologic deficit, time to ambulation, and time to voluntary urination were identified to evaluate for additional risk factors. No significant prevalence of UTI incidence was appreciated between the cefovecin and cefazolin groups. Patients with higher grades of neurologic deficit and that took longer to regain ambulation and voluntary urination were at significantly greater risk for UTIs throughout the postoperative period. This study reemphasizes the importance of continued surveillance for UTIs in patients with prolonged neurologic recovery."

The objective of this retrospective case-control study was to identify risk factors for PMM by comparing dogs with complete sensorimotor loss following IVDE that did and did not develop the disease after surgery. We also investigated whether any risk factors for PMM influenced return of ambulation. Medical records of client-owned dogs with paraplegia and loss of pain perception that underwent surgery for IVDE from 1998 to 2016, were reviewed. Dogs were categorized as PMM yes or no based on clinical progression or histopathology. Walking outcome at 6 months was established. Signalment, onset and duration of signs (categorized), steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (yes or no), site of IVDE (lumbar intumescence or thoracolumbar) and longitudinal extent of IVDE were retrieved and their associations with PMM and walking outcome were examined using logistic regression. One hundred and ninety seven dogs were included, 45 with and 152 without PMM. A 6-month-outcome was available in 178 dogs (all 45 PMM dogs and 133 control dogs); 86 recovered walking (all in the control group). Disc extrusions at the lumbar intumescence were associated with PMM (p = 0.01, OR: 3.02, CI: 1.3-7.2). Surgery performed more than 12 h after loss of ambulation was associated with PMM (OR = 3.4; CI = 1.1-10.5, p = 0.03 for 12-24 h and OR = 4.6; CI = 1.3-16.6, p = 0.02 for the > 24 h categories when compared with the ≤12 h category). Treatment with corticosteroids was negatively associated with PMM (OR: 3.1; CI: 1.3-7.6, p = 0.01). The only variable to affect walking outcome was longitudinal extent of IVDE (OR = 2.6; CI = 1.3-5.3, p = 0.006). Dogs with lumbar intumescence IVDE are at increased risk of PMM. Timing of surgery and corticosteroid use warrant further investigations. PMM and recovery of walking are influenced by different factors."

Patients often present with a history of progressive pain, paralysis, sensory loss, progressive spinal deformity, and loss of sphincter control. It is an emergency that requires rapid decision making on the part of several specialists, given the risk of permanent spinal cord injury or death. The goals of treatment in spinal metastases are pain control and improvement of neurological function in order to achieve better quality of life (QoL). The standard of care in most cases is rapid initiation of corticosteroids in combination with either surgical decompression in case of an operable candidate, followed by radiation therapy (RT) or RT alone. Surgery is associated with improved outcomes, but is not appropriate for many patients presenting with advanced symptoms of MSCC, such as paralysis, or those with a poor performance status, or cachexic state, as well as altered mental conditions, co-morbidities, surgical risks, and limited life expectancy. On the other hand, aggressive surgical treatment and post-operative RT is advocated for those with more favorable prognosis, or who are expected to have higher neurological recovery potential. Many candidates may require for combined anterior and posterior approaches to effectively deal with the compressive pathology and stabilize the spine. Most patients are presently treated by primary RT, given with the aim of improving function and symptom management. However, there is still debate regarding the most appropriate RT schedule. Rehabilitation can serve to relieve symptoms, QoL, enhance functional independence, and prevent further complications. Ambulatory status has been found to be an important prognostic factor for patients with MSCC."

Spinal cord injury greatly affects a patient's mental and physical conditions and causes substantial economic impact to society. There are many methods, such as high doses of corticosteroids, surgical stabilization, decompression, and stem cell transplantation, for functional recovery after SCI, but the effect is still not satisfactory. This study investigated the role of neuronal regeneration and the location of the neuronal regeneration after SCI in rats. This is an experimental animal study of acute spinal cord injury investigating the neuronal regeneration after SCI. Double immunofluorescence staining of NF-200 and BrdU was performed to detect the location of the neuronal regeneration. Forty-five adult Wistar rats were tested. Allen hit model (10 g) induced acute SCI sites targeted at the T10 segments. Nestin expression was detected via immunohistochemistry. Double immunofluorescence staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was performed 10 mm away from the spinal cord center. Neural functional recovery was determined using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score and electro-physiological examination. The study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 81272172). The funder of this study had no capacity to influence the scholarly conduct of the research, interpretation of results, or dissemination of study outcomes. BrdU- and NF-200-positive cells were rarely detected and absent at 3 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. We also detected the BrdU and NF-200 co-expressed cells are at 3 to 5 mm away from the injured site, and no co-expressed cells were detected at the injured site in this SCI model. The BBB score and electro-physiological examination of the nervous system were significantly different at 4 weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that neurons are regenerated 3 to 5 mm away from the injured site, and no neurons are regenerated at the injured site in this SCI model, which suggests a novel train of thought on SCI treatment."

In recent years, there have been improvements in the early recognition and prompt resuscitation of patients with neurologic trauma. However, there remain few pharmacologic treatments to reduce its secondary complications. Corticosteroids have been used in patients with neurologic trauma for more than 5 decades. Traditionally, their use has been to improve motor and sensory recovery. However, recently their utility to prevent and manage trauma-related pneumonia has been investigated. Given these new investigations, the purpose of this review article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the history and available scientific evidence surrounding the use of corticosteroids in neurologic trauma and caution against the use of these agents to prevent hospital-acquired pneumonia in this patient population."

To describe a unique presentation of abrupt spinal cord injury in this condition. Vertebral fractures occur frequently in osteoporosis, but associated spinal cord injury is a rare occurrence. When neurologic injury occurs it is generally of a very low incidence and with a gradual onset, and spontaneous recovery can be expected. Most reports in the literature are of delayed-onset paraplegia after vertebral collapse. We report a unique case of a sudden and catastrophic thoracic spinal cord injury occurring spontaneously. An 88-year-old woman had a sudden thoracic vertebral fracture with complete spinal cord injury while attempting to get out of bed. She was treated with continuous oral corticosteroids for >40 years for both rheumatoid arthritis and restrictive lung disease. She was never investigated or treated for osteoporosis. Plain radiographs indicated multilevel osteoporotic fractures throughout the spine with diffuse, marked osteopenia. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed changes in keeping with severe vertebral osteoporosis and spinal cord injury. She was treated nonoperatively in view of the extremely osteoporotic spine and her overall poor medical condition. Despite an initial improvement in her respiratory condition with medical therapy, she died 72 hours following admission. With increasing awareness of the morbidity attached to the osteoporotic spine, investigation and pharmacologic treatment are warranted and may reduce the possibility of catastrophic neurologic impairment as occurred in this case."

Through an understanding of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the evolution of SCI, treatments aimed at ameliorating neural damage may be developed. The possible pharmacologic treatments for acute spinal cord injury are herein reviewed. Myriad treatment modalities, including corticosteroids, 21-aminosteroids, opioid receptor antagonists, gangliosides, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TRH analogs, antioxidants and free radical scavengers, calcium channel blockers, magnesium replacement therapy, sodium channel blockers, N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-kainate receptor antagonists, modulators of arachadonic acid metabolism, neurotrophic growth factors, serotonin antagonists, antibodies against inhibitors of axonal regeneration, potassium channel blockers (4-aminopyridine), paclitaxel, clenbuterol, progesterone, gabexate mesylate, activated protein C, caspase inhibitors, tacrolimus, antibodies against adhesion molecules, and other immunomodulatory therapy have been studied to date. Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment. This first decade of the new millennium, now touted as the Decade of the Spine, will hopefully witness the emergence of universal and efficacious pharmacologic therapy and ultimately a cure for SCI."

The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring system was used on admission and at follow-up to determine change in neurological status. Treatment with corticosteroids or surgical intervention had no significant effect on outcome. Tetraplegics, both complete and incomplete, had a significantly better outcome than paraplegics (p < 0.02). Incomplete cord injury carried a better prognosis of motor recovery (p < 0.0001). Pattern of injury was an important determinant of recovery in the complete tetraplegia group. We conclude that many factors influence recovery following spinal cord injury and the effect of treatment may be difficult to demonstrate."

Diagnosis of RSD was based upon clinical, roentgenographic and scintigraphic findings. Management of RSD included elevation of forearm and hands, gentle active and passive range of movements of all upper extremity joints and systemic corticosteroids. With treatment, pain subsided, the range of motion of the joints improved and the patient achieved good functional recovery."

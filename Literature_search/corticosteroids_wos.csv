Study Design A prospective controlled animal study. Setting An animal laboratory. Subjects and Methods Facial paralysis was induced in 32 Wistar rats that we then divided into 4 groups: group 1, control; group 2, bumetanide; group 3, dexamethasone; group 4, bumetanide and dexamethasone. Electroneurography was performed 1, 2, and 4 weeks later, and nerve regeneration was evaluated by electron and light microscopy and Western blotting in week 4. Results Regarding the comparison between preoperative values and week 4, the latency difference in group 1 (1.25 milliseconds) was significantly higher than those of groups 2 to 4 (0.56, 0.34, and 0.10 milliseconds, respectively;P= .001). The latency increment in groups 2 and 3 was higher than that of group 4 (P= .002 andP= .046) in week 4, whereas groups 2 and 3 did not differ significantly (P= .291). Amplitude difference was not statistically significant from week 4 among all groups (allP >.05). The number of myelinated axons was significantly higher in all treatment groups than in the control group (P= .001). Axon number and intensity were significantly higher in group 4 as compared with groups 2 and 3 (P= .009,P= .005). Conclusion After primary neurorrhaphy, dexamethasone and bumetanide alone promoted nerve recovery based on electrophysiologic and histologic measures. Combination therapy was, however, superior."

The objective of this retrospective case-control study was to identify risk factors for PMM by comparing dogs with complete sensorimotor loss following IVDE that did and did not develop the disease after surgery. We also investigated whether any risk factors for PMM influenced return of ambulation. Medical records of client-owned dogs with paraplegia and loss of pain perception that underwent surgery for IVDE from 1998 to 2016, were reviewed. Dogs were categorized as PMM yes or no based on clinical progression or histopathology. Walking outcome at 6 months was established. Signalment, onset and duration of signs (categorized), steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (yes or no), site of IVDE (lumbar intumescence or thoracolumbar) and longitudinal extent of IVDE were retrieved and their associations with PMM and walking outcome were examined using logistic regression."

There is little controversy over the practice of using steroids in the treatment of optic neuritis-it is well established that intravenous steroid treatment can speed visual recovery but does not alter final visual function. However, there is controversy surrounding the acceptable routes of administration, dosage, and course of treatment. Additionally, the typical patient with optic neuritis is young and otherwise healthy, and thus is likely to tolerate steroids well. In ischemic and traumatic causes of optic neuropathies, the initial injury is not inflammatory, but damage may be compounded by secondary injury due to resultant inflammation and swelling in the confined space of the optic canal. Steroids have been considered as a means of minimizing inflammation and swelling, and thus minimizing the secondary injury that results. However, the use of steroids in traumatic and ischemic optic neuropathies is highly controversial-the evidence for the efficacy of treatment with steroids is insufficient to show that there is significant benefit. Additionally, patients with these conditions are more likely to have comorbidities that make them vulnerable to significant adverse events with the use of steroids. In this article, we attempt to analyze the current state of the literature regarding the use of steroids in the treatment of optic neuropathies, specifically optic neuritis, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and traumatic optic neuropathy."

Patients often present with a history of progressive pain, paralysis, sensory loss, progressive spinal deformity, and loss of sphincter control. It is an emergency that requires rapid decision making on the part of several specialists, given the risk of permanent spinal cord injury or death. The goals of treatment in spinal metastases are pain control and improvement of neurological function in order to achieve better quality of life (QoL). The standard of care in most cases is rapid initiation of corticosteroids in combination with either surgical decompression in case of an operable candidate, followed by radiation therapy (RT) or RT alone. Surgery is associated with improved outcomes, but is not appropriate for many patients presenting with advanced symptoms of MSCC, such as paralysis, or those with a poor performance status, or cachexic state, as well as altered mental conditions, comorbidities, surgical risks, and limited life expectancy. On the other hand, aggressive surgical treatment and post-operative RT is advocated for those with more favorable prognosis, or who are expected to have higher neurological recovery potential. Many candidates may require for combined anterior and posterior approaches to effectively deal with the compressive pathology and stabilize the spine. Most patients are presently treated by primary RT, given with the aim of improving function and symptom management. However, there is still debate regarding the most appropriate RT schedule. Rehabilitation can serve to relieve symptoms, QoL, enhance functional independence, and prevent further complications. Ambulatory status has been found to be an important prognostic factor for patients with MSCC."

Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, a spice known for its medicinal and anti-inflammatory properties, has been validated to harbor immense effects for a multitude of inflammatory-based diseases. However, to date there has not been a review on curcumin's effects on SCI. Herein, we systematically review all known data on this topic and juxtapose results of curcumin with standard therapies such as corticosteroids. Because all studies that compare the two show superior results for curcumin over corticosteroids, it could be true that curcumin better acts at the inflammatory source of SCI-mediated neurological injury, although this question remains unanswered in patients. Because curcumin has shown improvements from current standards of care in other diseases with few true treatment options (e.g., osteoarthritis), there is immense potential for this compound in treating SCI. We critically and systematically summarize available data, discuss clinical implications, and propose further testing of this well-tolerated compound in both the preclinical and the clinical realms. Analyzing preclinical data from a clinical perspective, we hope to create awareness of the incredible potential that curcumin shows for SCI in a patient population that direly needs improvements on current therapy."

We have previously reported that sequential application of corticosterone and kainic acid (CORT + KA) mimicking the nerve injury condition results in synergistic enhancement of neurite outgrowth and expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG). GAP-43 is known to promote neurite extension when phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC). In addition PKC can phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) at Ser727, which is phosphorylated primarily by Janus kinase (JAK) at Tyr705. In this study, we further examine the role of PKC in this stress-induced growth-promoting effect. In the cultured DRG neurons, the JAK inhibitor AG-490 and the PKC inhibitor Ro-318220 reduced the CORT + KA-enhanced neurite growth effect when applied prior to CORT and KA treatment, respectively. Both AG-490 and Ro-318220 diminished the CORT + KA-enhanced GAP-43 expression, phosphorylation, and axonal localization. Furthermore, CORT + KA treatment synergistically phosphorylated STAT3 at Ser727 but not at Tyr705. Similar phenomena were observed in an animal model of acute spinal cord injury (SCI), in which phosphorylation of GAP-43 and phospho-Ser727-STAT3 was elevated in the injured DRG 4 hr after the impact injury. Further treatment with the therapeutic glucocorticoid methylprednisolone enhanced the phosphorylation of GAP-43 in both the DRG and the spinal cord of SCI rats. These results suggest that elevated glucocorticoids and overexcitation following CNS injury contribute to nerve regeneration via induction of JAK/PKC-mediated GAP-43 and STAT3 activities.

These events apparently include the activation of immune-derived cells and their products, as treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, limits the damage and thus improves recovery. On the other hand, immune-derived substances, such as cytokines, are thought to play an important role in post-traumatic axonal regeneration. Thus, the need to reduce inflammation to limit the spread of damage appears to be in conflict with the need to permit inflammation to promote regeneration. Comprehension and resolution of this apparent conflict may lead to the development of treatment protocols aimed at rescuing axons spared by the initial injury, without hampering the potential regeneration of directly and indirectly injured axons. In this study, carried out on rats with crushed optic nerves, daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone commencing prior to the injury significantly attenuated the injury-induced decrease in electrophysiological activity and reduced the area of tissue damage. On the other hand, dexamethasone treatment reduced the permissiveness of the injured nerves to neural adhesion and regrowth in vitro. This latter phenomenon was also observed in injured peripheral nerves. Results are discussed with respect to the possible establishment of an appropriate protocol for corticosteroid treatment of nerve injuries aimed at promoting neuronal rescue without compromising neuronal regeneration."

Identification of such 'secondary' injury factors has led to the development of various pharmacological strategies aimed at limiting this progressive tissue destruction. In this review, Alan Faden and Steven Salzman discuss the pharmacological approaches that have the most experimental support. These include corticosteroids, antioxidants and free-radical scavengers, modulators of arachidonate metabolism, gangliosides, monoamine modulators, opioid receptor antagonists, TRH and its analogs, NMDA receptor antagonists, Ca2+ channel antagonists and platelet-activating factor antagonists."

In patients treated with methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury, increased recovery of neurological function was seen at 6 weeks and at 6 months and continued to be observed 1 year after injury. For motor function, this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.030), and was found in patients with total sensory and motor loss in the emergency room (p = 0.019) and in those with some preservation of motor and sensory function (p = 0.024). Naloxone-treated patients did not show significantly greater recovery. Patients treated after 8 hours of injury recovered less motor function if receiving methylprednisolone (p = 0.08) or naloxone (p = 0.10) as compared with those given placebo. Complication and mortality rates were similar in either group of treated patients as compared with the placebo group. The authors conclude that treatment with the study dose of methylprednisolone is indicated for acute spinal cord trauma, but only if it can be started within 8 hours of injury."

To characterize static and dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) of individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) compared to able-bodied controls in response to moderate increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) caused by mild whole-body cold stress. Japan METHODS: Five men with complete autonomic cervical SCI (sustained > 5 y) and six age-matched able-bodied men participated in hemodynamic, temperature, catecholamine and respiratory measurements for 60 min during three consecutive stages: baseline (10 min; 33 °C water through a thin-tubed whole-body suit), mild cold stress (20 min; 25 °C water), and post-cold recovery (30 min; 33 °C water). Static CA was determined as the ratio between mean changes in middle cerebral artery blood velocity and MAP, dynamic CA as transfer function coherence, gain, and phase between spontaneous changes in MAP to middle cerebral artery blood velocity. MAP increased in both groups during cold and post-cold recovery (mean differences: 5-10 mm Hg; main effect of time: p = 0.001). Static CA was not different between the able-bodied vs. the cervical SCI group (mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) of between-group difference: -4 (-11 to 3) and -2 (-5 to 1) cm/s/mm Hg for cold (p = 0.22) and post-cold (p = 0.24), respectively). At baseline, transfer function phase was shorter in the cervical SCI group (mean (95% CI) of between-group difference: 0.6 (0.2 to 1.0) rad; p = 0.006), while between-group differences in changes in phase were not different in response to the cold stress (interaction term: p = 0.06). This pilot study suggests that static CA is similar between individuals with cervical SCI and able-bodied controls in response to moderate increases in MAP, while dynamic CA may be impaired in cervical SCI because of disturbed sympathetic control."

Neurophysiological and neuroprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A novel implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system enables targeted drug delivery and induction of temporary paraplegia in awake, behaving nonhuman primates. Three macaques displayed loss of voluntary leg movement for 60-90 min after injection of lidocaine with epinephrine, followed by a full recovery. This technique for the first time will enable ethical live recording from the proximal central nervous system during the acute onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia."

Our aim was to describe vasopressor usage and examine their effects in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 131 patients with SCI who received any kind of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure in the neurocritical care unit of a Level 1 trauma center (2005-2011). Vasopressor usage and complications were obtained from the medical record. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the American Spinal Injury Association score. Dopamine was the most commonly used vasopressor (48.0%), followed by phenylephrine (45.0%), norepinephrine (5.0%), epinephrine (1.5%), and vasopressin (0.5%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complications (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, troponin elevation, atrial fibrillation, heart rate >130 or <50, etc.) due to vasopressors were independently associated with the overall usages of dopamine (odds ratio [OR] 8.97; p<0.001) and phenylephrine (OR, 5.92; p=0.004), age ≥60 years old (OR, 5.16; p=0.013), and complete SCI (OR, 3.23; p=0.028). There was no difference in neurological improvement with either dopamine (OR, 1.16; p=0.788) or phenylephrine (OR 0.96; p=0.940). Incomplete SCI (OR, 2.64; p=0.019) and surgery <24 h after SCI (OR, 4.25; p=0.025) were independently associated with improved outcome. In summary, vasopressors are associated with increased complications in SCI patients. Further prospective studies are required in order to determine the potential benefits and risks of blood pressure management in patients with SCI."

Eleven SCI (spinal lesions between T6 and L1, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale A) and 14 able-bodied (AB) persons first rested for 1 h in a sitting position, before undergoing 2-h arm-crank ergometer exercise at 60% of maximum oxygen consumption followed by a 2-h recovery period. On another day, all subjects participated in a time control study (5 h of rest condition in sitting position). Urine and blood samples were collected hourly. There were no differences in mean blood pressure between the two groups. SCI patients showed attenuated increase in plasma adrenaline and increase in plasma aldosterone compared with AB controls, but similar changes in human atrial natriuretic polypeptide, plasma renin activity and plasma antidiuretic hormone following the exercise. Creatinine clearance, osmolal clearance, free water clearance and fractional excretion of Na(+) did not change during exercise in any of the subjects. These findings suggested that activated aldosterone and attenuated adrenaline responses during exercise in SCI could be due to adaptation to disordered sympathetic nervous system triggered to maintain renal function. The results showed no exercise-related adverse effects on renal function in hydrated subjects with SCI."

Experimental and control study. University laboratory, department of rehabilitation medicine, in Japan. Eight quadriplegic subjects with complete spinal cord transection at the C6 to C8 level and 6 age-matched healthy subjects. Cardiovascular and endocrine responses were examined during 2 minutes of control, 3 minutes of ice-water immersion of the foot, followed by a 3-minute recovery. Blood pressure, heart rate, the Borg 15-point Rating of Perceived Pain Scale, and blood samples for measurement of plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin. The rise in the mean arterial blood pressure during the cold pressor test in patients with SCI (baseline, 81.6+/-3.7mmHg; increased by 30%+/-6.1%) was significantly (P<.05) higher than that in healthy subjects (baseline, 101.2+/-4.5mmHg; increased by 20%+/-4.5%). The SCI subjects had no change in heart rate throughout the test, in contrast to the tachycardia noted in normal subjects. Baseline plasma norepinephrine in SCI subjects (63.0+/-18.3pg/mL) was significantly lower than in normal subjects (162.3+/-19.6pg/mL) and plasma norepinephrine increased significantly during the cold pressor test in both groups. In the SCI subjects, a reflex sympathetic discharge through the isolated spinal cord results in a more profound rise in mean blood pressure during ice-water immersion. This response was free of inhibitory impulses from supraspinal center and baroreceptor reflexes, either of which might restrain the increase in blood pressure."

To reduce allodynia, it would be desirable to implant a permanent biological pump such as adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (AM), which secrete catecholamines and opioid peptides, both antinociceptive substances, near the spinal cord. We tested this approach using a recently developed a mammalian SCI model of chronic central pain, which results in development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. Thirty day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally hemisected at T13 and allowed 4 weeks for recovery of locomotor function and development of allodynia. Nonimmunosuppressed injured animals received either control-striated muscle (n = 7) or AM (n = 10) transplants. Nociceptive behavior was tested for 4 weeks posttransplant as measured by paw withdrawals to von Frey filaments, radiant heat, and pin prick stimuli. Hemisected animals receiving AM demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both fore- and hindlimb mechanical and thermal allodynia, but not analgesia, when compared to hemisected animals receiving striated muscle transplants (P < 0.05). Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity indicated prolonged transplant survival and production of catecholamines. HPLC analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples from animals receiving AM transplants demonstrated statistically significant increases in levels of dopamine (sevenfold), norepinephrine (twofold), and epinephrine (threefold), compared to control values several weeks following transplant (P < 0.05). By 28 days posttransplant, however, antinociceptive effects were diminished. These results support the therapeutic potential of transplanted AM in reducing chronic central pain following spinal cord injury."

Morphometric axonal analyses were also done. Incomplete spinal compression was induced in albino New Zealand rabbits anesthetized with ketamine. Neurological deficit was assessed by Tarlov's scale. The animals were divided into different groups. In one group the animals were anesthetized and subjected to all procedures except spinal cord injury and pharmacological treatment. Each of the other groups were divided into 2 subgroups; the spinal cord compression was induced for 2 min in one subgroup and 5 min in other subgroup. The pharmacological treatment in different groups consisted of slow intravenous infusions of saline alone, combination of adrenaline and nimodipine, nimodipine alone and adrenaline alone. The evolution of the motor damage was evaluated by comparing scores obtained with Tarlov's scale 1, 24 and 48 hrs after the end of spinal cord compression. In all animals, spinal cord compression for 2 and 5 min induced a 5th degree motor deficit. Treatment with saline improved slightly the motor deficit. The improvement of motor deficit was much better when a combination of nimodipine and adrenaline was used. The animals treated with nimodipine alone showed a better recovery in comparison with the animals treated with saline alone."

Environmental stimulation produces changes including expansion of visual cortex, increases in dendritic branching, glia and cholinesterase. Environmental stimulation also produces behavioural changes. Experimental electrical stimulation produces changes in synapse size, synaptic vesicle change, dendritic branching and changes in synaptic transmission. In man, repetitive electrical stimulation via epidural electrodes increases plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, and CSF levels of norepinephrine. Repetitive electrical stimulation in man dates back to 1967 and has been used for the control of pain, to improve spasticity, bladder control, motor deficit and the autonomic hyperreflexia of spinal cord injury. In addition, improvement has been reported in epilepsy, cerebral palsy, torticollis and peripheral vascular diseases. The best controlled studies are in multiple sclerosis and peripheral vascular disease, and these results will be presented in more detail."

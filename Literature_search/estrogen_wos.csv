In order to gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of 17 beta-estradiol, the following endpoints of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) motor recovery score. In order to elucidate whether the protective effects of 17 beta-estradiol were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of 17 beta-estradiol. ICI 182,780 (500 4g/kg administered subcutaneously 1 h prior to treatment with 17 beta-estradiol) significantly antagonized the effect of the 17 beta-estradiol and abolished the protective effect against SCI."

MARCKS supports development, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration after injury. MARCKS binds with its functionally essential effector domain (ED) to polysialic acid. A 25-mer peptide comprising the ED of MARCKS stimulates neuritogenesis of primary hippocampal neurons after addition to the culture. This motivated us to investigate whether ED peptide has similar effects in spinal cord injury. ED peptide supported recovery and regrowth of monoaminergic axons in female, but not in male mice. Sex-specific differences in response to ED peptide application also occurred in cultured neurons. In female but not male neurons, the ED peptide enhanced neurite outgrowth that could be suppressed by inhibitors of the estrogen receptors alpha and beta, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, protein kinase C, and matrix metalloproteinase 2. In addition, we observed female-specific elevation of phosphorylated MARCKS levels after ED peptide treatment. In male neurons, the ED peptide enhanced neuritogenesis in the presence of an androgen receptor inhibitor to the extent seen in ED peptide-treated female neurons. However, inhibition of androgen receptor did not lead to increased phosphorylation of MARCKS. These results provide insights into the functions of a novel compound contributing to gender-dependent regeneration."

Patients with SCI usually exhibit severe clinical symptoms, including sensory and motor dysfunction below the injured levels, paraplegia, quadriplegia and urinary retention, which can exacerbate the substantial medical and social burdens. The major pathological change observed in SCI is inflammatory reaction, which induces demyelination, axonal degeneration, and the apoptosis and necrosis of neurons. Traditional medical treatments are mainly focused on the recovery of motor function and prevention of complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of SCI and have proposed lots of effective treatments, but the clinical applications are still limited due to the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis after SCI. Endocrine hormones are kinds of molecules that are synthesized by specialized endocrine organs and can participate in the regulation of multiple physiological activities, and their protective effects on several disorders have been widely discussed. In addition, many studies have identified that endocrine hormones can promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery in individuals with central nervous system diseases. Therefore, studies investigating the clinical applications of endocrine hormones as treatments for SCI are necessary. In this review, we described the neuroprotective roles of several endocrine hormones in SCI; endocrine hormone administration reduces cell death and promotes functional repair after SCI. We also proposed novel therapies for SCI."

The SCI model was established with male rats and the rats were randomly divided into E2-treated group (SCI + E2) and E2-untreated group (SCI). Sham group was also used as control (Sham). The angiogenesis after SCI was monitored by F-18-alfatide II PET/CT and verified by immunofluorescence of CD31 and CD61. We also evaluated the level of E2 and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were determined to evaluate the exercise capacity of the rats in all 3 groups. Our results showed that the BBB score of SCI + E2 group was significantly different from that of SCI group (P < .05) and Sham group (P < .01). The uptake of F-18-alfatide II was positively correlated with the expression level of GAP43, both of which reached the peak at day 7 after injury. CD31 and CD61 immunostaining further verified increased angiogenesis in E2-treated SCI lesions. We concluded that F-18-alfatide II PET/CT can monitor the angiogenesis status after SCI in vivo and it may help clinician predict the progression of patients with SCI. This may benefit the study of vascular repair after SCI and provide a tool for evaluation of SCI treatment in clinical practices."

In these mouse models, Cre-recombination is not induced until tamoxifen is administered, which allows researchers to have temporal control of genetic modifications. Interestingly, tamoxifen has been identified as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury patients due to its neuroprotective properties. It is also reparative in that it stimulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, it is unknown whether tamoxifen is neuroprotective and neuroreparative when administration is delayed after SCI. To properly interpret data from transgenic mice in which tamoxifen treatment is delayed after SCI, it is necessary to identify the effects of tamoxifen alone on anatomical and functional recovery. In this study, female and male mice received a moderate mid-thoracic spinal cord contusion. Mice were then gavaged with corn oil or a high dose of tamoxifen from 19-22 days post-injury, and sacrificed 42 days post-injury. All mice underwent behavioral testing for the duration of the study, which revealed that tamoxifen treatment did not impact hindlimb motor recovery. Similarly, histological analyses revealed that tamoxifen had no effect on white matter sparing, total axon number, axon sprouting, glial reactivity, cell proliferation, oligodendrocyte number, or myelination, but tamoxifen did decrease the number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horn. Semi-thin sections confirmed that axon demyelination and remyelination were unaffected by tamoxifen. Sex-specific responses to tamoxifen were also assessed, and there were no significant differences between female and male mice. These data suggest that delayed tamoxifen administration after SCI does not change functional recovery or improve tissue sparing in female or male mice."

Method Subcortical axonal fiber injury model was used in this study. Morris water maze was conducted to detect the learning and memory ability of the rats; modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and beam walking test were performed to evaluate the behavioral; and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used for the determination of recovery after subcortical axonal injury, while Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of p-Akt, CDK5, p-Ser262, p-Ser404, and p-Thr205. Results Compared with the Sham group, the injury of subcortical axonal fiber resulted in higher mNSS, higher beam walking scores, longer time of escape latency, less number, time and shorter distance of crossing the quadrant, and less FA values. After ovariectomy, the mNSS, beam walking scores, and escape latency reached the peak; inversely, the others reached a minimum. High estrogen treatment reduced the mNSS, beam walking score, and escape latency; improved the number, time, and distance of crossing the quadrant; and increased the FA value. Western blotting results showed that estrogen increased the expression of p-Akt and decreased the expression of CDK5, p-Ser262, p-Ser404, and p-Thr205. All the changes were counteracted to some extent by Akt inhibitor LY294002. Conclusion After subcortical axonal injury, estrogen could improve the regeneration of axons and improve their functions via regulating the PI3K/Akt/CDK5/Tau pathway."

The ensuing reactive gliosis, inflammatory cascade, and glial scar formation impede axonal regrowth. Although systemic anti-inflammatory agents (steroids) have been previously administered to counteract this, no current therapeutic is approved for post-injury neuronal regeneration, in part because of related side effects. Likewise, therapeutic systemic estrogen levels exhibit neuroprotective properties, but dose-dependent side effects are prohibitive. The current study thus uses low-dose estrogen delivery to the spinal cord injury (SCI) site using an agarose gel patch embedded with estrogen-loaded nanoparticles. Compared to controls, spinal cords from rodents treated with nanoparticle site-directed estrogen demonstrated significantly decreased post-injury lesion size, reactive gliosis, and glial scar formation. However, axonal regeneration, vascular endothelial growth factor production, and glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor levels were increased with estrogen administration. Concomitantly improved locomotor and bladder functional recovery were observed with estrogen administration after injury. Therefore, low-dose site-directed estrogen may provide a future approach for enhanced neuronal repair and functional recovery in SCI patients."

This could be due to the enormous innervation of the spinocerebellar tract from the posterior gray horn in the spinal cord to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Although the neuroprotective role of estradiol in spinal cord (SC) injuries, as well as its ability to delay secondary cell death changes, is well-known, its effect on cerebellar layers is not fully investigated. In this study, a SCI model was achieved by injection of Kainic acid into SC of adult Male Wistar rats in order to assess the effects of SCI on the cerebellum. The animals were classified into SCI group (animals with SCI), estradiol-treated group (animals with SCI and received estradiol), control groups, and sham control group. The microscopical examination 24h after induction of SCI revealed that KA induced the most characteristics of neurodegeneration including astrocytic propagation and microglial activation. The estradiol was injected intraperitoneally 20min after induction of SCI, and the samples were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30days. Histologically, the estradiol reduced the inflammatory response, enhanced the recovery of molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell layers, and therefore aided in the restoration of layer organization. These findings were also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and gene expression profiling."

The aim of this study was to generate a candidate cell line from late-adherent hOMCs, thought to contain the OEC subset. Primary late-adherent hOMCs were transduced with a c-MycER(TAM) gene that enables cell proliferation in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Two c-MycER(TAM)-derived polyclonal populations, PA5 and PA7, were generated and expanded. PA5 cells had a normal human karyotype (46, XY) and exhibited faster growth kinetics than PA7, and were therefore selected for further characterisation. PA5 hOMCs express glial markers (p75(NTR)', S100 beta, GFAP and oligodendrocyte marker O4), neuronal markers (nestin and beta-III-tu bulin) and fibroblast-associated markers (CD90/Thy1 and fibronectin). Co-culture of PA5 cells with a neuronal cell line (NG108-15) and with primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons resulted in significant neurite outgrowth after 5 days. Therefore, c-MycER(TAM)-derived PA5 hOMCs have potential as a regenerative therapy for neural cells."

Totally 72 adult rats were divided into a simple injury group and an estrogen group. Then several animal models with SCI were prepared. The estrogen group was treated with intramuscular injection of 100 mu g/kg estrogen every day till the death of animal models, while the simple injury group was treated with intramuscular injection of 0.5mL saline every day. Then these animals were put to death in the 1st d, 3rd d, 5th d, 8th d, 14th d and 21st d after SCI respectively and tissue sections were prepared, followed by B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) detection, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and detection of the cell apoptosis in animal models after SCI. In the 14th d after the injury of spinal cord nervous system, Gale grading and inclined plate maintenance tests were carried out. In the 1st d after SCI, there was a higher expression of Bcl-2 protein in the SCI tissues. Bcl-2 protein reached the peak in the 3rd d after SCI in the simple injured group, while the estrogen group reached the peak in the 8th d. At that time, Bcl-2 protein was both expressed in nerve cells, and in glial cells in a higher level. The expression began to decline in the 14th d after SCI, and with only a little expression in the 21st d after SCI (p<0.05). TUNEL detection results showed that, positive cells dominated by glial cells emerged in simple injured group only 24th h later; they reached the peak after 3 similar to 8 days, and then began to reduce. In the 21st d, positive cells still existed, and there was less cell apoptosis after treated with estrogen (p<0.05). Two weeks after SCI, Gale score and inclined plate maintenance rate were higher in the estrogen group than in the simple injured group (p<0.01). Adverse effects that occurred in injury group included blood dryness, necrosis, cyst cavity and cavity, while in estrogen group, adverse effects included focal bleeding, hydropic degeneration of neuron, disappearance of partial nissl bodies and neuraxial edema. All these findings suggest that, estrogen used for treating SCI can effectively inhibit the apoptosis of early nerve cells and glial cells in injured spinal cord nervous system by improving the micro-circulation, enhancing the expression of Bcl-2 protein, removing the free radicals and inhibiting the antioxidation. Thus, it can reduce the secondary SCI and promote the recovery of injured spinal cord nervous functions."

We discuss the unique caveats this creates to the translatability of preclinical research in the SCI field. We also review current clinical and preclinical data examining sex as biological variable in SCI. Further, we report how technical considerations such as housing, size, care management, and age, confound the interpretation of sex-specific effects in animal studies of SCI.

Successful neuroregeneration is a method for the potential treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. A nonsteroidal estrogen receptor modulator, Tamoxifen, is an effective inhibitor of cell-swelling-activated anion channels and can mimic neuroprotective effects of estrogen in experimental ischemic stroke. However, its remains unclear whether Tamoxifen has beneficial effects in the pathological process after WMLs. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of Tamoxifen on multiple elements of oligovascular niche of the male C57BL/6 mice brain after bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) - induced WMLs. Tamoxifen was injected intraperitoneally once daily from 1 day after BCAS until 1 day before sacrificed. Following chronic hypoperfusion, BCAS mice presented white matter demyelination, loss of axon-glia integrity, activated inflammatory response, and cognitive impairments. Tamoxifen treatment significantly facilitated functional restoration of working memory impairment in mice after white matter injury, thus indicating a translational potential for this estrogen receptor modulator given its clinical safety and applicability for WMLs, which lack of currently available treatments. Furthermore, Tamoxifen treatment reduced microglia activation and inflammatory response, favored microglial polarization toward to the M2 phenotype, enhanced oligodendrocyte precursor cells proliferation and differentiation, and promoted remyelination after chronic hypoperfusion. Together, our data indicate that Tamoxifen could alleviate white matter injury and play multiple targets protective effects following chronic hypoperfusion, which is a promising candidate for the therapeutic target for ischemic WMIs and other demyelination diseases associated cognitive impairment."

Immediate treatment with diarylpropionitrile (DPN), a non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor beta ligand, resulted in a significant increase in Nrf2 levels, and reduction of inflammation and apoptosis compared to untreated SCI animals.

The present study compared histologic and functional outcomes between age-matched male and female Sprague-Dawley rats in a moderate thoracic contusion SCI model. Cresyl violet and eosin staining showed no significant differences in lesion volume between genders after 9 weeks post-SCI (p > 0.05). Luxol fast blue-stained spared myelin was similar between genders, although slightly greater (similar to 6%) in spared myelin, compared with cord volume (p = 0.044). Glial reactivity and macrophage labeling in the lesion area was comparable between genders, as well. Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) functional scores were not significantly different between genders, and Hargreaves thermal hyperalgesia and Gridwalk sensorimotor analyses also were similar between genders, compared with uninjured gender controls. Analysis of covariance showed weight did not influence functional recovery as assessed through BBB (p = 0.65) or Gridwalk assessment (p = 0.63) in this study. In conclusion, our findings suggest age-matched male and female rats recover similarly in a common clinically relevant SCI model."

Here, we hypothesized that SCI in rats would disrupt circadian regulation of key metabolic organs, leading to metabolic dysregulation. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats received moderate thoracic (T)-9 contusion SCI (or sham surgery). First, SCI disrupted diurnal rhythms in two metabolic behaviors: fecal production and food intake rhythms were ablated acutely. SCI also expedited whole-gut transit time. In parallel, acute SCI increased plasma glucose. Diurnal glucose storage-release cycles regulated by the liver were disrupted by SCI, which also increased liver glucose metabolism messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Further, SCI disrupted liver clock gene expression and suppressed inflammatory gene rhythms. Together, our novel data suggest that SCI disrupts typical metabolic and circadian function. Improving post-SCI metabolic function could enhance recovery of homeostasis."

TAM reduced reactive gliosis during chronic stages and increased the expression of Olig-2. A significant difference was observed in estrogen receptor alpha between male and female rodents from 2 to 28 DPI suggesting a sexually dimorphic characteristic that could be related to the behavioral differences observed in the therapeutic window of TAM.

Moreover, E2 and SC significantly decreased the number of Iba-1+ (microglia) and GFAP(+) cells (astrocyte) in the SCI group. In addition, we found a significant reduction of mitochondrial fission-markers (Fis1) and an increase of fusion-markers (Mfn1 and Mfn2) in the injured spinal cord after E2 and SC treatment.

In this study, the penetrating injury was provoked by a sharp projectile that penetrates through right dorsal and ventral portions of the T13-L1 spinal segments, affecting propriospinal and descending/ascending tracts. Intraperitoneal application of Tamoxifen and a treadmill exercise protocol, as rehabilitation therapies, separately or combined, were used. To evaluate the functional recovery, angular patterns of the hip, knee and ankle joints as well as the leg pendulum-like movement (PLM) were measured during the unrestricted gait of treated and untreated (UT) animals, previously and after the traumatic injury (15 and 30 days post-injury (dpi)). A pattern (curve) comparison analysis was made by using a locally designed Matlab script that determines the Frechet dissimilarity. The SCI magnitude was assessed by qualitative and quantitative histological analysis of the injury site 30 days after SCI. Our results showed that all treated groups had an improvement in hindlimbs kinematics compared to the UT group, which showed a poor gait locomotion recovery throughout the rehabilitation period. The group with the combined treatment (tamoxifen+exercise (TE)) presented the best outcome.

Additionally, for studies supporting the notion of a female gender related advantage, a definite cause has not been explained. In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance. age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male.

In the present study, we investigated the role of a newly found membrane ER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPR30 or GPER1), and discussed the feasibility of a GPR30 agonist as an estrogen replacement. Forty adult female C57BL/6J mice (10-12 weeks old) were divided randomly into vehicle, G-1, E2, G-1 + G-15 and E2 + G-15 groups. All mice were subjected to SCI using a crushing injury approach. The specific GPR30 agonist, G-1, mimicked the effects of E2 treatment by preventing SCI-induced apoptotic cell death and enhancing motor functional recovery after injury. GPR30 activation regulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways, increased GPR30 and anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but decreased the pro-apoptosis factor Bax and cleaved caspase-3. However, the neuroprotective effects of G-1 and E2 were blocked by the specific GPR30 antagonist, G-15. Thus, GPR30 rather than classic ERs is required to induce estrogenic neuroprotective effects. Given that estrogen replacement therapy may cause unexpected side effects, especially on the reproductive system, GPR30 agonists may represent a potential therapeutic approach for treating SCI."

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone."

Cholera toxin B (CTB) labeling from the sciatic nerve of naive rats revealed effective labeling of the terminal fibers in the gracile nucleus at 3 days post-injection and a subpopulation of rapidly transporting fibers after 1 day. Seven days after contusions using the Infinite Horizon impactor the area of CTB-labeled terminal fibers had a negative correlation with increasing impact force. Moderate spinal contusions of around 150 kilodyne (kdyn or 0.15 x 10(-3) newton) caused a reduction to 40% in the fiber area which will enable the identification of protective as well as detrimental drugs and post-injury mechanisms. A preconditioning injury of the sciatic nerve reportedly can enhance growth of sensory axons but did not affect the terminal fiber area in the gracile nucleus. Estrogen and progesterone are protective in various systems and could therefore influence experimental outcomes when using females. However, the phase of the estrus cycle at the time of contusion or during the post-injury time did not affect the outcome of the contusion, indicating that female rats may be used without consideration of the estrus cycle.

Additionally, E2 also enhanced the secretion of growth factors by hEASCs, thereby making the local microenvironment more conducive for tissue regeneration. Overall, E2 administration enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hEASCs transplantation and facilitated motor function recovery after SCI. Hence, E2 administration may be an intervention of choice for enhancing survival of transplanted hEASCs after SCI."

Safety concerns around the use of high doses of E2 have limited clinical application, however. To address these concerns, low doses of E2 (25 mu g and 2.5 mu g) were focally delivered to the injured spinal cord using nanoparticles. A per-acute model (6 h after injury) was used to assess nanoparticle release of E2 into damaged spinal cord tissue; in addition, E2 was evaluated as a rapid anti-inflammatory. To assess inflammation, 27-plex cytokine/chemokine arrays were conducted in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal cord tissue. A particular focus was placed on IL-6, GRO-KC, and MCP-1 as these have been identified from CSF in human studies as potential biomarkers in SCI. S100 beta, an additional proposed biomarker, was also assessed in spinal cord tissue only. Tissue concentrations of E2 were double those found in the plasma, indicating focal release. E2 showed rapid anti-inflammatory effects, significantly reducing interleukin (IL)-6, GRO-KC, MCP-1, and S100 beta in one or all compartments. Numerous additional targets of rapid E2 modulation were identified including: leptin, MIP-1 alpha, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, IFN gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, etc. These data further elucidate the rapid anti-inflammatory effects E2 exerts in an acute rat SCI model, have identified additional targets of estrogen efficacy, and suggest nanoparticle delivered estrogen may provide a safe and efficacious treatment option in persons with acute SCI."

The physical trauma to the spinal cord initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generates a non-permissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment. In addition, the effects of Tamoxifen in axonal outgrowth or synapse formation needs to be investigated. This review will address some of the mechanisms activated by Tamoxifen after SCI and the results recently published by investigators in the field."

The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100g/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI.

In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females.

After a moderate contusion injury at the 9th thoracic segment of spinal cord, E2 (300 mu g/kg) was administered by iv injection immediately after SCI, and the same dose of E2 was then administered 6 and 24 hours after injury. Our data show that E2 attenuated BSCB permeability and hemorrhage and reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and macorphages after SCI. Consistent with this finding, the expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly reduced by E2. Furthermore, E2 treatment significantly inhibited the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential melastatin 4 after injury, which are known to mediate hemorrhage at an early stage after SCI. Moreover, the expression and activation of matrix metalloprotease-9 after injury, which is known to disrupt BSCB, and the degradation of tight junction proteins, such as zona occludens-1 and occludin, were significantly inhibited by E2 treatment. Furthermore, the protective effects of E2 on BSCB disruption and functional improvement were abolished by an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182780 (3 mg/kg).

Rats received a hemicontusion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra (C5) followed by administration of 17 beta-estradiol via a slow release pellet (0.5 or 5.0 mg/pellet) beginning at 30 minutes post-SCI. Behavioral evaluation of skilled and unskilled forelimb function and locomotor function were conducted for 7 weeks after SCI. Upon conclusion of the behavioral assessments, spinal cords were collected and histochemistry and stereology were conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on the lesion characteristics. We found that post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol decreased neuronal loss in the ventral horn, decreased reactive astrogliosis, decreased the immune response, and increased white mater sparing at the lesion epicenter. Additionally, post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol improved skilled forelimb function and locomotor function. Taken together, these data suggest that post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol protected both the gray and white matter in cervical SCI.

Unfortunately, we still do not have suitable therapeutic agents for treatment of SCI and prevention of its devastating consequences. However, we have gained a good understanding of pathological mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration leading to paralysis or even death following SCI. Primary injury to the spinal cord initiates the secondary injury process that includes various deleterious factors for ultimate activation of different cysteine proteases for degradation of cellular key cytoskeleton and other crucial proteins for delayed death of neurons and glial cells at the site of SCI and its penumbra in different animal models. An important aspect of SCI is the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration within a short time of primary injury. Various studies in different laboratories demonstrate that the most important cysteine protease for neurodegeneration in SCI is calpain, which absolutely requires intracellular free Ca2+ for its activation. Furthermore, other cysteine proteases, such as caspases and cathepsin B also make a contribution to neurodegeneration in SCI. Therefore, inhibition of cysteine proteases is an important goal in prevention of neurodegeneration in SCI. Studies showed that individual inhibitors of cysteine proteases provided significant neuroprotection in animal models of SCI. Recent studies suggest that physiological hormones, such as estrogen and melatonin, can be successfully used for prevention of neurodegeneration and preservation of motor function in acute SCI as well as in chronic SCI in rats."

These experiments test the hypothesis that endogenous testosterone in male rats alters 17 beta-estradiol-mediated protection by evaluating a delayed administration over a clinically relevant dose range and manipulating testicular-derived testosterone. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were either gonadectomized or left gonad-intact prior to SCI. SCI was produced by a midthoracic crush injury.

Furthermore, administration of Rho inhibitor, PEP-1-C3 exoenzyme, inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, and decreased phosphorylated c-Jun level at 5 d after injury. Additionally, the attenuation of RhoA and JNK3 activation as well as oligodendrocyte cell death by 17 beta-estradiol was reversed by ER antagonist, ICI182780. Our results thus indicate that 17 beta-estradiol treatment improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing oligodendrocyte cell death via inhibition of RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were ER dependent. Furthermore, improvement of hindlimb motor function by posttreatment of 17 beta-estradiol suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI patients. (Endocrinology 153: 3815-3827, 2012)"

The inflammatory response initiated by spinal cord injury (SCI) involves the processing of interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and IL-18 mediated by caspase-1 which is under the control of an intracellular multiprotein complex called inflammasome. We recently described in a SCI model that between 24 and 72 h post-injury, most of inflammasome components including IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 are upregulated. In this study, we investigated the influence of E2 treatment after spinal cord contusion on inflammasome regulation. After contusion of T9 spinal segment, 12-week-old male Wistar rats were treated subcutaneously with E2 immediately after injury and every 12 h for the next 3 days. Behavioral scores were significantly improved in E2-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated groups. Functional improvement in E2-treated animals was paralleled by the attenuated expression of certain inflammasome components such as ASC, NLRP1b, and NLRP3 together with IL1b, IL-18, and caspase-1. On the histopathological level, microgliosis and oligodendrocyte injury was ameliorated. These findings support and extend the knowledge of the E2-mediated neuroprotective function during SCI. The control of the inflammasome machinery by E2 might be a missing piece of the puzzle to understand the anti-inflammatory potency of E2."

Spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy. To gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of E2, the following end points of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) expression of NOS, nitrotyrosine, and COX-2; (4) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression); and (5) tissue TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels. In another set of experiments, the pretreatment or posttreatment with E2 significantly ameliorates the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of E2 were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of E2. ICI 182,780 (500 mu g/kg, s.c., 1 h before treatment with E2) significantly antagonized the effect of the E2 and abolished the protective effect against SCI.

Furthermore, our ongoing studies designed to explore the different translational potential of estrogen therapy suggest that this multiactive steroid may act as an adjunct therapy to promote angiogenesis, thus enhancing the functional recovery following chronic SCI.

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-a) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-a mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-a antagonist. We also observed that ER-a was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-a. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-a dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen's effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This sexual dimorphism is wiped out and recovery is worse in adult mice deprived of mature T cells. After spinal cord contusion in adult rats, functional recovery ( measured by locomotor scores in an open field) was significantly worse in females treated with dihydrotestosterone prior to the injury than in placebo-treated controls, and significantly better in castrated males than in their noncastrated male littermates. Post-traumatic administration of the testosterone receptor antagonist flutamide promoted the functional recovery in adult male rats. These results, in line with the known inhibitory effect of testosterone on cell-mediated immunity, suggest that androgen-mediated immunosuppression plays a role in ISCI-related immune dysfunction and can therefore partly explain the worse outcome of ISCI in males than in female. We suggest that females, which are more prone to develop autoimmune response than males, benefit from this response in cases of CNS insults."

Similarly, numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone administration is associated with a mortality reduction, improvement in neurological outcomes, and a reduction in neuronal apoptosis after TBI and SCI.

Estrogen and progesterone-mediated neuroprotection are thought to be related to their effects on hormone receptors, signaling systems, direct antioxidant effects, effects on astrocytes and microglia, modulation of the inflammatory response, effects on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and effects on mediating glutamate excitotoxicity.

Release of cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6) was assessed 6 h, 3 days and 1 week post-injury. Reactive astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP and vimentin, and diffusion of CID68-positive inflammatory cells were examined from 3 days to 4 weeks following SCI. Treatment with 17 beta-estradiol significantly increased locomotor function from the first week until 4 weeks post-SCI. The injured spinal cord of 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats expressed more IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 than controls 6 h after injury. Moreover, 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats showed reactive astrocytes as soon as 3 days following SCI, with increased GFAP expression, smaller lesion areas and more limited diffusion of CD68-positive cells after 1 week post-injury compared to controls. The number of CD68-positive cells was also reduced in 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats one week post-SCI. However, these differences between 17 beta-estradiol-treated and control rats disappeared after 4 weeks. These results suggest that 17 beta-estradiol protects the spinal cord by stimulating early cytokines release and astroglial responses. These stimulations may prevent the area of damage from expanding and inflammatory cells to spread in the surrounding tissue during the critical first week following SCI. Although transient, these effects improved the locomotor recovery that was sustained over 4 weeks after injury. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We determined the role of CCL2 in astrocytes in vivo during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by using Cre-loxP gene deletion. Mice with a conditional gene deletion of CCL2 from astrocytes had less severe EAE late in disease while having a similar incidence and severity of disease at onset as compared to wild type (WT) control littermates. EAE mice devoid of CCL2 in astrocytes had less macrophage and T cell inflammation in the white matter of the spinal cord and less diffuse activation of astrocytes and microglia in both white and gray matter as well as less axonal loss and demyelination, compared to WT littermates. These findings demonstrate that CCL2 in astrocytes plays an important role in the continued recruitment of immune cells and activation of glial cells in the CNS during chronic EAE, thereby suggesting a novel cell specific target for neuroprotective treatments of chronic neuroinflammatory diseases.

Administration of 17 beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats improved recovery of hind-limb locomotion, increased white matter sparing, and decreased apoptosis in both the post- and pre-menopausal rats. Also, ovary-intact I-year-old rats did worse than ovary-intact 2-month-old rats, suggesting that endogenous estrogen confers neuroprotection in young rats, which is lost in older animals.

Many of these are administered as soon as possible after injury with the hope of attenuating secondary damage and maximizing the extent of spared neurologic tissue. In this article, we systematically review the available pre-clinical research on such neuroprotective therapies that are administered in a non-invasive manner for acute SCI. Specifically, we review treatments that have a relatively high potential for translation due to the fact that they are already used in human clinical applications, or are available in a form that could be administered to humans. These include: erythropoietin, NSAIDs, anti-CD11d antibodies, minocycline, progesterone, estrogen, magnesium, riluzole, polyethylene glycol, atorvastatin, inosine, and pioglitazone. The literature was systematically reviewed to examine studies in which an in-vivo animal model was utilized to assess the efficacy of the therapy in a traumatic SCI paradigm. Using these criteria, 122 studies were identified and reviewed in detail. Wide variations exist in the animal species, injury models, and experimental designs reported in the pre-clinical literature on the therapies reviewed. The review highlights the extent of investigation that has occurred in these specific therapies, and points out gaps in our knowledge that would be potentially valuable prior to human translation."

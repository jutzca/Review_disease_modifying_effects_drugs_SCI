While the development of novel compounds or cell-based interventions for spinal cord injury is unquestionably worthwhile, a complementary approach examines current standards of care and the degree to which these can be optimized to benefit long-term neurological function. Numerous classes of drugs, already in use in the acute phase of spinal cord injury, are intriguing because they (1) readily cross the blood-spinal cord barrier to modulate activity in the central nervous system and (2) are administered during a window of time in which neuroprotection, and even some repair, are feasible. Here, we review a rare case of convergent lines of evidence from both preclinical and human studies to support the early administration of a class of drug (ie, gabapentinoids) to both foster motor recovery and reduce the severity of neuropathic pain."

Some of these SCI-related conditions can be accommodated with compensatory strategies. Perhaps no SCI-associated condition is more troublesome and recalcitrant to the treating physiatrist than chronic neuropathic pain. In addition to the expected challenges in treating any chronic pain condition, treatment of SCI-related pain has the added difficulty of disruption of normal neural pathways that subserve pain transmission and attenuation. This article reviews selected treatment strategies for SCI-associated neuropathic pain."

Methods Spinal epidural electrodes were implanted in rats at T12 rostral to a quadrant dorsal horn injury at T13. Further groups additionally received either a microlesion to the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) or gabapentin (10 mg/kg). SCS was performed at 25 Hz for 10 minutes on day 4 (early SCS) and at 10 Hz for 10 minutes on day 8 (late SCS) after injury. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was measured before injury, 30 minutes before or after SCS, and before cull on day 14, followed by immunostaining assessment. Results Paw withdrawal thresholds in uninjured animals (51.0 +/- 4.0 g) were markedly reduced after SCI (17.3 +/- 2.2 g). This was significantly increased by early SCS (38.5 +/- 5.2 g,P < 0.01) and further enhanced by late SCS (50.9 +/- 1.9 g,P < 0.01) over 6 days. Numbers of neural progenitors expressing nestin, Sox2, and doublecortin (DCX) in the spinal dorsal horn were increased 6 days after SCS by 6-fold, 2-fold, and 2.5-fold, respectively (P < 0.05 to 0.01). The elevated PWT evoked by SCS was abolished by DLF microlesions (48.9 +/- 2.6 g vs. 19.0 +/- 3.9 g,P < 0.01) and the number of nestin-positive cells was reduced to the level without SCS (P < 0.05). Gabapentin enhanced late SCS-induced analgesia from 37.0 +/- 3.9 g to 54.0 +/- 0.8 g (P < 0.01) and increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neuronal marker vesicular GABA transporter-positive newborn cells 2-fold (P < 0.01). Conclusions Spinal progenitor cells appear to be activated by SCS via descending pathways, which may be enhanced by gabapentin and potentially contributes to relief of SCI-induced neuropathic pain."

Here, we found that the alpha 2 delta 2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels negatively regulates axon growth and regeneration of corticospinal neurons, the cells that originate the corticospinal tract. Increased alpha 2 delta 2 expression in corticospinal neurons contributed to loss of corticospinal regrowth ability during postnatal development and after SCI. In contrast, alpha 2 delta 2 pharmacological blockade through gabapentin administration promoted corticospinal structural plasticity and regeneration in adulthood. Using an optogenetic strategy combined with in vivo electrophysiological recording, we demonstrated that regenerating corticospinal axons functionally integrate into spinal circuits. Mice administered gabapentin recovered upper extremity function after cervical SCI. Importantly, such recovery relies on reorganization of the corticospinal pathway, as chemogenetic silencing of injured corticospinal neurons transiently abrogated recovery. Thus, targeting alpha 2 delta 2 with a clinically relevant treatment strategy aids repair of motor circuits after SCI."

Identification of specific molecular pathways that are involved in pain syndromes has become a major priority in current SCI research. We have investigated the role of a cation-dependent chloride transporter, Cl-regulatory protein Na+K+- Cl-1 (NKCC1), phosphorylation profile of NKCC1 and its specific involvement in neuropathic pain following contusion SCI (cSCI) using a rat model. Administration of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (BU) increases the mean hindpaw withdrawal latency time (WLT), thermal hyperalgesia (TH) following cSCI. These results demonstrate implication of NKCC1 co-transporter and BUin SCI-induced neuropathic pain. The with-no-lysine (K)-1 (WNK1) kinase has been shown to be an important regulator of NKCC1 phosphorylation in many systems, including nocioception. Mutations in a neuronal-specific exon of WNK1 (HSN2) was identified in patients that have hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSANII) also implicates WNK1 in nocioception, such that these patients have loss of perception to pain, touch and heat. In our ongoing research we proposed two studies utilizing our contusion SCI (cSCI) NP model of rat. Purpose: Study 1 aimed at NKCC1 expression and activity is up-regulated following cSCI in the early edema and chronic neuropathic pain phases. Study 2 aimed at identifying the expression profile of alternatively spliced WNK1 isoforms in animals exhibiting thermal hyperalgesia (TH) following cSCI. Methods: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (275-300 g) following laminectomy received cSCI at T9 with the NYU impactor-device II by dropping 10 g weight from the height of 12.5 mm. Control rats obtained laminectomy but no impaction. Following injury, functional recovery was assessed by BBB locomotor scores on day 1, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 42 and development of thermal hyperalgesia on day 21, 28, 35, and 42 day of injury by monitoring hind paw withdraw latency time (WLT) in seconds compared with the baseline data before injury. Results: Increased NKCC1 may explain observed increase in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2, exhibiting NKCC1 localization in neurons. This data supports NKCC1' s role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic phases of injury, namely spinal cord edema and chronic phase neuropathic pain. NKCC1 dependent chloride influx requires the phosphorylation at specific residues. Probing for the HSN2 exon of WNK1 reveals two key findings: i) the HSN2 exon is found in alternatively spliced neuronal isoforms found at 250 kDa and 230 kDa; ii) the 250 kDa isoform is found only in tissue that is injured. Conclusions: This data implicates the NKCC1/WNK1/WNK1HSN2 involvement in post-injury response that contributes to the development of neuropathic pain. Targeting this system may have therapeutic benefit."

Approximately 60% of patients suffering from acute spinal cord injury (SCI) develop pain within days to weeks after injury, which ultimately persists into chronic stages. To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods. We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results. A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 +/- 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion. While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes. Early intervention with anticonvulsants may have effects beyond pain management and warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in human SCI."

Despite gradual recovery of hindlimb motor function after spinal cord injury, mice exhibited continuous development of mechanical hypersensitivity. Gabapentin (30 and 100 mg/kg) and pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally on the 28th day after spinal cord injury, reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner.

Recovery of locomotor function was assessed with an open field test and scored using the open field test scale (BBB scale). Somatosensory tests of paw withdrawal responses accompanied by supraspinal responses to both mechanical punctate (von Frey hairs) and nonpunctate (4 mm diameter blunt probe) as well as thermal (radiant heat) peripheral stimuli were performed. Comparisons at the level of the individual animal between precontusion and postcontusiom responses indicated significant increases in reactions to low threshold punctate mechanical stimuli, non-punctate stimuli and thermal stimuli (p < 0,05), To demonstrate the validity of this model as a central pain model, gabapentin, an agent used clinically for central pain, was given i.p, at 10 or 30 mg/kg, Gabapentin treatment significantly and reversibly changed the responses, consistent with the attenuation of the abnormal sensory behavior, and the attenuated responses lasted for the duration of the drug effect (up to 6 h), These results support the use of the spinal contusion model in the study of chronic central pain after SCI."

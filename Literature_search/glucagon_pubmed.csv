Growing evidences have reported stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signalling axis provides neuroprotection in experimental models of neurodegeneration disease. Endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4), resulting in blocking of GLP-1/GLP1R signalling process. Sitagliptin, a highly selective inhibitor of DPP4, has approved to have beneficial effects on diseases in which neurons damaged. However, the roles and the underlying mechanisms of sitagliptin in SCI repairing remain unclear. In this study, we used a rat model of SCI and PC12 cells/primary cortical neurons to explore the mechanism of sitagliptin underlying SCI recovery. We discovered the expression of GLP-1R decreased in the SCI model. Administration of sitagliptin significantly increased GLP-1R protein level, alleviated neuronal apoptosis, enhanced axon regeneration and improved functional recovery following SCI. Nevertheless, treatment with exendin9-39, a GLP-1R inhibitor, remarkably reversed the protective effect of sitagliptin. Additionally, we detected the AMPK/PGC-1α signalling pathway was activated by sitagliptin stimulating GLP-1R. Taken together, sitagliptin may be a potential agent for axon regrowth and locomotor functional repair via GLP-1R-induced AMPK/ PGC-1α signalling pathway after SCI."

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, has be shown to have neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the potential benefits of liraglutide as well as the underlying mechanisms for its therapeutic benefit for SCI are unclear. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic benefits and decipher the potential signaling pathways of liraglutide in spinal contusion injury. A SD rat model with controlled spinal contusion was established for this study. Behavioral tests and histological examinations were performed to assess the neuroprotective benefits. Several autophagy markers were measured by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining, including LC3B, Beclin-1 and p62. In addition, the AMPK-FOXO3 signaling pathway was investigated. Our results demonstrated that liraglutide treatment strongly enhanced motor function recovery and alleviated the degree of necrosis and loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord tissue after contusion. Autophagic responses were activated by liraglutide. LC3B-II/LC3B-I and Beclin-1 expression was enhanced while p62 expression was reduced. In addition, the levels of p-AMPK/AMPK, FOXO3 and p-FOXO3 (phospho S253) were notably up-regulated by liraglutide. These effects were partly reversed by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. In summary, our results demonstrated that liraglutide was therapeutically beneficial in treating spinal contusion injury and its underlying mechanism was through the activation of autophagic responses through the AMPK-FOXO3 signaling pathway."

Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2 (SERCA2) plays an important role in regulating calcium homeostasis, which has been shown to inhibit apoptosis. Exendin-4 has been shown to inhibit the apoptosis of nerve cells in SCI, which can also improve SERCA2 expression. In this study, we sought to determine whether exendin-4 plays a protective role in a rat model of SCI via SERCA2. To investigate the effects of exendin-4 on SCI, a rat model of SCI was induced by a modified version of Allen's method. Spinal cord tissue sections from rats and western blot analysis were used to examine SERCA2 expression after treatment with the long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor exendin-4 or the SERCA2 antagonist 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CE). Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale and slanting board test. Cell apoptosis was increased with CE treatment and decreased with exendin-4 treatment. Upregulation of SERCA2 in female rats with SCI resulted in an improvement of motor function scores and histological changes. These findings suggest that exendin-4 plays a protective role in a rat model of SCI through SERCA2 via inhibition of apoptosis. Existing drugs targeting SERCA2 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCI."

This study aimed to determine the effects and potential mechanism of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist extendin-4 (Ex-4) in SCI. Seventy-two male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, 2.5 μg Ex-4, and 10 μg Ex-4 groups. To induce SCI, a 10-g iron rod was dropped from a 20-mm height to the spinal cord surface. Ex-4 was administered via intraperitoneal injection immediately after surgery. Motor function evaluation with the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale indicated significantly increased scores (p < 0.01) in the Ex-4-treated groups, especially 10 μg, which demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Ex-4 after SCI. The light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Beclin 1 protein expression determined via western blot and the number of autophagy-positive neurons via immunofluorescence double labeling were increased by Ex-4, which supports promotion of autophagy (p < 0.01). The caspase-3 protein level and neuronal apoptosis via transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)/NeuN/DAPI double labeling were significantly reduced in the Ex-4-treated groups, which indicates anti-apoptotic effects (p < 0.01). Finally, histological assessment via Nissl staining demonstrated the Ex-4 groups exhibited a significantly greater number of surviving neurons and less cavity (p < 0.01). To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that Ex-4 significantly enhances motor function in rats after SCI, and these effects are associated with the promotion of autophagy and inhibition of apoptosis."

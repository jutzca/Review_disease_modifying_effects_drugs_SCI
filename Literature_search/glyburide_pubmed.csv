Progressive haemorrhagic necrosis (PHN) represents an increasingly well-characterised mechanism of secondary injury after tSCI that negatively impacts neurological outcomes following acute tSCI. Preclinical studies evaluating the use of the Food and Drug Administration-approved sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel blocker glyburide in rodent models have shown reduced secondary microhaemorrhage formation and the absence of capillary fragmentation, the pathological hallmark of PHN. In this initial phase multicentre open-label pilot study, we propose to enrol 10 patients with acute cervical tSCI to primarily assess the feasibility, and safety of receiving oral glyburide within 8 hours of injury. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and preliminary evaluations on neurological recovery as well as blood and MRI-based injury biomarkers. Analysis will be performed using the descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Glyburide has been shown as an effective neuroprotective agent in preclinical tSCI models and in the treatment of ischaemic stroke with the additional risk of a hypoglycaemic response. Given the ongoing secondary injury and the traumatic hyperglycaemic stress response seen in patients with tSCI, glyburide; thus, offers an appealing neuroprotective strategy to supplement standard of care treatment. The study protocol was approved by the Ohio State University Biomedical Institutional Review Board. The protocol was amended in February 2017 with changes related to study feasibility and patient recruitment. Specifically, the route of administration was changed to the oral form to allow for streamlined and rapid drug administration, and the injury-to-drug time window was extended to 8 hours in an effort to further enhance enrolment. Participants or legally authorised representatives are informed about the trial and its anticipated risks orally and in written form using an approved informed consent form prior to inclusion. The findings of this study will be disseminated to the participants and to academic peers through scientific conferences and peer-reviewed journal publications. NCT02524379 and 2014H0335."

Timely delivery of specialized care has reduced mortality; however, long-term neurological recovery continues to be limited. In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority. Collaborative international efforts have led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for traumatic SCI based on robust evaluation of current evidence. The current article provides an in-depth review of progress in SCI, covering the above areas."

There are many important differences between spinal cord injury in experimental animals and in human clinical cases, making it difficult to introduce new therapies into clinical practice. Spinal cord injury is also common in pet dogs and requires new effective therapies, meaning that they can act as a translational model for the human condition while also deriving direct benefits from such research. In this study we investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of glyburide in dogs with clinical spinal cord injury. We recruited dogs that had incurred an acute thoracolumbar spinal cord injury within the previous 72 h. These had become acutely non-ambulatory on the pelvic limbs and were admitted to our veterinary hospitals to undergo anesthesia, cross sectional diagnostic imaging, and surgical decompression. Oral glyburide was given to each dog at a dose of 75 mcg/kg. In five dogs, we measured blood glucose concentrations for 10 h after a single oral dose. In six dogs, we measured serum glyburide and glucose concentrations for 24 h and estimated pharmacokinetic parameters to estimate a suitable dose for use in a subsequent clinical trial in similarly affected dogs. No detrimental effects of glyburide administration were detected in any participating dog. Peak serum concentrations of glyburide were attained at a mean of 13 h after dosing, and mean apparent elimination half-life was approximately 7 h. Observed mean maximum plasma concentration was 31 ng/mL. At the glyburide dose administered there was no observable association between glyburide and glucose concentrations in blood. Our data suggest that glyburide can be safely administered to dogs that are undergoing anesthesia, imaging and surgery for treatment of their acute spinal cord injury and can attain clinically-relevant serum concentrations without developing hazardous hypoglycemia. Serum glyburide concentrations achieved in this study suggest that a loading dose of 150 mcg/kg followed by repeat doses of 75 mcg/kg at 8-hourly intervals would lead to serum glyburide concentrations of 25-50 ng/mL within an acceptably short enough period after oral administration to be appropriate for a clinical trial in canine spinal cord injury."

As neuropathic pain is refractory to many treatments and some drugs only present partial efficacy, it is essential to study new targets and mechanisms to ameliorate pain signs. For this reason we have used glibenclamide (GB), a blocker of KATP channels that are over expressed in microglia under activation conditions. GB has already been used to trigger the early scavenger activity of microglia, so we administer it to promote a better removal of dead cells and myelin debris and support the microglia neuroprotective phenotype. Our results indicate that a single dose of GB (1 μg) injected after spinal cord injury is sufficient to promote long-lasting functional improvements in locomotion and coordination. Nevertheless, the Randall-Selitto test measurements indicate that these improvements are accompanied by enhanced mechanical hyperalgesia. In vitro results indicate that GB may influence microglial phagocytosis and therefore this action may be at the basis of the results obtained in vivo."

Our goal was to replicate pre-clinical data from Simard et al. (2007) showing that glibenclamide, an FDA approved anti-diabetic drug that targets sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)-regulated Ca(2+) activated, [ATP](i)-sensitive nonspecific cation channels, attenuates secondary intraspinal hemorrhage and secondary neurodegeneration caused by hemicontusion injury in rat cervical spinal cord. In an initial replication attempt, the Infinite Horizons impactor was used to deliver a standard unilateral contusion injury near the spinal cord midline. Glibenclamide was administered continuously via osmotic pump beginning immediately post-SCI. The ability of glibenclamide to limit intraspinal hemorrhage was analyzed at 6, 12 and 24 h post-injury using a colorimetric assay. Acute recovery (24 h) of forelimb function was also assessed. Analysis of data from these initial studies revealed no difference between glibenclamide and vehicle-treated SCI rats. Later, it was determined that differences in primary trauma affect the efficacy of glibenclamide. Indeed, the magnitude and distribution of primary intraspinal hemorrhage was greater when the impact was directed to the dorsomedial region of the cervical hemicord (as in our initial replication experiment), as compared to the dorsolateral spinal cord (as in the Simard et al. experiment). In three subsequent experiments, injury was directed to the dorsolateral spinal cord. In each case, glibenclamide reduced post-traumatic hemorrhage 24-48 h post-injury. In the third experiment, we also assessed function and found that acute reduction of hemorrhage led to improved functional recovery. Thus, independent replication of the Simard et al. data was achieved. These data illustrate that the injury model and type of trauma can determine the efficacy of pre-clinical pharmacological treatments after SCI."

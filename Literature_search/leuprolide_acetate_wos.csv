Specifically, in the case of spinal injuries, these factors can stimulate neuronal recovery. They are applied both in experimental models and in clinical trials in patients. The trophic factors analysed in this review include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), growth hormone (GH), melatonin, oestrogens, the family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), the family of neurotrophins and the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). There are some trophic (neurotrophic) factors that already been tested in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), but only shown partial recovery effect. It is possible that, the administration of these trophic factors together with physical rehabilitation, act synergistically and, therefore, significantly improve the quality of life of patients with SCI."

The aim of this study was to establish whether treatment with LA improves sensitivity, motor activity and independence in patients with chronic SCI. Patients were treated LA once a month for six months. They were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of treatment; using a sensitivity and motor impairment scale, according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), and grade of independence scale; employing the spinal cord independence measure (SCIM). Statistical analysis showed a significant improvement in the ASIA sensory score and the SCIM score when comparing the initial versus final evaluation after six months of LA administration. Some patients showed an increase in frequency of bowel movements. Treatment with LA induces improvements in sensitivity, motor activity and independence in patients with chronic SCI. One advantage of this protocol is that it is a non-invasive method of easy and safe application, with few side effects."

This study was designed to determine whether administration of leuprolide acetate can improve locomotor behavior, gait, micturition reflex, spinal cord morphology and the amount of microglia in the lesion epicenter after spinal cord injury in rats. Rats with spinal cord compression injury were administered leuprolide acetate or saline solution for 5 weeks. At the 5th week, leuprolide acetate-treated rats showed locomotor activity recovery by 38%, had improvement in kinematic gait and exhibited voiding reflex recovery by 60%, as compared with the 1st week. By contrast, saline solution-treated rats showed locomotor activity recovery only by 7%, but voiding reflex did not recover. More importantly, leuprolide acetate treatment reduced microglial immunological reaction and induced a trend towards greater area of white and gray matter in the spinal cord. Therefore, leuprolide acetate has great potential to repair spinal cord injury."

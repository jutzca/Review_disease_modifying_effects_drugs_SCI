Prior research has shown that nociceptive input can increase cell death, expand the area of hemorrhage, and impair long-term recovery. The current study shows that these adverse effects can be blocked by the sodium channel blocker lidocaine applied rostral to a contusion injury. Rats received a lower thoracic (T12) contusion injury, and noxious electrical stimulation (shock) was applied to the tail 24 h later. Immediately before shock treatment, a pharmacological transection was performed by slowly infusing lidocaine at T2. Long-term locomotor recovery was assessed over the next 21 days. Noxious electrical stimulation impaired locomotor recovery, and this effect was blocked by rostral lidocaine. Next, the acute effect of lidocaine was assessed. Tissue was collected 3 h after noxious stimulation, and the extent of hemorrhage was evaluated by assessing hemoglobin content using Western blotting. Nociceptive stimulation increased the extent of hemorrhage. Lidocaine applied at T2 before, but not immediately after, stimulation blocked this effect. A similar pattern of results was observed when lidocaine was applied at the site of injury by means of a lumbar puncture. The results show that a pharmacological transection blocks nociception-induced hemorrhage and exacerbation of locomotor deficits."

We examined the transient effect of daily lidocaine administration into the posteromedial part of the greater trochanter on sciatic nerve function using electrophysiological examination and histopathology of the sciatic nerve. Rats were divided into three groups: an SCI group (SCI without treatment), an SCI with electroacupuncture treatment (SCI-EA) group, and an SCI with nerve block and electroacupuncture (SCI-NB-EA) group (nerve block was achieved by lidocaine administration to transiently block the ascending peripheral nerve pathway). Behavioral tests and electrophysiological examinations were performed to evaluate recovery of neurological function. Sciatic nerve conduction was normal immediately before daily lidocaine administration. Histopathological analysis also indicated normal sciatic nerve, confirming that lidocaine nerve blockade was suitable and reversible for transiently eliminating nerve transmission. Neurological function in the SCI-EA group was superior to that in the SCI group, while no differences were found between the SCI and SCI-NB-EA groups. Electroacupuncture treatment can promote recovery of neurological function. Facilitation of nerve conduction may play an important role in this recovery."

Neurophysiological and neuroprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A novel implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system enables targeted drug delivery and induction of temporary paraplegia in awake, behaving nonhuman primates. Three macaques displayed loss of voluntary leg movement for 60-90 min after injection of lidocaine with epinephrine, followed by a full recovery. This technique for the first time will enable ethical live recording from the proximal central nervous system during the acute onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia."

In a clinically relevant spinal cord contusion injury model, prior work has shown that noxious stimulation at an intensity that engages pain (C) fibers soon after injury augments secondary injury and impairs functional recovery. Noxious input increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β and 18), cellular signals associated with cell death (caspase 3 and 8), and physiological signs of hemorrhage. Here, it is shown that reducing neural excitability after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the local anesthetic lidocaine (micro-injected by means of a lumbar puncture) blocks these adverse cellular effects. In contrast, treatment with an analgesic dose of morphine had no effect. Contused rats that received nociceptive stimulation soon after injury exhibited poor locomotor recovery, less weight gain, and greater tissue loss at the site of injury. Prophylactic application of lidocaine blocked the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation on behavioral recovery and reduced tissue loss from secondary injury. The results suggest that quieting neural excitability using lidocaine can reduce the adverse effect of pain input (from polytrauma or surgery) after SCI."

Recent findings are reviewed that show SCI places the caudal tissue in a vulnerable state that exaggerates the effects nociceptive stimuli and promotes the development of nociceptive sensitization. Stimulation that is both unpredictable and uncontrollable induces a form of maladaptive plasticity that enhances nociceptive sensitization and impairs spinally mediated learning. In contrast, relational learning induces a form of adaptive plasticity that counters these adverse effects. SCI sets the stage for nociceptive sensitization by disrupting serotonergic (5HT) fibers that quell overexcitation. The loss of 5HT can enhance neural excitability by reducing membrane-bound K+-Cl- cotransporter 2, a cotransporter that regulates the outward flow of Cl-. This increases the intracellular concentration of Cl-, which reduces the hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Uncontrollable noxious stimulation also undermines the recovery of locomotor function, and increases behavioral signs of chronic pain, after a contusion injury. Nociceptive stimulation has a greater effect if experienced soon after SCI. This adverse effect has been linked to a downregulation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an upregulation in the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor. Noxious input enhances tissue loss at the site of injury by increasing the extent of hemorrhage and apoptotic/pyroptotic cell death. Intrathecal lidocaine blocks nociception-induced hemorrhage, cellular indices of cell death, and its adverse effect on behavioral recovery. Clinical implications are discussed."

In this study, we examined the effect of QX-314, a potent Na+ channel blocker, on recovery after SCI in vivo. QX-314 (2.0 and 10 nmol) or vehicle was microinjected (2 microL) into the injury site 15 min after SCI. Injury was performed by compression of the spinal cord at C7-T1 for 1 min with a modified aneurysm clip exerting a closing force of 35 g. Neurological function was assessed 1 day after injury and weekly thereafter until 6 weeks by the inclined plane method and by the modified Tarlov technique. After 6 weeks of injury, the origin of descending axons at the injury site was determined by retrograde labeling with fluorogold (FG), and a computer-assisted morphometric assessment of the injury site was performed. There was a significant improvement in counts of retrogradely labeled neurons in the red nucleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in rats treated with either 2 nM (1338 +/- 366 and 28.8 +/- 16) or 10 nM (1390 +/- 511 and 46.3 +/- 31) QX-314 as compared to vehicle (902 +/- 403 and 13.8 +/- 8). There was a trend to increased neuronal counts in the sensorimotor cortex (170.8 +/- 226.8) and vestibular nuclei (1096.2 +/- 970.2) with QX-314 (10 nM) as compared to the vehicle-treated group. There was no significant difference in the extent of neurological recovery between the control and treated groups. Our results suggest that the Na+ channel blocker QX-314 partially preserves the integrity of descending motor axons after SCI. However, in this study, the effects were insufficient to result in sustained improvements in behavioral neurological function."

Hypothermia, thiopental, magnesium, lidocaine, and naloxone were used to pretreat the spinal cord prior to ischemia. Hypothermia and thiopental provided comparable protection: they each increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits in 50% of the animals from 26 to 41 minutes. They also increased from 10 to 30 minutes the time that the postsynaptic waves of the spinal somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) could be absent and the animal still have neurological recovery. Hypothermia and thiopental, when used together, increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits to 57 minutes in 50% of the animals. Naloxone increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits to 36 minutes in 50% of the animals, and increased to 20 minutes the time that the postsynaptic waves of the SSEP could be absent and the animal still have neurological recovery. Magnesium pretreatment improved neurological outcome, possibly by improving collateral circulation as the SSEP did not fail completely during aortic occlusion in all animals. Lidocaine was not beneficial, perhaps because of the prolonged hypotension that resulted."

The spinal cord was injured by the rapid inflation of an epidural balloon at T-6. The physiological integrity of the spinal cord ceased within 2 seconds in all animals, as demonstrated by acute disappearance of the somatosensory evoked response (SER). There was essentially no return of the SER in the five untreated animals when monitored for 4 hours post-injury. All of the pathological specimens from these animals revealed severe central cord hemorrhage. Intravenous lidocaine was begun 15 minutes after the injury in five animals. Three of these animals had significant return of the SER. The pathological specimens from the lidocaine-treated animals revealed either mild or moderate central cord hemorrhage. The results of this experiment suggest that systemic lidocaine administration has a significant beneficial effect in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury."

The main objective of this study is to ascertain whether combinational therapy of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) together with lithium chloride improves cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in a rat spinal contusion model, or not. Contusive spinal cord injury was implemented on Wistar male rats. Experimental groups comprised of: control, hNSCs transplanted, lithium chloride (Li), and hNSCs and lithium chloride (hNSCs + Li). In every experimental group, locomotor activity score and motor evoked potential (MEP) were performed to evaluate motor recovery as well as histological assessments to determine mechanisms of improvement. In accordance with our results, the hNSCs + Li and the Li groups showed significant improvement in locomotor scores and MEP. Also, Histological assessments revealed that transplanted hNSCs are capable of differentiation and migration along the spinal cord. Although NESTIN-positive cells were proliferated significantly in the Lithium group in comparison with control and the hNSCs + Li groups, the quantity of ED1 cells in the hNSCs + Li was significantly larger than the other two groups. Our results demonstrate that combinational therapy of hNSCs with lithium chloride and lithium chloride individually are adequate for ameliorating more than partial functional recovery and endogenous repair in spinal cord-injured rats."

Preventing cell death by improving endogenous regenerative capability could an effective strategy for the treatment of SCI. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) on the cell survival through overexpression of BDNF and NT3 mRNA level and their receptors in the contusion rat models. Rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups (eight rats/group) including: contused animals (the non-treatment group); contused animals (the control group) which received laminectomy; contused animals received normal saline (vehicle)and contused animals received intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg LiCl three days after surgery. Injection continued for 14 days as treatment. Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale was used to assess the motor function of the rats. To evaluate the histopathological and gene expression analysis, rats were sacrificed 28 days after surgery. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to obtain the relative levels of mRNA for BDNF, NT3 and their receptors. The results showed LiCl ameliorates BBB scores via up-regulation of BDNF and TrkB receptors. Also, histological analysis showed that the numerical density per area of TUNEL- positive cells and the percentage of cavity significantly decreased in the LiCl-treated group. Our findings suggest that LiCl protects neural cells and effectively enhances locomotor function, which was done through up-regulation of endogenous BDNF expression in rats with SCI.

In the lithium and 3-MA groups, rats were intraperitoneally injected with lithium (LiCl; 30 mg/kg) 6 hours after SCI and thereafter once daily until sacrifice. At 2, 3 and 4 weeks after SCI, neurological function and diffusion tensor imaging indicators were remarkably improved in the lithium group compared with the SCI and 3-MA groups. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale score and fractional anisotropy values were increased, and the apparent diffusion coefficient value was decreased. Immunohistochemical staining showed that immunoreactivities for Beclin-1 and light-chain 3B peaked 1 day after SCI in the lithium and SCI groups. Immunoreactivities for Beclin-1 and light-chain 3B were weaker in the 3-MA group than in the SCI group, indicating that 3-MA inhibits lithium-induced autophagy. Furthermore, NeuN+ neurons were more numerous in the lithium group than in the SCI and 3-MA groups, with the fewest in the latter. Our findings show that lithium reduces neuronal damage after acute SCI and promotes neurological recovery by inducing autophagy. The neuroprotective mechanism of action may not be entirely dependent on the enhancement of autophagy, and furthermore, 3-MA might not completely inhibit all autophagy pathways."

We injected NSCs into tibial nerve and transplanted tibial nerve into a hemisected spinal cord and investigated the effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) on the survival of spinal neurons, axonal regeneration, and functional recovery. Our results show that most of the transplanted NSCs expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, while there was no obvious expression of nestin, neuronal nuclei, or acetyltransferase found in NSCs. LiCl treatment produced less macrosialin (ED1) expression and axonal degeneration in tibial nerve after NSC injection. Our results also show that a regimen of LiCl treatment promoted NSC differentiation into NF200-positive neurons with neurite extension into the host spinal cord. The combination of tibial nerve transplantation with NSCs and LiCl injection resulted in more host motoneurons surviving in the spinal cord, more regenerated axons in tibial nerve, less glial scar area, and decreased ED1 expression. We conclude that lithium may have therapeutic potential in cell replacement strategies for central nervous system injury due to its ability to promote survival and neuronal generation of grafted NSCs and reduced host immune reaction."

Usually, lithium is used as a popular mood stabilizer. Recently, growing evidence has shown that lithium has clear neuroprotective effects after SCI, and the administration of lithium can effectively improve locomotor recovery. However, the exact neuroprotective mechanism of lithium is still not understood. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the neuroprotective effects of lithium both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we discovered that lithium inhibits GSK3β activity through two different signaling pathways in spinal cord neurons. In the acute phase, lithium inhibited GSK3β activity by stimulating phosphorylation of AKT; in the chronic phase, we first discovered that lithium additionally upregulated the expression of Na+, K+-ATPase α1 (NKA α1), which had an inhibitory effect on GSK3β activity by inducing the expression of glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 is well known as a regulator of the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, the suppressed activity of GSK3β increased the level of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which gave rise to the translocation of the freely stabilized β-catenin to the nucleus. In addition, the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus had the benefits of neuronal survival. Hopefully our findings from this study are beneficial in revealing the neuroprotective mechanism of lithium and in offering novel targets for the development of new SCI therapeutic drugs."

We evaluated BSCB status using the Evans Blue dye extravasation test and measurement of tight junction (TJ) protein levels; we also assessed functional locomotor recovery. We detected autophagy-associated proteins in vivo and in vitro using both Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found that, in a rat model of SCI, LiCl attenuated the elevation in BSCB permeability, improved locomotor recovery, and inhibited the degradation of TJ proteins including occludin and claudin-5. LiCl significantly induced the extent of autophagic flux after SCI by increasing LC3-II and ATG-5 levels, and abolishing p62 accumulation. In addition, a combination of LiCl and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine not only partially eliminated the BSCB-protective effect of LiCl, but also exacerbated TJ protein degradation both in vivo and in vitro. Together, these findings suggest that LiCl treatment alleviates BSCB disruption and promotes locomotor recovery after SCI, partly by stimulating autophagic flux."

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of the balance between growth, proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of EA therapy on Wnt/β‑catenin‑regulated gene expression and neuronal recovery in rats with SCI. The Allen method was used to establish SCI in rats, and alterations in Wnt1 and Nestin mRNA and protein expression levels in response to SCI were determined on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post‑injury using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. To evaluate the effects of EA treatment on SCI, the following four treatment groups were employed: SCI, SCI + EA, SCI + lithium chloride (LiCl) and SCI + LiCl + EA. The protein expression levels of Wnt1, Nestin and nuclear β‑catenin were evaluated on day 3 post‑treatment, and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) protein expression levels were evaluated on day 21 post‑treatment using western blot analysis. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scoring method was used to evaluate spinal cord recovery on day 28 post‑treatment across the four treatment groups. EA therapy at the Dazhui and Mingmen acupuncture points significantly increased the expression levels of Wnt1, Nestin, β‑catenin and NeuN, thus suggesting that EA therapy may promote spinal cord recovery following injury. The underlying mechanism was demonstrated to involve enhanced Wnt/β‑catenin signaling, which may promote the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. However, further studies are required to elucidate the detailed effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of EA therapy on SCI."

The effect of a GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl), on the regeneration of axotomized RST neurons was also assessed. Adult rats received a unilateral hemisection at the seventh cervical spinal cord segment (C7). Four weeks after different treatments, regeneration of RST axons across the lesion scar was examined by injection of Fluoro-Gold at spinal segment T2, and locomotor recovery was studied by a test of forelimb usage. Injured RST axons did not regenerate spontaneously after spinal cord injury, and intraperitoneal injection of LiCl alone did not promote the regeneration of RST axons. Administration of ChABC at the lesion site enhanced the regeneration of RST axons by 20%. Combined treatment of LiCl together with ChABC significantly increased the regeneration of RST axons to 42%. Animals receiving combined treatment used both forelimbs together more often than animals that received sham or single treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LiCl induced the expression of inactive GSK-3beta as well as the upregulation of Bcl-2 in injured RST neurons. These results indicate that in vivo, LiCl inhibits GSK-3beta and reinforces the regeneration-promoting function of ChABC through a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism. Combined use of LiCl together with ChABC could be a novel treatment for spinal cord injury."

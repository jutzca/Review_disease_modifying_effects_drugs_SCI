Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that AC105 would lead to greater tissue sparing at the injury site and improved behavioral outcome when delivered in a clinically realistic time window post-injury. Four hours after contusion/compression injury, Yucatan minipigs were randomized to receive a 30-min intravenous infusion of AC105, magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), or saline. Animals received 4 additional infusions of the same dose at 6-h intervals. Behavioral recovery was tested for 12 weeks using two-dimensional (2D) kinematics during weight-supported treadmill walking and the Porcine Injury Behavior Scale (PTIBS), a 10-point locomotion scale. Spinal cords were evaluated ex vivo by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subjected to histological analysis. Treatment with AC105 or MgSO4 did not result in improvements in locomotor recovery on the PTIBS or in 2D kinematics on weight-supported treadmill walking. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed severe loss of tissue integrity at the impact site, with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity; this was not improved with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Histological analysis revealed no significant increase in gray or white matter sparing with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Finally, AC105 did not result in higher Mg2+ levels in CSF than with the use of standard MgSO4. In summary, when testing AC105 in a porcine model of SCI, we were unable to reproduce the promising therapeutic benefits observed previously in less-severe rodent models of SCI."

Here, we used intravenous injection of endothelial-binding lectin followed by histology to show that the number of perfused microvessels at the injury site is decreased by 80-90% as early as 20 min following a moderate T9 contusion in adult female rats. Hemorrhage within the spinal cord also was maximal at 20 min, consistent with its vasoconstrictive actions in the central nervous system (CNS). Microvascular blood flow recovered to up to 50% of normal volume in the injury penumbra by 6 h, but not at the epicenter. A comparison with an endothelial cell marker suggested that many microvessels fail to be reperfused up to 48 h post-injury. The ischemia was probably caused by vasospasm of vessels penetrating the parenchyma, because repeated Doppler measurements over the spinal cord showed a doubling of total blood flow over the first 12 h. Moreover, intravenous infusion of magnesium chloride, used clinically to treat CNS vasospasm, greatly improved the number of perfused microvessels at 24 and 48 h. The magnesium treatment seemed safe as it did not increase hemorrhage, despite the improved parenchymal blood flow. However, the treatment did not reduce acute microvessel, motor neuron or oligodendrocyte loss, and when infused for 7 days did not affect functional recovery or spared epicenter white matter over a 4 week period. These data suggest that microvascular blood flow can be restored with a clinically relevant treatment following spinal cord injury."

Riluzole and magnesium have been widely investigated as neuroprotective agents in animal models of spinal cord injury. As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we aimed to investigate if their neuroprotective efficacy could be cumulative."

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to be neuroprotective against excitotoxic, ischemic, and traumatic injury to the CNS, while acute posttraumatic treatment with magnesium (Mg2+) has been shown to decrease the motor and cognitive deficits following experimental brain injury. In this study, bFGF and Mg2+ were evaluated separately and in combination to assess their potential additive effects on posttraumatic neurological recovery and histological cell loss (lesion volume). Twenty minutes after fluid percussion (FP) brain injury of moderate severity (2.2-2.4 atm), anesthetized rats received a 15-min intravenous infusion of either 125 mu mol of MgCl2 or vehicle, followed 5 min later by a 24-h constant intravenous infusion of either bFGF (16 mu g/h) or vehicle. Injured animals had a significant motor deficit when compared to sham (uninjured) animals at both 48 h and 7 days postinjury. At 48 h postinjury, there were no significant differences among injured animals when compared by treatment, By 7 days postinjury, injured animals treated with MgCl2 alone displayed significantly improved motor function when compared to brain-injured, vehicle-treated animals (p < 0.05). Animals treated with either bFGF alone or a combination of MgCl2 and bFGF displayed no significant neurological improvement relative to vehicle-treated injured animals at 7 days. No effect of any drug treatment or combination was observed on the extent of the postinjury lesion volume in the injured cortex. These results suggest that caution must be exercised when combining ""cocktails"" of potentially neuroprotective compounds in the setting of traumatic brain injury."

Numerous investigators have reported the neuroprotective benefits of magnesium in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) as well, but typically with doses that far exceed human tolerability. To develop magnesium into a clinically relevant therapy for SCI, further refinement and improvement of the magnesium formulation is necessary. In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007). We established that the 254 mu mol/ kg dose of MgCl2 was superior to 127 mu mol/ kg MgCl2 with respect to tissue sparing and locomotor recovery. Additionally, the number of infusions (2, 4, or 6), time between infusions (6 vs 8 hours), and different magnesium salts (MgCl2 vs MgSO4) were evaluated to determine an ""optimal"" treatment regimen. We observed that an ""optimized"" regimen of MgCl2 within PEG conferred greater tissue neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery compared to methylprednisolone. Further a 4 hour time window of histologic and behavioral efficacy was established. The goal of these experiments was to help guide the treatment parameters for a clinical trial of magnesium within a polyethylene glycol formulation in acute human spinal cord injury."

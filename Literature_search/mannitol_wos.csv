Aims: To investigate the effect of mannitol on Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP), postoperative neurological recovery and ultrastructural findings after an experimental SCI. Setting: The experimental microsurgery laboratory of a university hospital. Design: A prospective, randomized animal study. Material and Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into three groups (Groups I-III) for this study. Those in Group I were control animals who underwent laminectomy only, and non-traumatized spinal cord samples were obtained 2 weeks later. SCI was produced in Groups II and III using clip compression technique, and cord samples were obtained 2 weeks later. The rats in Group 11 received 2 g/kg of 20% mannitol intraperitoneally, immediately and three hours after trauma was induced; and those in Group III received the same amount of 0,9% NaCl in the same manner. Preoperative and postoperative SSEP records at the end of 2 weeks were obtained. Electron microscopy examination of the cord samples was done at 2 weeks postoperatively. Statistical Analysis used: Fischer's Exact Test. Results: SSEP records, ultrastructural findings and clinical recovery showed that minor neural damage and significant recovery occurred in Group II. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the administration of 2 g/kg of 20% mannitol produces significant improvement in the neural structures and protects the spinal cord following injury."

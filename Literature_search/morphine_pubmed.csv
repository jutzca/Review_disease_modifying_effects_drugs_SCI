The objective of this study was to characterize opioid administration in people with acute SCI and examine the association between opioid dose and (1) changes in motor/functional scores from hospital to rehabilitation discharge, and (2) pain, depression, and quality of life (QOL) scores 1-year post injury. Spinal Cord Injury Model System (SCIMS) inpatient acute rehabilitation facility. Patients included in the SCIMS from 2008 to 2011 were linked to the National Trauma Registry and the electronic medical record. Three opioid dose groups (low, medium, and high) were defined based on the total morphine equivalence in milligrams at 24 h. The associations between opioid dose groups and functional/motor outcomes were assessed, as well as 1-year follow-up pain and QOL surveys. In all, 85/180 patients had complete medication records. By 24 h, all patients had received opioids. Patients receiving higher amounts of opioids had higher pain scores 1 year later compared with medium- and low-dose groups (pain levels 5.5 vs. 4 vs. 1, respectively, p = 0.018). There was also an 8× greater risk of depression 1 year later in the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group (OR: 8.1, 95% CI: 1.2-53.7). In analyses of motor scores, we did not find a significant interaction between opioid dose and duration of injury. These preliminary findings suggest that higher doses of opioids administered within 24 h of injury are associated with increased pain in the chronic phase of people with SCI."

Spinally-injured patients receive opioids within hours of arrival at the emergency room, and prolonged opioid regimens are often employed for the management of post-SCI chronic pain. However, previous studies in our laboratory suggest that the effects of opioids such as morphine may be altered in the pathophysiological context of neurotrauma. Specifically, we have shown that morphine administration in a rodent model of SCI increases mortality and tissue loss at the injury site, and decreases recovery of motor and sensory function, and overall health, even weeks after treatment. The literature suggests that opioids may produce these adverse effects by acting as endotoxins and increasing glial activation and inflammation. To better understand the effects of morphine following SCI, in this study we used flow cytometry to assess immune-competent cells at the lesion site. We observed a morphine-induced increase in the overall number of CD11b+ cells, with marked effects on microglia, in SCI subjects. Next, to investigate whether this increase in the inflammatory profile is necessary to produce morphine's effects, we challenged morphine treatment with minocycline. We found that pre-treatment with minocycline reduced the morphine-induced increase in microglia at the lesion site. More importantly, minocycline also blocked the adverse effects of morphine on recovery of function without disrupting the analgesic efficacy of this opioid. Together, our findings suggest that following SCI, morphine may exacerbate the inflammatory response, increasing cell death at the lesion site and negatively affecting functional recovery."

Mice were given morphine twice daily for 7 days after unilateral tibial fracture and intramedullary pin fixation to model orthopedic surgery and limb trauma. Mechanical allodynia, limb-specific weight bearing, gait changes, memory, and anxiety were measured after injury. In addition, spinal cord gene expression changes as well as glial activation were measured. Finally, the authors assessed the effects of a selective Toll-like receptor 4 antagonist, TAK-242, on nociceptive and functional changes after injury. Tibial fracture caused several weeks of mechanical nociceptive sensitization (F(1, 216) = 573.38, P < 0.001, fracture + vehicle vs. sham + vehicle, n = 10 per group), and this change was exacerbated by the perioperative administration of morphine (F(1, 216) = 71.61, P < 0.001, fracture + morphine vs. fracture + vehicle, n = 10 per group). In additional testing, injured limb weight bearing, gait, and object location memory were worse in morphine-treated fracture mice than in untreated fracture mice. Postfracture expression levels of several genes previously associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and prodynorphin, were unchanged, but neuroinflammation involving Toll-like receptor 4 receptor-expressing microglia was observed (6.8 ± 1.5 [mean ± SD] cells per high-power field for fracture + vehicle vs. 12 ± 2.8 fracture + morphine, P < 0.001, n = 8 per /group). Treatment with a Toll-like receptor 4 antagonist TAK242 improved nociceptive sensitization for about 2 weeks in morphine-treated fracture mice (F(1, 198) = 73.36, P < 0.001, fracture + morphine + TAK242 vs. fracture + morphine, n = 10 per group). Morphine treatment beginning at the time of injury impairs nociceptive recovery and other outcomes. Measures preventing glial activation through Toll-like receptor 4 signaling may reduce the adverse consequences of postoperative opioid administration."

Unfortunately, current pain management is inadequate for many SCI patients. Rodent models could help identify how SCI pain develops, explore new treatment strategies, and reveal whether acute post-SCI morphine worsens chronic pain. However, few studies explore or compare SCI-elicited neuropathic pain in rats. Here, we sought to determine how different clinically relevant contusion SCIs in male and female rats affect neuropathic pain, and whether acute morphine worsens later chronic SCI pain. First, female rats received sham surgery, or 150kDyn or 200kDyn midline T9 contusion SCI. These rats displayed modest mechanical allodynia and long-lasting thermal hyperalgesia. Next, a 150kDyn (1s dwell) midline contusion SCI was performed in male and female rats. Interestingly, males, but not females showed SCI-elicited mechanical allodynia; rats of both sexes had thermal hyperalgesia. In this model, acute morphine treatment had no significant effect on chronic neuropathic pain symptoms. Unilateral SCIs can also elicit neuropathic pain that could be exacerbated by morphine, so male rats received unilateral T13 contusion SCI (100kDyn). These rats exhibited significant, transient mechanical allodynia, but not thermal hyperalgesia. Acute morphine did not exacerbate chronic pain. Our data show that specific rat contusion SCI models cause neuropathic pain. Further, chronic neuropathic pain elicited by these contusion SCIs was not amplified by our course of early post-trauma morphine. Using clinically relevant rat models of SCI could help identify novel pain management strategies."

In a clinically relevant spinal cord contusion injury model, prior work has shown that noxious stimulation at an intensity that engages pain (C) fibers soon after injury augments secondary injury and impairs functional recovery. Noxious input increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β and 18), cellular signals associated with cell death (caspase 3 and 8), and physiological signs of hemorrhage. Here, it is shown that reducing neural excitability after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the local anesthetic lidocaine (micro-injected by means of a lumbar puncture) blocks these adverse cellular effects. In contrast, treatment with an analgesic dose of morphine had no effect. Contused rats that received nociceptive stimulation soon after injury exhibited poor locomotor recovery, less weight gain, and greater tissue loss at the site of injury. Prophylactic application of lidocaine blocked the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation on behavioral recovery and reduced tissue loss from secondary injury. The results suggest that quieting neural excitability using lidocaine can reduce the adverse effect of pain input (from polytrauma or surgery) after SCI."

Despite its analgesic efficacy, however, our studies suggest that intrathecal morphine undermines locomotor recovery and increases lesion size in a rodent model of SCI. Similarly, intravenous (IV) morphine attenuates locomotor recovery. The current study explores whether IV morphine also increases lesion size after a spinal contusion (T12) injury and quantifies the cell types that are affected by early opioid administration. Using an experimenter-administered escalating dose of IV morphine across the first seven days post-injury, we quantified the expression of neuron, astrocyte, and microglial markers at the injury site. SCI decreased NeuN expression relative to shams. In subjects with SCI treated with IV morphine, virtually no NeuN+ cells remained across the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion. Further, whereas SCI per se increased the expression of astrocyte and microglial markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein and OX-42, respectively), morphine treatment decreased the expression of these markers. These cellular changes were accompanied by attenuation of locomotor recovery (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores), decreased weight gain, and the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (increased tactile reactivity) in morphine-treated subjects. These data suggest that morphine use is contraindicated in the acute phase of a spinal injury. Faced with a lifetime of intractable pain, however, simply removing any effective analgesic for the management of SCI pain is not an ideal option. Instead, these data underscore the critical need for further understanding of the molecular pathways engaged by conventional medications within the pathophysiological context of an injury."

Unfortunately, we have shown that morphine administered in the acute phase of SCI results in significant, adverse secondary consequences including compromised locomotor and sensory recovery. Similarly, we showed that selective activation of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), even at a dose 32-fold lower than morphine, is sufficient to attenuate recovery of locomotor function. In the current study, we tested whether activation of the KOR is necessary to produce morphine's adverse effects using nor-Binaltorphimine (norBNI), a selective KOR antagonist. Rats received a moderate spinal contusion (T12) and 24 h later, baseline locomotor function and nociceptive reactivity were assessed. Rats were then administered norBNI (0, 0.02, 0.08, or 0.32 μmol) followed by morphine (0 or 0.32 μmol). Nociception was reassessed 30 min after drug treatment, and recovery was evaluated for 21 days. The effects of norBNI on morphine-induced attenuation of recovery were dose dependent. At higher doses, norBNI blocked the adverse effects of morphine on locomotor recovery, but analgesia was also significantly decreased. Conversely, at low doses, analgesia was maintained, but the adverse effects on recovery persisted. A moderate dose of norBNI, however, adequately protected against morphine's adverse effects without eliminating its analgesic efficacy. This suggests that activation of the KOR system plays a significant role in the morphine-induced attenuation of recovery. Our research suggests that morphine, and other opioid analgesics, may be contraindicated for the SCI population. Blocking KOR activity may be a viable strategy for improving the safety of clinical opioid use."

Current therapies for treating this type of pain are ineffective and often have dose-limiting side effects. Although opioids are one of the most commonly used CNP treatments, recent animal literature has indicated that administering opioids shortly after a traumatic injury can actually have deleterious effects on long-term health and recovery. In order to study the deleterious effects of administering morphine shortly after trauma, we employed our low thoracic (T13) dorsal root avulsion model (Spinal Neuropathic Avulsion Pain, SNAP). Administering a weeklong course of 10mg/kg/day morphine beginning 24h after SNAP resulted in amplified mechanical allodynia. Co-administering the non-opioid toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist (+)-naltrexone throughout the morphine regimen prevented morphine-induced amplification of SNAP. Exploration of changes induced by early post-trauma morphine revealed that this elevated gene expression of TLR4, TNF, IL-1β, and NLRP3, as well as IL-1β protein at the site of spinal cord injury. These data suggest that a short course of morphine administered early after spinal trauma can exacerbate CNP in the long term. TLR4 initiates this phenomenon and, as such, may be potential therapeutic targets for preventing the deleterious effects of administering opioids after traumatic injury."

We used specific opioid receptor agonists to assess the effects of μ- (DAMGO), δ- (DPDPE) and κ- (GR89696) opioid receptor activation on locomotor (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale, tapered beam and ladder tests) and sensory (girdle, tactile and tail-flick tests) recovery in a rodent contusion model (T12). We also tested the contribution of non-classic opioid binding using [+]- morphine. First, a dose-response curve for analgesic efficacy was generated for each opioid agonist. Baseline locomotor and sensory reactivity was assessed 24 h after injury. Subjects were then treated with an intrathecal dose of a specific agonist and re-tested after 30 min. To evaluate the effects on recovery, subjects were treated with a single dose of an agonist and both locomotor and sensory function were monitored for 21 days. All agonists for the classic opioid receptors, but not the [+]- morphine enantiomer, produced antinociception at a concentration equivalent to a dose of morphine previously shown to produce strong analgesic effects (0.32 μmol). DAMGO and [+]- morphine did not affect long-term recovery. GR89696, however, significantly undermined the recovery of locomotor function at all doses tested. On the basis of these data, we hypothesize that the analgesic efficacy of morphine is primarily mediated by binding to the classic μ-opioid receptor. Conversely, the adverse effects of morphine may be linked to activation of the κ-opioid receptor. Ultimately, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of morphine is imperative to develop safe and effective pharmacological interventions in a clinical setting. USA.

Moreover, drugs like morphine, though critical for pain management, elicit pro-inflammatory effects that exacerbate chronic pain symptoms. Previous reports showed that SCI results in the induction and suppression of several microRNAs (miRNAs), both at the site of injury, as well as in segments of the spinal cord distal to the injury site. We hypothesized that morphine would modulate the expression of these miRNAs, and that expression of these SCI-sensitive miRNAs may predict adaptation of distal nociceptive circuitry following SCI. To determine whether morphine treatment further dysregulates SCI-sensitive miRNAs, their expression was examined by qRT-PCR in sham controls and in response to vehicle and morphine treatment following contusion in rats, at either 2 or 15 days post-SCI. Our data indicated that expression of miR1, miR124, and miR129-2 at the injury site predicted the nociceptive response mediated by spinal regions distal to the lesion site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the interaction of SCI with adaptation of functionally intact distal sensorimotor circuitry. Moreover, the SCI-induced miRNA, miR21 was induced by subsequent morphine administration, representing an alternate, and hitherto unidentified, maladaptive response to morphine exposure. Contrary to predictions, mRNA for the pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R), an identified target of SCI-sensitive miRNAs, was also induced following SCI, indicating dissociation between miRNA and target gene expression. Moreover, IL6R mRNA expression was inversely correlated with locomotor function suggesting that inflammation is a predictor of decreased spinal cord function. Collectively, our data indicate that miR21 and other SCI-sensitive miRNAs may constitute therapeutic targets, not only for improving functional recovery following SCI, but also for attenuating the effects of SCI on pain sensitivity."

There is concern surrounding the use of these analgesics, however, because use is often associated with the development of addiction. Previous data suggests that this concern may not be relevant in the presence of neuropathic pain. Yet, despite the common prescription of opioids for the treatment of SCI-related pain, there has been only one previous study examining the addictive potential of morphine following spinal injury. To address this, the present study used a self-administration paradigm to examine the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI. Animals were placed into self-administration chambers 24 h, 14 d, or 35 d following a moderate spinal contusion injury. They were placed into the chambers for seven 12-hour sessions with access to 1.5 mg morphine/lever depression (up to 30 mg/d). In the acute phase of SCI, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than their sham counterparts, as previously shown. However, contused animals showing signs of neuropathic pain did not self-administer less morphine than their sham counterparts when administration began 14 or 35 d after injury. Instead, these animals administered nearly the full amount of morphine available each session. This amount of morphine did not affect recovery of locomotor function but did cause significant weight loss. We suggest caution is warranted when prescribing opioids for the treatment of neuropathic pain resulting from SCI, as the addictive potential is not reduced in this model."

Recent reports have demonstrated safety and efficacy of mini-open removal of these tumors using expandable tubular retractors. The authors report their experience with the minimally invasive removal of extradural foraminal and intradural-extramedullary tumors using the nonexpandable tubular retractor. A retrospective chart review of consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive resection of spinal tumors at Notre Dame Hospital was performed. Between December 2005 and March 2012, 13 patients underwent minimally invasive removal of spinal tumors at Notre Dame Hospital, Montreal. There were 6 men and 7 women with a mean age of 55 years (range 20-80 years). There were 2 lumbar and 2 thoracic intradural-extramedullary tumors and 7 thoracic and 2 lumbar extradural foraminal tumors. Gross-total resection was achieved in 12 patients. Subtotal resection (90%) was attained in 1 patient because the tumor capsule was adherent to the diaphragm. The average duration of surgery was 189 minutes (range 75-540 minutes), and the average blood loss was 219 ml (range 25-500 ml). There were no major procedure-related complications. Pathological analysis revealed benign schwannoma in 8 patients and meningioma, metastasis, plasmacytoma, osteoid osteoma, and hemangiopericytoma in 1 patient each. The average equivalent dose of postoperative narcotics after surgery was 66.3 mg of morphine. The average length of hospitalization was 66 hours (range 24-144 hours). All working patients returned to normal activities within 4 weeks. The average MRI and clinical follow-up were 13 and 21 months, respectively (range 2-68 months). At last follow-up, 92% of patients had improvement or resolution of pain with a visual analog scale score that improved from 7.8 to 1.2. All patients with neurological impairment improved. The American Spinal Injury Association grade improved in all but 1 patient. Intradural-extramedullary and extradural tumors can be completely and safely resected through a minimally invasive approach using the nonexpandable tubular retractor. This approach may be associated with even less tissue destruction than mini-open techniques, translating into a quicker functional recovery. In cases of foraminal tumors, by eliminating the need for facetectomy, this minimally invasive approach may decrease the incidence of postoperative deformity and eliminate the need for adjunctive fusion surgery."

Although some studies suggest that the addictive potential of morphine decreases when it is used to treat neuropathic pain, this has not been studied in a SCI model. Accordingly, the present studies investigated the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI using conditioned place preference (CPP) and intravenous self-administration paradigms. A contusion injury significantly increased the expression of a CPP relative to sham and intact controls in the acute phase of injury. However, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than sham and intact controls, but this was dose-dependent; at a high concentration, injured rats exhibited an increase in drug-reinforced responses over time. Exposure to a high concentration of morphine impeded weight gain and locomotor recovery. We suggest that the increased preference observed in injured rats reflects a motivational effect linked in part to the drug's anti-nociceptive effect. Further, although injured rats exhibited a suppression of opiate self-administration, when given access to a high concentration, addictive-like behavior emerged and was associated with poor recovery."

Two-hundred and one patients were randomized to 1 of 4 analgesic epidural pastes at the time of lumbar spinal surgery: combination paste (morphine + methylprednisolone), steroid paste (methylprednisolone alone), morphine paste (morphine alone), or placebo. The primary outcome measures used were analgesic consumption and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Secondary outcome measures were: modified American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) score, Short Form 36 General Health Survey (SF-36), Aberdeen Pain Index (ABPI), time to ambulation and time to discharge from hospital. Administration of combination and steroid paste, but not morphine paste, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI) components of the MPQ in the first 3 days after surgery. Likewise, postoperative in-patient narcotic analgesic consumption was reduced in the combination paste and steroid paste group, but not in the morphine paste group. No difference in time to ambulation or discharge, SF-36 scores, ABPI scores, or neurologic recovery was observed. An analgesic paste containing methylprednisolone acetate is effective at reducing postoperative pain after lumbar decompressive surgery. Mixing effective doses of morphine sulfate in the paste abrogates the expected analgesic effects of epidural morphine."

Unfortunately, our previous studies show that administration of a single dose of morphine, in the acute phase of a moderate spinal contusion injury, significantly attenuates locomotor function, reduces weight gain, and produces symptoms of paradoxical pain (Hook et al., 2009). The current study focused on the cellular mechanisms that mediate these effects. Based on data from other models, we hypothesized that pro-inflammatory cytokines might play a role in the morphine-induced attenuation of function. Experiment 1 confirmed that systemic morphine (20 mg/kg) administered one day after a contusion injury significantly increased expression levels of spinal IL-1β 24 h later. Experiment 2 extended these findings, demonstrating that a single dose of morphine (90 μg, i.t.) applied directly onto the spinal cord increased expression levels of spinal IL-1β at both 30 min and 24 h after administration. Experiment 3 showed that administration of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, i.t.) prior to intrathecal morphine (90 μg), blocked the adverse effects of morphine on locomotor recovery. Further, pre-treatment with 3 μg IL-1ra prevented the increased expression of at-level neuropathic pain symptoms that was observed 28 days later in the group treated with morphine-alone. However, the IL-1ra also had adverse effects that were independent of morphine. Treatment with the IL-1ra alone undermined recovery of locomotor function, potentiated weight loss and significantly increased tissue loss at the injury site. Overall, these data suggest that morphine disrupts a critical balance in concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, and this undermines recovery of function."

Moreover, a single dose of systemic morphine in the early stage of injury (24 h post-injury) led to symptoms of neuropathic pain 3 weeks later, in the chronic phase. The present study examines the locus of the effects using intrathecal morphine administration. Subjects were treated with one of three doses (0, 30, or 90 microg) of intrathecal morphine 24 h after a moderate contusion injury. The 90-microg dose produced significant analgesia when subjects were exposed to noxious stimuli (thermal and incremented shock) below the level of injury. Yet, despite analgesic efficacy, intrathecal morphine significantly attenuated the recovery of locomotor function and increased lesion size rostral to the injury site. A single dose of 30 or 90 microg of intrathecal morphine also decreased weight gain, and more than doubled the incidence of mortality and autophagia when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Morphine is one of the most effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain and, therefore, is indispensable for the spinally injured. Treatment can, however, adversely affect the recovery process. A morphine-induced attenuation of recovery may result from increases in immune cell activation and, subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the contused spinal cord."

These data imply that nociceptive input (e.g., from tissue damage) can enhance the loss of function after injury, and that potential clinical treatments, such as pretreatment with an analgesic, may protect the damaged system from further secondary injury. The current study examined this hypothesis and showed that a potential treatment (morphine) did not have a protective effect. In fact, morphine appeared to exacerbate the effects of nociceptive stimulation. Experiment 1 showed that after spinal cord injury 20mg/kg of systemic morphine was necessary to induce strong antinociception and block behavioral reactivity to shock treatment, a dose that was much higher than that needed for sham controls. In Experiment 2, contused rats were given one of three doses of morphine (Vehicle, 10, 20mg/kg) prior to exposure to uncontrollable electrical stimulation or restraint alone. Despite decreasing nociceptive reactivity, morphine did not attenuate the long-term consequences of shock. Rats treated with morphine and shock had higher mortality rates, and displayed allodynic responses to innocuous sensory stimuli three weeks later. Independent of shock, morphine per se undermined recovery of sensory function. Rats treated with morphine alone also had significantly larger lesions than those treated with saline. These results suggest that nociceptive stimulation affects recovery despite a blockade of pain-elicited behavior. The results are clinically important because they suggest that opiate treatment may adversely affect the recovery of function after injury."

Epidural morphine, 4 mg, was given for pain relief. After anesthesia, the patient displayed lower extremity paraparesis. This effect was reversed by naloxone. The authors sought to confirm these observations using a rat spinal ischemia model to define the effects of intrathecal morphine administered at various times after reflow on behavior and spinal histopathology. Spinal cord ischemia was induced for 6 min using an intraaortic balloon. Morphine or saline, 30 microg, was injected intrathecally at 0.5, 2, or 24 h after reflow. In a separate group, spinal cord temperature was decreased to 27 degrees C before ischemia. After ischemia, recovery of motor function was assessed periodically using the motor deficit index (0 = complete recovery; 6 = complete paraplegia). After ischemia, all rats showed near-complete recovery of function by 4-6 h. Intrathecal injection of morphine at 0.5 or 2 h of reflow (but not at 24 h) but not saline caused a development of hind limb dysfunction and lasted for 4.5 h (motor deficit index score = 4-6). This effect was reversed by intrathecal naloxone (30 microg). Intrathecal morphine administered after hypothermic ischemia was without effect. Histopathological analysis in animals that received intrathecal morphine at 0.5 or 2 h after ischemia (but not at 24 h) revealed dark-staining alpha motoneurons and interneurons. Intrathecal saline or spinal hypothermia plus morphine was without effect. These data indicate that during the immediate reflow following a noninjurious interval of spinal ischemia, intrathecal morphine potentiates motor dysfunction. Reversal by naloxone suggests that this effect results from an opioid receptor-mediated potentiation of a transient block of inhibitory neurons initiated by spinal ischemia."

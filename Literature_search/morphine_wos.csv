Repeated systemic administration of morphine (RSAM) can induce activation of astrocytes in the spinal cord. Moreover, previous studies also revealed neuroprotective effects of morphine. Therefore, we investigated the effect of RSAM during an acute stage of SCI on neurological outcome in rats. RSAM significantly improved the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score from 7 d after SCI and the inclined plane score from 14 d after SCI. However, the differences in thermal nociceptive thresholds and tactile sensory thresholds between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. RSAM increased expression levels of spinal IL-17, and decreased plasma levels of IL-17 at 1 d and 3 d after SCI. Furthermore, RSAM promoted activation of astrocytes around the damaged area, which prevented the spreading of damage into the surrounding tissue. At 28 d after SCI, RSAM preserved a greater area of white matter. These observations suggest that RSAM during an acute stage of SCI promotes recovery of locomotor function without promoting development of hyperalgesia and allodynia."

Objectives The objective of this study was to characterize opioid administration in people with acute SCI and examine the association between opioid dose and (1) changes in motor/functional scores from hospital to rehabilitation discharge, and (2) pain, depression, and quality of life (QOL) scores 1-year post injury. Setting Spinal Cord Injury Model System (SCIMS) inpatient acute rehabilitation facility. Methods Patients included in the SCIMS from 2008 to 2011 were linked to the National Trauma Registry and the electronic medical record. Three opioid dose groups (low, medium, and high) were defined based on the total morphine equivalence in milligrams at 24 h. The associations between opioid dose groups and functional/motor outcomes were assessed, as well as 1-year follow-up pain and QOL surveys. Results In all, 85/180 patients had complete medication records. By 24 h, all patients had received opioids. Patients receiving higher amounts of opioids had higher pain scores 1 year later compared with medium- and low-dose groups (pain levels 5.5 vs. 4 vs. 1, respectively,p = 0.018). There was also an 8x greater risk of depression 1 year later in the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group (OR: 8.1, 95% CI: 1.2-53.7). In analyses of motor scores, we did not find a significant interaction between opioid dose and duration of injury. Conclusions These preliminary findings suggest that higher doses of opioids administered within 24 h of injury are associated with increased pain in the chronic phase of people with SCI."

Continuous use of opioid drugs during osteoarthritic pain induces tolerance and may result in dose escalation and abuse. Sigma-1 (sigma 1) receptors, a chaperone expressed in key areas for pain control, modulates mu-opioid receptor activity and represents a promising target to tackle these problems. The present study investigates the efficacy of the sigma 1 receptor antagonist E-52862 to inhibit pain sensitization, morphine tolerance, and associated electrophysiological and molecular changes in a murine model of osteoarthritic pain. Experimental Approach Mice received an intra-knee injection of monoiodoacetate followed by 14-day treatment with E-52862, morphine, or vehicle, and mechanical sensitivity was assessed before and after the daily doses. Key Results Monoiodoacetate-injected mice developed persistent mechanical hypersensitivity, which was dose-dependently inhibited by E-52862. Mechanical thresholds assessed before the daily E-52862 dose showed gradual recovery, reaching complete restoration by the end of the treatment. When repeated treatment started 15 days after knee injury, E-52862 produced enhanced short-term analgesia, but recovery to baseline threshold was slower. Both a sigma 1 receptor agonist and a mu receptor antagonist blocked the analgesic effects of E-52862. An acute, sub-effective dose of E-52862 restored morphine analgesia in opioid-tolerant mice. Moreover, E-52862 abolished spinal sensitization in osteoarthritic mice and inhibited pain-related molecular changes. Conclusion and Implications These findings show dual effects of sigma 1 receptor antagonism alleviating both short- and long-lasting antinociception during chronic osteoarthritis pain. They identify E-52862 as a promising pharmacological agent to treat chronic pain and avoid opioid tolerance."

Despite being mostly studied independently from each other, important interactions exist between them in the context of spinal cord injury, whether to the spinal cord or the body. Ongoing or recent past episodes of nociceptive activity can prevent motor learning in spinalized rats. In intact animals, it has been proposed that supraspinal activity could counter the repressive effect of nociception on motor system plasticity, but this has not yet been verified in behavioral conditions. The aim of this study was to test whether a recent episode of nociception affects subsequent motor learning in intact animals. We trained rodents to walk on a custom-made horizontal ladder. After initial training, the rats underwent a week-long rest, during which they were randomly assigned to a control group, or one out of two pain conditions. Nociceptive stimuli of different durations were induced through capsaicin or Complete Freund's Adjuvant injections and timed so that the mechanical hypersensitivity had entirely subsided by the end of the resting period. Training then resumed on a modified version of the horizontal ladder. We evaluated the animals' ability to adapt to the modified task by measuring their transit time and paw misplacements over 4 days. Our results show that prior pain episodes do affect motor learning in neurologically intact rats. Motor learning deficits also seem to be influenced by the duration of the pain episode. Rats receiving a subcutaneous injection of capsaicin displayed immediate signs of mechanical hypersensitivity, which subsided rapidly. Nonetheless, they still showed learning deficits 24 h after injection. Rats who received a Complete Freund's Adjuvant injection displayed mechanical hypersensitivity for up to 7 days during the resting period. When trained on the modified ladder task upon returning to normal sensitivity levels, these rats exhibited more prolonged motor learning deficits, extending over 3 days. Our results suggest that prior pain episodes can negatively influence motor learning, and that the duration of the impairment relates to the duration of the pain episode. Our results highlight the importance of addressing pain together with motor training after injury."

When the thoracic aorta and the bilateral internal mammary arteries were occluded for 10 min, the potentials were completely depressed. Reappearance of these potentials could be observed at about 10 min after removal of the occlusion and they gradually recovered. Intravenous injection of naloxone (1 or 10 mg/kg) or levallorphan (0.1 mg/kg) together with removal of occlusion significantly promoted the recovery of the polysynaptic reflex potential. Morphine (5 mg/kg) showed no particular effect on the recovery of potentials. Furthermore, pretreatment with morphine (5 mg/kg) did not influence the effects of these opioid antagonists. These results suggest that naloxone and levallorphan may preserve or potentiate the interneuronal activities of the lumbo-sacral spinal cord under the ischemic condition and that the effects may not be mediated through morphine-like opioid receptors."

Response thresholds for disruption of bar press activity (44.8 degrees C) and heart rate elevation (44.4 degrees C) were statistically equivalent. No differences in thresholds for either response end point were found between the left and right hindlimbs, thus validating the consistency of the technique and reproducibility of the stimulus delivery device during test periods of 3-4 weeks. Advantages of the method include the use of two independent end points that are determined objectively, performance criteria that do not rely upon motor responses from the stimulated limb and the use of quantitative descriptors that enables comparisons to be made between different test groups. The method combines behavior with cardiovascular and somatosensory function in a way that can be used for the assessment of spinal and supraspinal pathways involved in thermal detection in the unanesthetized, behaviorally active rat."

Unfortunately, we have shown that morphine administered in the acute phase of SCI results in significant, adverse secondary consequences including compromised locomotor and sensory recovery. Similarly, we showed that selective activation of the k-opioid receptor (KOR), even at a dose 32-fold lower than morphine, is sufficient to attenuate recovery of locomotor function. In the current study, we tested whether activation of the KOR is necessary to produce morphine's adverse effects using nor-Binaltorphimine (norBNI), a selective KOR antagonist. Rats received a moderate spinal contusion (T12) and 24 h later, baseline locomotor function and nociceptive reactivity were assessed. Rats were then administered norBNI (0, 0.02, 0.08, or 0.32 mu mol) followed by morphine (0 or 0.32 mu mol). Nociception was reassessed 30 min after drug treatment, and recovery was evaluated for 21 days. The effects of norBNI on morphine-induced attenuation of recovery were dose dependent. At higher doses, norBNI blocked the adverse effects of morphine on locomotor recovery, but analgesia was also significantly decreased. Conversely, at low doses, analgesia was maintained, but the adverse effects on recovery persisted. A moderate dose of norBNI, however, adequately protected against morphine's adverse effects without eliminating its analgesic efficacy. This suggests that activation of the KOR system plays a significant role in the morphine-induced attenuation of recovery. Our research suggests that morphine, and other opioid analgesics, may be contraindicated for the SCI population. Blocking KOR activity may be a viable strategy for improving the safety of clinical opioid use."

Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury."

Thus, peripheral injuries experienced by SO patients, even if not initially perceived, could result in a persistent and widespread activation of dorsal horn neurons and emerge as chronic pain with interventive repair or modest recovery from SCI. To visualize the spinal neuron response to peripheral tissue injury following complete SO in rats, the neural transcription factor Fos was quantitated in the spinal cord. Two weeks following either a complete transection of the spinal cord at the level of T8 or a sham surgery (laminectomy), rats were injected with formalin into the left hind paw. Sham-operated rats demonstrated biphasic hind paw pain-related behavior following formalin injection, but transected rats displayed fewer behaviors in the second (tonic) phase. Stereological analysis of the sham group revealed that the extent of formalin-induced Fos expression was within the lumbar dorsal horn, with numerous Fos-like immunoreactive profiles in the ipsilateral dorsal horn and some contralateral immunoreactive profiles. In contrast, the level of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the transected group was significantly elevated and expanded in range compared to the sham group, with increases observed in the normal laminar distribution regions, as well as multi-segmentally through sacral levels and increases in the contralateral dorsal horn segments. The data demonstrate that widespread activation of spinal, especially dorsal horn, neurons following peripheral insult can occur in the injured spinal cord, despite reduced pain responsiveness, and suggests that exaggerated pain may emerge as spinal recovery or repair progresses.

One day following injection, there was a dramatic decrease in acetylated histone 3 expression in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. However, on day 7, expression recovered in adjuvant-injected rats. While acetylated histone 3 labeling was present in dorsal horn neurons, it was more abundant in astrocytes and microglial cells. The recovery of acetylated histone 3 expression was associated with a shift in expression of the protein from neurons to glial cells. Morphine injection significantly upregulated the expression of acetylated histone 3 in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons and glial cells 1 day after injection, especially in astrocytes, preventing the transient downregulation. Our results indicate that inflammatory pain induces a transient downregulation of acetylated histone 3 in the spinal cord dorsal horn at an early stage following adjuvant injection, and that this effect can be reversed by morphine.

Spinally-injured patients receive opioids within hours of arrival at the emergency room, and prolonged opioid regimens are often employed for the management of post-SCI chronic pain. However, previous studies in our laboratory suggest that the effects of opioids such as morphine may be altered in the pathophysiological context of neurotrauma. Specifically, we have shown that morphine administration in a rodent model of SCI increases mortality and tissue loss at the injury site, and decreases recovery of motor and sensory function, and overall health, even weeks after treatment. The literature suggests that opioids may produce these adverse effects by acting as endotoxins and increasing glial activation and inflammation. To better understand the effects of morphine following SCI, in this study we used flow cytometry to assess immune-competent cells at the lesion site. We observed a morphine-induced increase in the overall number of CD11b + cells, with marked effects on microglia, in SCI subjects. Next, to investigate whether this increase in the inflammatory profile is necessary to produce morphine's effects, we challenged morphine treatment with mino-cycline. We found that pre-treatment with minocycline reduced the morphine-induced increase in microglia at the lesion site. More importantly, minocycline also blocked the adverse effects of morphine on recovery of function without disrupting the analgesic efficacy of this opioid. Together, our findings suggest that following SCI, morphine may exacerbate the inflammatory response, increasing cell death at the lesion site and negatively affecting functional recovery."

In preparation to consider clinical trials, the potential neurotoxicologic effects of chronic intrathecal GM1 were studied in ewes. Preliminary in vitro tests first demonstrated the stability and compatibility of GM1 in implanted pumps. Two groups of adult ewes were then implanted with either Therex or Infusaid continuous flow implantable pumps and chronic intrathecal catheters.

Cerebrospinal fluid analyzed for GM1 concentrations by thin layer chromatography revealed no evidence of GM1 accumulation.

Histologic analysis revealed no generalized pattern of neuronal damage, demyelination, gliosis, or axonopathy to distinguish intrathecal normal saline or GM1. In both treated and control groups, the only consistent finding was a pericatheter-associated compression of white matter with axonal dilation, vacuolation, and occasional neuronal loss. Catheter tracts in both groups were also associated with variable leptomeningeal fibroproliferative changes in adjacent dura and pia, at times in conjunction with more generalized duromeningeal thickening.

The current study explores whether IV morphine also increases lesion size after a spinal contusion (T12) injury and quantifies the cell types that are affected by early opioid administration. Using an experimenter-administered escalating dose of IV morphine across the first seven days post-injury, we quantified the expression of neuron, astrocyte, and microglial markers at the injury site. SCI decreased NeuN expression relative to shams. In subjects with SCI treated with IV morphine, virtually no NeuN+ cells remained across the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion. Further, whereas SCI per se increased the expression of astrocyte and microglial markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein and OX-42, respectively), morphine treatment decreased the expression of these markers. These cellular changes were accompanied by attenuation of locomotor recovery (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores), decreased weight gain, and the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (increased tactile reactivity) in morphine-treated subjects. These data suggest that morphine use is contraindicated in the acute phase of a spinal injury. Faced with a lifetime of intractable pain, however, simply removing any effective analgesic for the management of SCI pain is not an ideal option. Instead, these data underscore the critical need for further understanding of the molecular pathways engaged by conventional medications within the pathophysiological context of an injury."

In a clinically relevant spinal cord contusion injury model, prior work has shown that noxious stimulation at an intensity that engages pain (C) fibers soon after injury augments secondary injury and impairs functional recovery. Noxious input increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta and 18), cellular signals associated with cell death (caspase 3 and 8), and physiological signs of hemorrhage. Here, it is shown that reducing neural excitability after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the local anesthetic lidocaine (micro-injected by means of a lumbar puncture) blocks these adverse cellular effects. In contrast, treatment with an analgesic dose of morphine had no effect. Contused rats that received nociceptive stimulation soon after injury exhibited poor locomotor recovery, less weight gain, and greater tissue loss at the site of injury. Prophylactic application of lidocaine blocked the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation on behavioral recovery and reduced tissue loss from secondary injury. The results suggest that quieting neural excitability using lidocaine can reduce the adverse effect of pain input (from polytrauma or surgery) after SCI."

Previous reports showed that SCI results in the induction and suppression of several microRNAs (miRNAs), both at the site of injury, as well as in segments of the spinal cord distal to the injury site. We hypothesized that morphine would modulate the expression of these miRNAs, and that expression of these SCI-sensitive miRNAs may predict adaptation of distal nociceptive circuitry following SCI. To determine whether morphine treatment further dysregulates SCI-sensitive miRNAs, their expression was examined by qRT-PCR in sham controls and in response to vehicle and morphine treatment following contusion in rats, at either 2 or 15 days post-SCI. Our data indicated that expression of miR1, miR124, and miR129-2 at the injury site predicted the nociceptive response mediated by spinal regions distal to the lesion site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the interaction of SCI with adaptation of functionally intact distal sensorimotor circuitry. Moreover, the SCI-induced miRNA, miR21 was induced by subsequent morphine administration, representing an alternate, and hitherto unidentified, maladaptive response to morphine exposure. Contrary to predictions, mRNA for the pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R), an identified target of SCI-sensitive miRNAs, was also induced following SCI, indicating dissociation between miRNA and target gene expression. Moreover, IL6R mRNA expression was inversely correlated with locomotor function suggesting that inflammation is a predictor of decreased spinal cord function. Collectively, our data indicate that miR21 and other SCI-sensitive miRNAs may constitute therapeutic targets, not only for improving functional recovery following SCI, but also for attenuating the effects of SCI on pain sensitivity.

Although some studies suggest that the addictive potential of morphine decreases when it is used to treat neuropathic pain, this has not been studied in a SCI model. Accordingly, the present studies investigated the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI using conditioned place preference (CPP) and intravenous self-administration paradigms. A contusion injury significantly increased the expression of a CPP relative to sham and intact controls in the acute phase of injury. However, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than sham and intact controls, but this was dose-dependent; at a high concentration, injured rats exhibited an increase in drug-reinforced responses over time. Exposure to a high concentration of morphine impeded weight gain and locomotor recovery. We suggest that the increased preference observed in injured rats reflects a motivational effect linked in part to the drug's anti-nociceptive effect. Further, although injured rats exhibited a suppression of opiate self-administration, when given access to a high concentration, addictive-like behavior emerged and was associated with poor recovery."

Despite widespread use, however, little is known about the secondary consequences of morphine use after SCI. Unfortunately, our previous studies show that administration of a single dose of morphine, in the acute phase of a moderate spinal contusion injury, significantly attenuates locomotor function, reduces weight gain, and produces symptoms of paradoxical pain (Hook et al., 2009). The current study focused on the cellular mechanisms that mediate these effects. Based on data from other models, we hypothesized that pro-inflammatory cytokines might play a role in the morphine-induced attenuation of function. Experiment 1 confirmed that systemic morphine (20 mg/kg) administered one day after a contusion injury significantly increased expression levels of spinal IL-1 beta 24 h later. Experiment 2 extended these findings, demonstrating that a single dose of morphine (90 mu g, it.) applied directly onto the spinal cord increased expression levels of spinal IL-1 beta at both 30 min and 24 h after administration. Experiment 3 showed that administration of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, it.) prior to intrathecal morphine (90 mu g), blocked the adverse effects of morphine on locomotor recovery. Further, pre-treatment with 3 mu g IL-1ra prevented the increased expression of at-level neuropathic pain symptoms that was observed 28 days later in the group treated with morphine-alone. However, the IL-1ra also had adverse effects that were independent of morphine. Treatment with the IL-1ra alone undermined recovery of locomotor function, potentiated weight loss and significantly increased tissue loss at the injury site. Overall, these data suggest that morphine disrupts a critical balance in concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, and this undermines recovery of function.

Current therapies for treating this type of pain are ineffective and often have dose-limiting side effects. Although opioids are one of the most commonly used CNP treatments, recent animal literature has indicated that administering opioids shortly after a traumatic injury can actually have deleterious effects on long-term health and recovery. In order to study the deleterious effects of administering morphine shortly after trauma, we employed our low thoracic (T13) dorsal root avulsion model (Spinal Neuropathic Avulsion Pain, SNAP). Administering a weeklong course of 10 mg/kg/day morphine beginning 24 h after SNAP resulted in amplified mechanical allodynia. Co-administering the non-opioid toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist (+)-naltrexone throughout the morphine regimen prevented morphine-induced amplification of SNAP. Exploration of changes induced by early post-trauma morphine revealed that this elevated gene expression of TLR4, TNF, IL-1 beta, and NLRP3, as well as IL-1 beta protein at the site of spinal cord injury. These data suggest that a short course of morphine administered early after spinal trauma can exacerbate CNP in the long term. TLR4 initiates this phenomenon and, as such, may be potential therapeutic targets for preventing the deleterious effects of administering opioids after traumatic injury. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These data imply that nociceptive input (e.g., from tissue damage) can enhance the loss of function after injury, and that potential clinical treatments, such as pretreatment with an analgesic, may protect the damaged system from further secondary injury. The current study examined this hypothesis and showed that a potential treatment (morphine) did not have a protective effect. In fact, morphine appeared to exacerbate the effects of nociceptive stimulation. Experiment I showed that after spinal cord injury 20 mg/kg of systemic morphine was necessary to induce strong antinociception and block behavioral reactivity to shock treatment, a dose that was much higher than that needed for sham controls. In Experiment 2, contused rats were given one of three doses of morphine (Vehicle, 10, 20 mg/kg) prior to exposure to uncontrollable electrical stimulation or restraint alone. Despite decreasing nociceptive reactivity, morphine did not attenuate the long-term consequences of shock. Rats treated with morphine and shock had higher mortality rates, and displayed allodynic responses to innocuous sensory stimuli three weeks later. Independent of shock, morphine per se undermined recovery of sensory function. Rats treated with morphine alone also had significantly larger lesions than those treated with saline. These results suggest that nociceptive stimulation affects recovery despite a blockade of pain-elicited behavior. The results are clinically important because they suggest that opiate treatment may adversely affect the recovery of function after injury. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Moreover, a single dose of systemic morphine in the early stage of injury (24 h post-injury) led to symptoms of neuropathic pain 3 weeks later, in the chronic phase. The present study examines the locus of the effects using intrathecal morphine administration. Subjects were treated with one of three doses (0, 30, or 90 mg) of intrathecal morphine 24 h after a moderate contusion injury. The 90-mg dose produced significant analgesia when subjects were exposed to noxious stimuli (thermal and incremented shock) below the level of injury. Yet, despite analgesic efficacy, intrathecal morphine significantly attenuated the recovery of locomotor function and increased lesion size rostral to the injury site. A single dose of 30 or 90 mg of intrathecal morphine also decreased weight gain, and more than doubled the incidence of mortality and autophagia when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Morphine is one of the most effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain and, therefore, is indispensable for the spinally injured. Treatment can, however, adversely affect the recovery process. A morphine-induced attenuation of recovery may result from increases in immune cell activation and, subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the contused spinal cord."

PTH develops months after recovery from the nerve crush in response to repeated intermittent low-threshold mechanical stimulation of the reinnervated sciatic nerve skin territory and represents a model of stimulus-induced pain. SNI is characterized by an early and sustained increase in stimulus-evoked pain sensitivity in the intact skin territory of the spared sural nerve after sectioning of the two other terminal branches of the sciatic nerve. We examined the effects of morphine (0.5-10 mg/kg), gabapentin (30-200 mg/kg), MK801 (0.01-0.02 mg/kg), amitriptyline (1025 mg/kg), and carbamazepine (5-7.5 mg/kg) in both models. Morphine, gabapentin, and carbamazepine both reversed and prevented stimulus-induced PTH, whereas MK801 and amitriptyline reduced but did not prevent stimulus-induced PTH. In contrast, the stimulus-evoked behavioral hypersensitivity in the SNI model was poorly modified by these drugs. Independent neuropathic pain models show differential sensitivity to analgesic drug treatment. We suggest that this is due to the different mechanisms responsible for the neuropathic pain-related behavior. Multiple models are required, therefore, to study the mechanisms that contribute to neuropathic pain and to predict analgesic efficacy for different components of the neuropathic pain syndrome."

Both agents produced hyperalgesia as measured by the tail-flick and formalin tests. This enhanced responsivity appears to be specific to pain since (a) no enhanced response was observed to a non-painful stimulus (6 g von Frey hairs), and (b) the effect could not be accounted for by changes in tail skin temperature. In addition, a conditioned taste aversion paradigm was used to examine the possibility that illness-induced hyperalgesia could be conditioned to a novel taste (saccharine). This procedure was successful in producing a conditioned hyperalgesia which was comparable in magnitude and duration to acute illness induced pain facilitation. Taken together, this series of studies suggests that such pain facilitation might have adaptive functions similar to those ascribed to other illness-induced behaviors."

AP inhibited the production of superoxide anion (O-2 center dot). which acted as a modulator for microglial activation, and the analgesic effect of AP was attributed to its anti-microglial activating action. Direct injection of a ROS scavenger inhibited SCI-induced NP. After contusion injury which induces the below-level neuropathic pain (NP), Shuigou and Yanglingquan acupoints were applied. AP relieved mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, while vehicle and simulated AP did not. AP also decreased the proportion of activated microglia, and inhibited both p38MAPK and ERK activation in microglia at the L4-5. Also, the level of prostaglandin E-2 (PGE2), which is produced via ERK signaling and mediates the below-level pain through PGE2 receptor, was reduced by AP. Injection of p38MAPK or ERK inhibitors attenuated NP and decreased PGE2 production. Furthermore, ROS produced after injury-induced p38MAPK and ERK activation in microglia, and mediated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, which were inhibited by AP or a ROS scavenger. AP also inhibited the expression of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, our results suggest that the analgesic effect of AP may be partly mediated by inhibiting ROS-induced microglial activation and inflammatory responses after SCI and provide the possibility that AP can be used effectively as a non-pharmacological intervention for SCI-induced chronic NP in patients.

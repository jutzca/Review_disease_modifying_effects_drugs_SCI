Recovery of baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity after spinal lesions in the rat. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 301: R1584-R1590, 2011. First published September 7, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00295.2011.-Spinal cord injury (SCI) has serious long-term consequences on sympathetic cardiovascular regulation. Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined."

Group A (n=7) was the control group, in which no pharmacologic intervention was applied. In group B (n=7), the ischemic-reperfused spinal cord was treated with the combination of allopurinol (50 mg/kg/day for 3 days before the day of operation) and deferoxamine (Desferal, 50 mg/kg administered intravenously over 3 to 4 hours). The administration of deferoxamine was completed 1 hour before crossclamping. The crossclamp was placed on the descending aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery for 30 minutes. Proximal hypertension was controlled with sodium nitroprusside and volume depletion. Methods of assessment included an evaluation of the neurologic status of the animals by quantitative Tarlov criteria, blood flow by radiolabeled microspheres,and histologic examination of the spinal cord. All animals in the control group, group A, were completely paraplegic with O% recovery by Tarlov criteria at 24 hours after the removal of the crossclamp. In contrast, all animals in group B, in which the combination of allopurinol and deferoxamine was used, completely recovered (100% recovery by Tarlov criteria), and at 24 hours after the ischemic episode they were able to walk with no difficulty and had intact sensation. Functional parameters of these animals fully correlated with the morphologic findings. Widespread acute neuronal injury and vacuolation of neuropil were observed in the control group of animals. In contrast, animals in group B showed much less pronounced morphologic changes after the same period of ischemia. In summary, the combined use of these agents significantly (p<0.001) reduced the incidence of paraplegia induced by aortic crossclamping with 82% additivity."

Animals were exposed to 30 minutes of ischemia that induced lethal, irreversible injury and paraplegia. The experimental groups were as follows: group A (n = 7), control group, receiving no pharmacologic intervention; group B (n = 7), deferoxamine 50 mg/kg/day administered intravenously over 3 to 4 hours before ischemia; group C (n = 7), allopurinol pretreatment 50 mg/kg/day for 3 days; and group D (n = 7), superoxide dismutase 60,000 units administered with 50,000 units before removal of the aortic crossclamp and 10,000 units over 10 minutes of reperfusion. Proximal hypertension was controlled with sodium nitroprusside and volume depletion. The methods of assessment were neurologic by a modified Tarlov criteria and blood flow by radiolabeled microspheres. Results of blood flow assessment confirmed a true ischemic episode of 30 minutes for all animals in all groups. The blood flow fell significantly during ischemia (p < 0.01) and a hyperemic response was evident in the early reperfusion period. AH animals in control group A were paraplegic. The group B (deferoxamine) results were superior; 85 % had grade III function on a modified Tarlov scale, with animals in the group standing and even walking with difficulty. Only one animal in this group had good movements of hind limbs but was unable to stand or walk. Neurologic recovery was limited in the allopurinol group (group C), with 85 % showing slight neurologic recovery with limited movement of the hind limbs. The animals in the superoxide dismutase group (group D) all had good recovery, with strong motor response of hind limbs, but were not able to stand. In summary, the results of this experimental protocol confirmed the possible role of oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury, induced by aortic crossclamping. Moreover, it proved that ischemia-reperfusion injury could be altered by pharmacologic interventions."

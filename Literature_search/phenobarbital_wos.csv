A 39-kg, Labrador Retriever ingested approximated 350 tablets containing 150 mg methionine/tablet and was presented after repeated episodes of vomiting. The on abnormality was posterior ataxia suggestive of spinal cord injury. The animal was treated with iv fluids, steroids and gastrointestinal protectants. Approximated 4.5 h after entering the clinic the dog had a single seizure episode lasting 2-3 min which was treated with phenobarbital. Serum ammonia at that time was normal (0.19 mg/dL). The animal did not show further CNS abnormalities and awoke apparent normal. A musty odor to the breath was noticed through the course of the day, possibly due to volatile mercaptans produced from methionine metabolism. The animal made an uneventful recovery and was discharged the next day."

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects.PurposeThe aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury.MethodsThis was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort.ResultsOf the cohort (n=570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p=0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p=0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p=0.82 in propensity-matched cohort).ConclusionNon-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes."

In this study, female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=5/groupx4: T10-T11 contusion, laminectomy, or naïve) were fasted for 24 h before being submitted to dye recovery assays (Phenol Red solution, 1.5 ml/rat; per oral) on GI emptying/transiting at 48 h or 4 weeks postinjury (p.i.). Compared with controls, SCI significantly increased dye recovery rate (DRR, determined by spectrophotometry) in the duodenum (+84.6%) and stomach (+32.6%), but decreased it in the jejunum (-64.1% and -49.5%) and ileum (-73.6% and -70.1%) at 48 h and 4 weeks p.i., respectively (P<or=0.005, ANOVA with post hoc t-test). Electrophysiological analysis revealed that purinergic fast inhibitory junction potential (IJP) was reduced approximately 30% in the antrum and duodenum of rats 48 h p.i. (numbers of animals/numbers of tissue samples=3/7; P<0.001), and slow IJP was essentially abolished. Immunocytochemistry consequently uncovered significant reductions in the GI vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (i.e. slow IJP mediators) reactivity at 48 h and 4 weeks p.i., suggesting that SCI disrupted interstitial neurotransmission. Importantly, SCI caused discernible atrophy of the GI mucosa and muscle coat (e.g. the two layers of gastric wall were correspondingly 28% and 27% thinner 4 weeks p.i.). We conclude that contusive SCI triggers GI abnormalities with unique pathophysiology and pathology in different segments. Such GI disorders evolve continuously during the entire post-SCI period examined, and may require therapeutic development to target specific underlying mechanisms."

We evaluated the effect of preinjury large bowel emptying on this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 52) were fasted for 24 or 48 hr with water ad libitum and pretreated with lactose (0.8 g) or saline. Next, laminectomy followed or not by complete SCT between T4 and T5 vertebrae was performed. Phenol red recovery in the stomach and proximal, medial, and distal small intestine was determined 1 day later. In animals submitted to 24 hr fasting + saline, SCT increased gastric recovery by 42.8% and decreased medial small intestine recovery by 56.2%, while 48 hr fasting + saline or 24 hr fasting + lactose prevented the inhibition of gastric emptying (GE) in SCT animals. The 48 hr fasting + lactose prevented the inhibition of both GE and gastrointestinal transit. SCT-induced inhibition of upper gastrointestinal motility may involve enhancement of inhibitory reflexes, which can be prevented by large bowel emptying."

However, the mechanism remains unclear. Thus, we established a rat model of acute spinal cord injury using a modified version of Allen's method. Jisuikang (50, 25, and 12.5 g/kg/d) and prednisolone were administered 30 minutes after anesthesia. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale scores and the oblique board test showed improved motor function recovery in the prednisone group and moderate-dose Jisuikang group compared with the other groups at 3-7 days post-injury. The rats in the moderate-dose Jisuikang group recovered best at 14 days post-injury. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that the survival rate of neurons in treatment groups increased after 3-7 days of administration. Further, the structure of neurons and glial cells was more distinct, especially in prednisolone and moderate-dose Jisuikang groups. Western blot assay and immunohistochemistry showed that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in injured segments was maintained at a high level after 7-14 days of treatment. In contrast, expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was down-regulated at 7 days after spinal cord injury. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of BDNF and NGF mRNA was induced in injured segments by prednisolone and Jisuikang. At 3-7 days after injury, the effect of prednisolone was greater, while 14 days after injury, the effect of moderate-dose Jisuikang was greater. These results confirm that Jisuikang can upregulate BDNF and NGF expression for a prolonged period after spinal cord injury and promote repair of acute spinal cord injury, with its effect being similar to prednisolone."

This study was carried out to evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic potential of autologous bone marrow cell (BMC) transplantation in 11 complete spinal cord injured patients at thoracic level. This nonrandomized clinical trial compared the results of autologous BMC transplantation into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumbar puncture (LP) in 11 patients having complete SCI, with 20 patients as control group who received conventional treatment without BMC transplantation. The patients underwent preoperative and follow-up neurological assessments using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale. Then, the participants were followed for 12-33 months. Eleven patients with the mean age of 33.2±8.9 years and 20 patients with the mean age of 33.5±7.2 years were enrolled in the study and in the control group, respectively. None of the patients in the study and control group experienced any adverse reaction and complications, neither after routine treatment nor after cell transplantation. Five patients out of 11 (45.5%) in the study group and three patients in the control group (15%) showed marked recovery, but the result was statistically borderline (P=0.095). We conclude that transplantation of autologous BMC via LP is a feasible and safe technique, but at the moment, no clear answer can be given regarding the clinical potential, despite a potential tendency to treat SCI patients, observed through statistics."

However, side effects combined with a limited efficacy in clinical trials have restricted their usefulness for treatment of SCI patients. Recent studies have shown that incorporation of the nitric oxide releasing moiety into the glucocorticoid structure enhances anti-inflammatory properties and reduces side effects. One compound, a derivative of prednisolone (PRE), (NCX 1015, prednisolone 21 [(4'nitrooxymethyl)benzoate]), has interesting pharmacological properties. Therefore, we investigated its effects on apoptosis and recovery of function in rats after SCI. Rats received subcutaneously vehicle, NCX 1015 or PRE (37 micromol/kg, each) 3.5 h after a standardized thoracic lesion. The treatment was continued once a day for 3 days and the effect of both steroids on apoptosis was examined by immunohistochemistry 24 h after the last injection. NCX 1015 but not PRE reduced TUNEL and activated caspase 3 in both white and ventral gray matter as well as tumor necrosis factor immunoreactivity in ventral horn motorneurons, suggesting that NCX 1015 reduces SCI-induced apoptosis. The effect of NCX 1015 on motor function was then examined by a standard locomotion rating scale (BBB) starting at 1 day after injury and continuing up to 14 days. NCX 1015 improved significantly locomotor activity by 4 days after injury, whereas PRE had an effect equivalent to that of vehicle, thus providing a correlation between the antiapoptotic effect of NCX1015 and its ability to improve recovery of function. The data suggest that NCX 1015 might be a novel experimental therapeutic compound for recovery of function in SCI patients."

Rats received a contusion injury to the spinal cord using the NYU impactor and were treated with vehicle, riluzole (8 mg/kg), MP(30 mg/kg), or riluzole + MP at 2 and 4 h following injury. Animals continued to receive riluzole treatment (8 mg/kg) for a period of 1 week. The animals were then tested weekly for functional recovery using the BBB open field locomotor score. At the end of testing (6 weeks after injury), each spinal cord was examined for the amount of remaining tissue at the injury site and a myelination index was used to quantify remaining axons in the ventromedial white matter. In this study, only the combination treatment was found to significantly improve behavioral recovery as assessed using the BBB open field locomotor scale. In addition, the combination treatment promoted tissue sparing at the lesion epicenter, but had no clear effect on the index of myelination. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the potential beneficial effects of a combination approach in the treatment of traumatic SCI."

Some cases of distant injuries caused by bone wires, and acupuncture needles have been published, but this is the first reported case of delayed thoracic spinal cord damage caused by the migration of a clavicular wire. A 22-year-old male patient was admitted with a clinical picture of spinal shock after performing physiotherapeutic exercises. Two months prior to this, the patient had undergone surgical treatment for a clavicular fracture in a different clinical center. Imaging showed a clavicular wire had migrated into the spinal canal. An early prescription of a spinal cord methyl-prednisolone protective treatment (NASCIS II), the surgical extraction of the foreign body and the rehabilitation exercises were the keys to a quick recovery."

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacological agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger vitamin E (i.e., alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurological recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for treatment of acute neural injury. The glucocorticoid steroid, methyl-prednisolone (MP), has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant doses, improves chronic neurological recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of MP is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions, as evidenced by the efficacy of the novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids, which are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than MP. One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently the subject of phase II clinical trials. Recently, compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-amino-steroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) also have shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds further supports the concept that LP is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacological neuroprotection."

However, the mechanism remains unclear. Thus, we established a rat model of acute spinal cord injury using a modified version of Allen's method. Jisuikang (50, 25, and 12.5 g/kg/d) and prednisolone were administered 30 minutes after anesthesia. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale scores and the oblique board test showed improved motor function recovery in the prednisone group and moderate-dose Jisuikang group compared with the other groups at 3-7 days post-injury. The rats in the moderate-dose Jisuikang group recovered best at 14 days post-injury. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that the survival rate of neurons in treatment groups increased after 3-7 days of administration. Further, the structure of neurons and glial cells was more distinct, especially in prednisolone and moderate-dose Jisuikang groups. Western blot assay and immunohistochemistry showed that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in injured segments was maintained at a high level after 7-14 days of treatment. In contrast, expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was down-regulated at 7 days after spinal cord injury. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of BDNF and NGF mRNA was induced in injured segments by prednisolone and Jisuikang. At 3-7 days after injury, the effect of prednisolone was greater, while 14 days after injury, the effect of moderate-dose Jisuikang was greater. These results confirm that Jisuikang can upregulate BDNF and NGF expression for a prolonged period after spinal cord injury and promote repair of acute spinal cord injury, with its effect being similar to prednisolone."

A growing body of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological evidence has suggested that oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, working in concert with aberrant calcium fluxes and eicosanoid generation in particular, plays a key role in progressive post-traumatic spinal cord degeneration. Of particular importance, lipid peroxidation has been linked to microvascular damage and hypoperfusion which, if severe enough, can lead to a secondary ischemic insult to the tissue. The ability of intensive dosing with the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone to beneficially affect post-traumatic ischemia and to promote chronic neurologic recovery in spinal cord injured animals has been correlated not with its glucocorticoid activity, but rather with the ability to inhibit post-traumatic spinal lipid peroxidation. In view of this, a novel series of non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroids has been developed which lack glucocorticoid activity but are more effective inhibitors of nervous tissue lipid peroxidation than the glucocorticoid steroids. One of these, U74006F, has now been studied in some detail and appears to be a promising new agent for the acute treatment of spinal cord (and brain) trauma. The background and pre-clinical development of this compound to date is reviewed."

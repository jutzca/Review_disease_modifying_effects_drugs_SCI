A 52-year-old man treated with oral dantrolene for spasticity after spinal cord injury was scheduled to undergo irrigation and drainage of a thigh abscess under general anesthesia. He had taken 50 mg oral dantrolene per day for 3 years. Under standard neuromuscular monitoring, anesthesia was performed with propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of ED95 (0.3 mg/kg) of rocuronium could not depress T1 up to 95%. An additional dose of rocuronium depressed T1 completely and decreased the train-of-four (TOF) count to zero. There was no apparent prolongation of the neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium. The TOF ratio was recovered to more than 0.9 within 40 minutes after the last dose of rocuronium. A small dose of oral dantrolene does not prolong the duration of action and recovery of rocuronium."

Propofol has been shown to protect against spinal cord injury. Therefore, this study sought to explore the therapeutic effects of their combination on spinal cord injury. Rat models of spinal cord injury were established using the weight drop method. Rats were subjected to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation via tail vein injection and/or propofol injection via tail vein using an infusion pump. Four weeks after cell transplantation and/or propofol treatment, the cavity within the spinal cord was reduced. The numbers of PKH-26-positive cells and horseradish peroxidase-positive nerve fibers apparently increased in the spinal cord. Latencies of somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials in the hindlimb were noticeably shortened, amplitude was increased and hindlimb motor function was obviously improved. Moreover, the combined effects were better than cell transplantation or propofol injection alone. The above data suggest that the combination of propofol injection and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can effectively improve hindlimb electrophysiological function, promote the recovery of motor funtion, and play a neuroprotective role in spinal cord injury in rats."

However, most general anesthetics, such as isoflurane, are known to suppress SEPs, which might affect the interpretation of the signals. In animal studies, the usage of anesthetics during SEP measurements is inevitable due to which detailed effect of these drugs on the recordings should be known. In this paper, the effect of isoflurane on SEPs was studied in a rat model. Both time and frequency properties of the cortical recordings generated by stimulating the tibial nerve of rat's hindlimb were investigated at three different isoflurane levels. While the anesthetic agent is shown to generally suppress the amplitude of the SEP, the effect was found to be nonlinear influencing more substantially the latter part of waveform. This finding will potentially help us in future work aiming at separating the effects of anesthetics on SEP from those due to injury in the ascending neural pathways."

Devising an efficacious protocol of neuroprotection to arrest excitotoxicity might, therefore, spare a substantial number of neurons and allow later recovery. In vitro preparations of the spinal cord enable detailed measurement of spinal damage evoked by the potent glutamate analogue kainate. Any clinically-relevant neuroprotective treatment should start after the initial lesion and spare networks for at least 24 h when cell damage plateaus. Using this strategy, we have observed that the gas anesthetic methoxyflurane provided strong, delayed neuroprotection. It is unclear if this beneficial effect was due to the mechanism of action by methoxyflurane, or it was the consequence of anesthetic depression. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect by propofol (commonly injected i.v. for general anesthesia) after kainate excitotoxicity induced on organotypic spinal slices. At 5 mu M concentration, propofol significantly attenuated cell death, including neuronal losses and, especially, damage to the highly vulnerable motoneurons. The action by propofol was fully prevented when co-applied with the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline, indicating that neuroprotection required intact GABAA receptor function. Although bicuculline per se was not neurotoxic, it largely enhanced the lesional effects of kainate, suggesting that GABAA receptor activity could limit excitotoxicity. Our data might offer an explanation for the beneficial clinical outcome of neurosurgery performed as soon as possible after spinal lesion: we posit that general anesthesia contributes to this outcome, regardless of the type of anesthetic used.

An interesting hypothesis is that the general anaesthetic itself might largely contribute to neuroprotection, although invivo clinical settings hamper studying this possibility directly. To further test neuroprotective effects of a widely used general anaesthetic, we studied if propofol could change the outcome of a rat isolated spinal cord SCI model involving excitotoxicity evoked by 1h application of kainate with delayed consequences on neurons and locomotor network activity. Propofol (5m; 4-8h) enhanced responses to GABA and depressed those to NMDA together with decrease in polysynaptic reflexes that partly recovered after 1day washout. Fictive locomotion induced by dorsal root stimuli or NMDA and serotonin was weaker the day after propofol application. Kainate elicited a significant loss of spinal neurons, especially motoneurons, whose number was halved. When propofol was applied for 4-8h after kainate washout, strong neuroprotection was observed in all spinal areas, including attenuation of motoneuron loss. Although propofol had minimal impact on recovery of electrophysiological characteristics 24h later, it did not further depress network activity. A significant improvement in disinhibited burst periodicity suggested potential to ameliorate neuronal excitability in analogy to histological data. Functional recovery of locomotor networks perhaps required longer time due to the combined action of excitotoxicity and anaesthetic depression at 24h. These results suggest propofol could confer good neuroprotection to spinal circuits during experimental SCI."

Recordings taken before placing the neural tissue at risk were assessed for variability in amplitude and latency. The lower limit in amplitude was approximately one-third (25-43%) of the baseline, The latencies were more difficult to monitor than were the amplitudes. The latency variations were 2.56 +/- 0.50 milliseconds for the hand and 6.84 +/- 1.37 milliseconds for the leg. During surgery, the unilateral recordings of two patients were transiently lost but partially recovered after a pause in the operation. No obvious postoperative weaknesses in the corresponding limbs occurred. One patient, who showed a permanent loss of unilateral recording, had transient monoplegia with a complete recovery. None of the remaining five patients who had amplitudes larger than one-third of the baseline at the end of the operation had additional motor deficits. Our conclusions are that under etomidate anesthesia, the magnetic motor evoked potentials can be convenient and reliable monitors of motor function, that changes in the amplitude may be superior to those in the latency for intraoperative warning, that the criterion for potential neural damage under magnetic motor evoked potential monitoring might be an amplitude reduction of two-thirds of the control value, and that the magnetic stimulation seems to be more sensitive than the electrical stimulation in the monitoring of motor function and also allows more time and opportunities for the motor function to recover."

Muscle relaxants diminish the amplitude of MEP because MEP is the picture of electromyogram. In 5 cases undergoing MEP monitoring, we examined the effect of rocuronium followed by the administration of sugammadex on MEP Anesthesia was induced with propofol (target controlled infusion 3.0-3.5 microg x ml(-1)) and remifentanil 0.15-0.3 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), and the trachea was intubated with the use of rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1) without any muscle rigidity, bucking and laryngospasm. General anesthesia was maintained by total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and remifentanil with no muscle relaxants. Immediately after the tracheal intubation, sugammadex 4 mg x kg(-1) was intravenously given. The amplitude of MEP was measured just before the administration of rocuronium, immediately after the tracheal intubation, and 1, 2, 3, 5 min following the administration of sugammadex. Sugammadex restored the MEP amplitude, deteriorated by rocuronium, in 3 to 5 min to the level of non-paralytic muscles. In one case, it took 8 min to restore the MEP of hemiparetic leg. Taking these findings into consideration, it is likely that rocuronium might not affect the MEP when reversed by sugammadex, and should be safe for smooth tracheal intubation in patients who need MEP monitoring."

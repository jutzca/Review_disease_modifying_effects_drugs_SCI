These inflammatory responses spread the damage to the neural cells and impair the recovery of neurological functions. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin and a simvastatin-ezetimibe combination therapy in managing the endothelial inflammatory response in an SCI rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were group-housed and SCI was induced by using the modified weight-drop method. The animals were divided into 4 groups: (1) sham group, laminectomy only (n=6); (2) no-treatment group, SCI without therapy (n=8); (3) simvastatin group (n=8), and (4) ezetimibe and simvastatin combination therapy group (n=8). A high dose (15 mg/kg) of simvastatin was given to the simvastatin group, and 10 mg/kg simvastatin and 10 mg/kg ezetimibe were given to the combination group. Neurological function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale score. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level was used as an SCI biomarker. ICAM-1 level was the highest at 72 hours after SCI in the no-treament group. The treatment groups showed significant reduction in ICAM-1 levels at 72 hours. The treatment groups, especially the combination treatment group, showed better neurological function scores. Simvastatin and simvastatin- ezetimibe all could improve the neurological function and attenuate the endothelial inflammatory response after spinal cord injury in rat."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying these effects remains unknown. This study demonstrates that the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin (Simv) exhibits neuroprotective effects on neuronal apoptosis and supports functional recovery in a rat SCI model by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In specific, Simv administration after SCI significantly up-regulated the expression of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 phosphorylation and β-catenin protein, increased the mRNA expression of lymphoid enhancer factor-1 and T-cell factor-1, and suppressed the expression of β-catenin phosphorylation in the spinal cord neurons. Simv enhanced motor neuronal survival in the spinal cord anterior horn and decreased the lesion of spinal cord tissues after SCI. Simv administration after SCI also evidently reduced the expression levels of Bax, active caspase-3, and active caspase-9 in the spinal cord neurons and the proportion of transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive neuron cells, but increased the expression level of Bcl-2 in the spinal cord neurons. However, the anti-apoptotic effects of Simv were reduced in cultured spinal cord nerve cells when the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed in the lipopolysaccharide-induced model. Furthermore, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores indicated that Simv treatment significantly improved the locomotor functions of rats after SCI. This study is the first to report that Simv exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuronal apoptosis, and promoting functional and pathological recovery after SCI by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We verified the neuroprotective properties associated with simvastatin following spinal cord injury (SCI). Simvastatin reduced neuronal apoptosis, improved the functional and pathological recovery via activating Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway, however, the anti-apoptosis effects of simvastatin were reversed following suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in primary spinal cord neurons. The significant findings may provide clinical therapeutic value of simvastatin for treating SCI."

Green fluorescence protein labeled-bone marrow stromal cells (GFP-BMSCs) were transplanted into rats through the tail vein for stem cell tracing. Twenty-four hours after transplantation, spinal cord injury (SCI) was produced using weight-drop method (10g 4cm) at the T10 level. Simvastatin (5mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by subarachnoid injection at lumbar level 4 after SCI. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed in the 4 weeks following surgery using the open-field test and inclined-plane test. At the end of the study, MRI was used to evaluate the reparation of the injured spinal cord. Animals were then euthanized, histological evaluation was used to measure lesion cavity volumes. Immunofluorescence for GFP and cell lineage markers (NeuN and GFAP) was used to evaluate simvastatin-mediated mobilization and differentiation of transplanted BMSCs. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor recovery, less signal abnormality in MRI and a smaller cavity volume compared to the control group. Immunofluorescence revealed that simvastatin increased the number of GFP-positive cells in the injured spinal cord, and the number of cells double positive for GFP/NeuN or GFP/GFAP was larger in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed higher expression of BDNF and VEGF in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. In conclusion, simvastatin can help to repair spinal cord injury in rat, where the underlying mechanism appears to involve the mobilization of bone marrow stromal cells to the injured area and higher expression of BNDF and VEGF."

Spinal cord injury was induced in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats after laminectomy at T9-T10. Then additionally with sham group (laminectomy only) the SCI animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: vehicle-treated group; 5-mg/kg simvastatin-treated group; and 10-mg/kg simvastatin-treated group. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after SCI and then daily for 5 weeks. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed during 8 weeks postoperation by performing open-field locomotor test and inclined-plane test. At the end of study, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were assessed to evaluate the integrity of spinal cord pathways. Then, the animals were killed, and 1-cm segments of spinal cord encompassing the injury site were removed for histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the spinal cord. Results show that the simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor function recovery, better electrophysiological outcome, less myelin loss, and higher expression of BDNF and GDNF. These findings suggest that simvastatin treatment starting 1 day after SCI can significantly improve locomotor recovery, and this neuroprotective effect may be related to the upregulation of BDNF and GDNF. Therefore, simvastatin may be useful as a promising therapeutic agent for SCI."

Simvastatin is one of many hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors prescribed to lower cholesterol. These drugs are also known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, improve endothelial function, and modulate the immune system in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and SCI. As both drugs have translational potential, we evaluated their neuroprotective properties here in a clinically relevant model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical contusion SCI at C5 and were randomized to receive: 1. Minocycline 90 mg/kg x 3 days, 2. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days, 3. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days then 5mg/kg x 35 days, or 4. Saline (Control). Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, modified Montoya staircase test and grooming test. Forepaw sensitivity was also assessed using the electronic von Frey Aesthesiometer. The corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts were traced and the spinal cords were harvested 7 weeks after injury. The extent of gray matter and white matter sparing and corticospinal and rubrospinal tract sprouting were evaluated in cross sections of the spinal cord. In the end, neither minocycline nor simvastatin treatment was associated with improved performance on the behavioral tests, as compared to saline controls. Performance on the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, and von Frey sensory test were similar among all groups. Animals treated for 42 days with simvastatin scored significantly higher in the grooming score compared to other groups, but retrieved significantly fewer pellets on the modified Montoya staircase test than control and minocycline treated animals. Histologically, there were no significant differences in white and gray matter sparing and in the extent of corticospinal and rubrospinal sprouting between the four groups. In conclusion, both minocycline and simvastatin failed to improve functional and histological recovery in our model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury."

These secondary events not only compromise quality of life but also delay overall recovery from SCI pathophysiology. Furthermore, in experimental models the effects of SCI therapy on bladder and renal functions are generally not evaluated. In this study, we tested whether simvastatin improves bladder and renal functions in a rat model of experimental SCI. SCI was induced by controlled contusion of T9-T10 in adult female rats. Simvastatin (5 mg/Kg body weight) was administered at two hours after SCI and repeated every 24 hours until the end point. Simvastatin-treated SCI animals (simvastatin group) were compared with vehicle-treated SCI animals (vehicle group) in terms of the Basso Beattie Bresnahan score, tissue morphology, cell death, and bladder/renal functions. The urinary bladder of vehicle animals showed a 4.3-fold increase in size and a 9-fold increase in wet weight compared to sham animals. Following SCI, the urine to plasma osmolality ratio increased initially but decreased 1 week after SCI. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of bladder tissue showed transitional epithelial hyperplasia, degeneration of lamina propria, and enlargement of tunica adventia in addition to detrusor muscle hypertrophy. Rats treated with simvastatin for 14 days displayed remarkable recovery by showing decreased bladder size and maintenance of a normal urine/plasma osmolality ratio, in addition to improved locomotion. The muscularis layer of the bladder also regained its compact nature in simvastatin animals. Moreover, SCI-induced renal caspase-3 activity was significantly decreased in the simvastatin group indicating the ability of simvastatin to reduce the renal tubular apoptosis. Post-injury administration of simvastatin ameliorates bladder and renal dysfunction associated with SCI in rats."

In the present study, we show that statins decrease acute astrocyte activation in CNS injury, and decrease chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) levels in astrocyte cultures as well as CNS injury. CSPG levels decreased by up to 45% in simvastatin-treated astrocyte cultures compared to control cultures. In simvastatin-treated animals, CSPG levels declined by 60% 8 days after brain stab injury, and by 62-64% 4 weeks after spinal cord injury (SCI). Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) levels decreased in brain stab at 8 days after surgery/intervention, suggesting that statins produce a decrease in astrocyte activation. Attenuation of astrocyte activation may contribute to the decline in CSPG levels. However, there are likely other contributing factors, since GFAP levels were not a contributing factor in the decline of CSPG levels in astrocyte cultures. Robust locomotor improvements were not observed with any treatment. The numerous beneficial effects of statins on CNS injury render them an attractive candidate in the treatment of CNS injury."

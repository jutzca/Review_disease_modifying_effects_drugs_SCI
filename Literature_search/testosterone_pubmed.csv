Patients with SCI usually exhibit severe clinical symptoms, including sensory and motor dysfunction below the injured levels, paraplegia, quadriplegia and urinary retention, which can exacerbate the substantial medical and social burdens. The major pathological change observed in SCI is inflammatory reaction, which induces demyelination, axonal degeneration, and the apoptosis and necrosis of neurons. Traditional medical treatments are mainly focused on the recovery of motor function and prevention of complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of SCI and have proposed lots of effective treatments, but the clinical applications are still limited due to the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis after SCI. Endocrine hormones are kinds of molecules that are synthesized by specialized endocrine organs and can participate in the regulation of multiple physiological activities, and their protective effects on several disorders have been widely discussed. In addition, many studies have identified that endocrine hormones can promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery in individuals with central nervous system diseases. Therefore, studies investigating the clinical applications of endocrine hormones as treatments for SCI are necessary. In this review, we described the neuroprotective roles of several endocrine hormones in SCI; endocrine hormone administration reduces cell death and promotes functional repair after SCI. We also proposed novel therapies for SCI."

Inclusion of both sexes when modeling neurotrauma is leading to the identification of novel areas for therapeutic and scientific exploitation. Here, we review the organizational and activational effects of sex hormones on recovery from injury and how these changes impact the long-term health of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. When determining how sex affects SCI it remains imperative to expand outcomes beyond locomotor recovery and consider other complications plaguing the quality of life of patients with SCI. Interestingly, the SCI field predominately utilizes female rodents for basic science research which contrasts most other male-biased research fields. We discuss the unique caveats this creates to the translatability of preclinical research in the SCI field. We also review current clinical and preclinical data examining sex as biological variable in SCI. Further, we report how technical considerations such as housing, size, care management, and age, confound the interpretation of sex-specific effects in animal studies of SCI. We have uncovered novel findings regarding how age differentially affects mortality and injury-induced anemia in males and females after SCI, and further identified estrus cycle dysfunction in mice after injury. Emerging concepts underlying sexually dimorphic responses to therapy are also discussed. Through a combination of literature review and primary research observations we present a practical guide for considering and incorporating sex as biological variable in preclinical neurotrauma studies."

In Study 1, TM (40 min/day, 5 days/week, beginning 1 week postsurgery) did not prevent SCI-induced hindlimb cancellous bone loss after 3 weeks. In Study 2, TM did not attenuate SCI-induced plantar flexor muscles atrophy nor improve locomotor recovery after 4 weeks. In our main study, SCI produced extensive distal femur and proximal tibia cancellous bone deficits, a deleterious slow-to-fast fiber-type transition in soleus, lower muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), impaired muscle force production, and levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle atrophy after 8 weeks. TE alone (7.0 mg/week) suppressed bone resorption, attenuated cancellous bone loss, constrained the soleus fiber-type transition, and prevented LABC atrophy. In comparison, TE+TM concomitantly suppressed bone resorption and stimulated bone formation after SCI, produced near-complete cancellous bone preservation, prevented the soleus fiber-type transition, attenuated soleus fCSA atrophy, maintained soleus force production, and increased LABC mass. 75% of SCI+TE+TM animals recovered voluntary over-ground hindlimb stepping, while no SCI and only 20% of SCI+TE animals regained stepping ability. Positive associations between testosterone and locomotor function suggest that TE influenced locomotor recovery. In conclusion, short-term TM alone did not improve bone, muscle, or locomotor recovery in adult rats after severe SCI, while longer-term TE+TM provided more comprehensive musculoskeletal benefit than TE alone."

This study aims to examine the effect of daily 60-minute locomotor training and exercise in general on sexual function in a rat SCI contusion model. Male Wistar rats received a T9 contusion SCI. Animals were randomized into 4 groups: a quadrupedal stepping group (SCI + QT), a forelimb-only exercise group (SCI + FT), a non-trained harnessed group (SCI + NT), and a home cage non-trained group (SCI + HC). The 2 non-trained groups were combined (SCI) post hoc. Daily training sessions were 60 minutes in duration for 8 weeks. Urine samples were collected during bi-weekly 24-hour metabolic cage behavioral testing. Latency, numbers of penile dorsiflexion, and glans cupping were recorded during bi-weekly penile dorsiflexion reflex (PDFR) testing. Terminal electromyography (EMG) recordings of the bulbospongiosus muscle (BSM) were recorded in response to stimulation of the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP). ABT after SCI had a significant effect on PDFR, as well as BSM EMG latency and burst duration. SCI causes a significant decrease in the latency to onset of PDFR. After 8 weeks of ABT, SCI + QT animals had a significantly increased latency relative to the post-SCI baseline. BSM EMG response to DNP stimulation had a significantly decreased latency and increase in average and maximum amplitude in SCI + QT animals. SCI animals had a significantly longer burst duration than trained animals. Time between PDFR events, penile dorsiflexion, glans cupping, and urine testosterone were not affected by ABT. ABT has a positive influence on sexual function and provides a potential therapy to enhance the efficacy of current sexual dysfunction therapies in the male SCI population. Several significant small improvements in sexual function were found in a clinically relevant rat model of SCI using a readily available rehabilitative therapy. The limited findings could reflect insensitivity of the PDFR as a measure of erectile function. These results indicate that task-specific stepping and/or loading provide sensory input to the spinal cord impacting the neural circuitry responsible for sexual function.

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone."

We previously demonstrated that motoneurons and the muscles they innervate show pronounced atrophy after SCI, and these changes are prevented by treatment with testosterone. Here, we assessed whether the testosterone active metabolites estradiol and dihydrotestosterone have similar protective effects after SCI. Young adult female rats received either sham or T9 spinal cord contusion injuries and were treated with estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, both, or nothing via Silastic capsules. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor testing was performed weekly and voiding behavior was assessed at 3 weeks post-injury. Four weeks after SCI, lesion volume and tissue sparing, quadriceps muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and motoneuron dendritic morphology were assessed. Spontaneous locomotor behavior improved after SCI, but hormone treatments had no effect. Voiding behavior was disrupted after SCI, but was significantly improved by treatment with either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone; combined treatment was maximally effective. Treatment with estradiol reduced lesion volume, but dihydrotestosterone alone and estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone were ineffective. SCI-induced decreases in motoneuron dendritic length were attenuated by all hormone treatments. SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were prevented by treatment with either dihydrotestosterone or estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone, but estradiol treatment was ineffective. These findings suggest that deficits in micturition and regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology seen after SCI are ameliorated by treatment with estradiol or dihydrotestosterone, further supporting a role for steroid hormones as neurotherapeutic agents in the injured nervous system."

Treatment options are limited, and recovery is often incomplete. Treadmill exercise can enhance nerve regeneration; however, this appears to occur in a sex-dependent manner. Females respond best to short duration, high speed interval training; whereas, males respond best to slower, continuous training. Previous studies have shown a role for testosterone in this process, but the role of estrogen is unknown. To evaluate the role of estrogen signaling in treadmill exercise, we blocked estrogen receptor (ER) signaling during treadmill exercise in males and female wild type mice. The right common fibular (CF) branch of the sciatic nerve was cut and repaired with fibrin glue that contained the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Estradiol-filled or blank Silastic capsules were implanted subcutaneously at the time of nerve transection. Starting three days post-transection, exercised mice received treadmill training using the paradigm appropriate to their sex 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Fourteen days after the initial nerve transection, motoneurons whose axons had regenerated at least 1.5 mm distal to the original cut sites were labeled with a retrograde tracer. Regeneration was quantified by counting the number of fluorescent labeled motoneurons in the lumbar region of the spinal cord. Both treadmill training and estradiol administration increased the number of motoneurons participating in axon regeneration, but these effects were blocked by ER antagonist treatment.

At each time point, fine needle aspiration biopsy samples were taken from the testes for cytological assessment, and serum levels of relevant hormones were measured.

Males with SCI tend to be injured at an earlier age, mostly during sports or motor vehicle accidents, whereas females tend be injured later in life, particularly in the age group 65 and older. In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females. Similar controversy exists clinically, in studies that have examined gender disparities in outcome after SCI. The current review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for a gender bias in outcome following SCI and discusses issues that have made it difficult to conclusively answer this question."

Although, to date, definitive gold-standard clinical trials are lacking, what has made this provocative argument even more convincing is the longstanding, documented safety of intravenous estrogen for various illnesses and conditions as well as the relative ease and inexpensive cost of treatment. As such, even routine prehospital administration becomes extremely feasible for a myriad of conditions. More importantly, the worldwide magnitude of potential patients who could benefit is profound. Even if estrogen only changes the outcome in a relatively small percentage of applicable cases, the potential impact may still be of dramatic proportions in terms of the absolute number of lives saved and the resources spared worldwide. Resources may be spared not only in terms of diminishing the economic impact of death and long-term disability, but also in terms of preventing extended intensive care unit stays and treatment of preventable complications that result in longer recovery."

We depleted SNB motoneurons on one side only of the spinal cord by unilateral intramuscular injection of a retrogradely transported form of saporin, and examined the morphology of contralateral SNB motoneurons. Motoneuron morphology was assessed in normal control males, gonadally intact saporin-treated males, and saporin-treated males who had been castrated 6 weeks previously and given testosterone replacement beginning at the time of saporin injection. Untreated castrated males served as an additional control group. Four weeks after saporin treatment, SNB motoneurons contralateral to the saporin injection were retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the cholera toxin B subunit and reconstructed in three dimensions. In gonadally intact males, unilateral motoneuron depletion caused regressive changes in contralateral SNB motoneurons: Soma size and dendritic length were both decreased. However, testosterone manipulation (i.e., castration followed by testosterone replacement) completely prevented the dendritic retraction. These data suggest a therapeutic role for testosterone in preventing, or accelerating recovery from, dendritic atrophy induced by motoneuron injury."

In this study, we extended those studies to another injury model and asked the following question: Will T treatment accelerate recovery from lower limb paralysis following sciatic nerve crush in the rat? METHODS: Castrated adult male rats received a right side sciatic nerve crush at the level of the sciatic notch, with the left side serving as control. Half the animals received a subcutaneous implant of a propionated form of T (TP), the others were sham-implanted. Weekly testing using the Sciatic Functional Index (SFI), a quantitative measure of locomotion, was done for 7 weeks postoperative (wpo). RESULTS: Between 3 and 5 weeks post-op, the average SFI score of the TP-treated group was higher than controls. This difference was significant at 4 wpo, indicating an accelerated degree of functional recovery. At these timepoints, the differences were attributable to the footprint or paw length and associated with calf muscle reinnervation rather than the toespreading component associated with intrinsic foot muscle rein-nervation. Beyond 5 wpo, there were no differences in the SFI scores. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that, as with facial nerve regeneration in the hamster, testosterone accelerates functional recovery from hind limb paralysis following sciatic nerve injury in the rat. While the responses of spinal motoneurons to injury can differ from those of cranial motoneurons, in this case it appears that they share a similar response to the trophic actions of androgen. This is important in the context of designing therapeutic strategies for dealing with direct trauma to motoneurons resulting from both peripheral and central nervous system trauma, such as spinal cord injury."

This sexual dimorphism is wiped out and recovery is worse in adult mice deprived of mature T cells. After spinal cord contusion in adult rats, functional recovery (measured by locomotor scores in an open field) was significantly worse in females treated with dihydrotestosterone prior to the injury than in placebo-treated controls, and significantly better in castrated males than in their noncastrated male littermates. Post-traumatic administration of the testosterone receptor antagonist flutamide promoted the functional recovery in adult male rats. These results, in line with the known inhibitory effect of testosterone on cell-mediated immunity, suggest that androgen-mediated immunosuppression plays a role in ISCI-related immune dysfunction and can therefore partly explain the worse outcome of ISCI in males than in female. We suggest that females, which are more prone to develop autoimmune response than males, benefit from this response in cases of CNS insults."

Results of this study reveal that while serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone levels in SCI rats recovered within 1 month after the injury, their spermatogenesis continued to regress. By 3 months, spermatogenesis in 70% of SCI rats has totally regressed, characterized by the absence of proliferating spermatogonia; these effects could not be prevented by an otherwise effective regimen of testosterone treatment. Sertoli cells in the regressed seminiferous tubules exhibited unusual behavior, characterized by the formation of multiple cell layers and/or aggregates that extended into the tubular lumen. Active spermatogenesis was observed in nine of the 19 SCI rats by 6 months, seven of which had complete spermatogenesis, but with persisting abnormalities. These results demonstrate that SCI results in total, but reversible, regression of spermatogenesis. Failure to prevent such effects by an otherwise effective exogenous testosterone regimen suggests that non-endocrine factors are involved in the SCI effects on spermatogenesis. The unusual Sertoli cell localization in the regressed testes may have been triggered by the loss of proliferating spermatogonia and may be involved in subsequent spermatogenic recovery."

This observation suggests that growth, and possibly function, of the prostate may be compromised after SCI. To explore this possibility, we examined the effects of SCI on the androgen-related biochemical properties and morphology of the prostate in the rat at various times after surgically induced SCI. SCI resulted in an acute decrease in prostate weight and an increase in steady state level of mRNA for testosterone-repressed prostate message 2 (TRPM 2) during the first 2 weeks postinjury. These changes perhaps relate to an increase in cell death or a decrease in secretory activity due to an acute suppression of serum testosterone after the injury. Concomitantly, there was a transient, but significant, decrease in the steady state level of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA in the prostate during the first 2 weeks after SCI, an indication of an altered autoregulation of AR by its own ligand. Despite the fact that growth of the prostate, as indicated by weight increase, in SCI rats resumed 2 weeks postinjury, prostate weights were persistently lower in SCI rats than sham-operated controls for at least 3 months. Furthermore, prostate TRPM 2 mRNA levels remained elevated throughout the recovery period even after a normal prostate weight had been restored. In addition, a decrease in the height of ventral prostate epithelial cells was noted in SCI rats 28 and 90 days postinjury. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of SCI on prostate function. These findings and our unreported observation of persistently smaller seminal vesicles in the same groups of SCI rats suggest that functions of male accessory sex glands may also be compromised after SCI. These changes may affect biochemical properties of the secretory products of these glands and may provide some explanation for the reported changes in the composition of the seminal plasma and abnormal sperm motility seen in the semen of SCI men."

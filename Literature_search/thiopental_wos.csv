Six adult minipigs weighing 32-35 kg were narcotized by thiopental, intubated, and placed on a volume-cycled ventilator. Anaesthesia was maintained by 1.5% sevoflurane with oxygen. Following location of the 1st lumbar vertebra animals were fastened in an immobilization frame. The spinal cord, exposed through a laminectomy, was compressed by a 5 mm thick circular rod with a peak force of 0.8 kg at a velocity of 3 cm.s(-1). The next day the minipigs were paraplegic but improved rapidly to paraparesis. On the 12th postoperative day they were euthanasied. Neural tissue changes were evaluated by post mortem MRI, which showed damage to the spinal cord white and/or gray matter in the epicentre of compression with longitudinal spreading over one segment cranially and caudally. Statistical analyses performed by Spearman's rho test revealed positive correlations between damaged areas and the whole area of the spinal cord white/gray matter (P = 0.047; r(s) = 0.742) and (P = 0.002; r(s) = 0.943), respectively. The study confirmed the reliability and reproducibility of the utilised model of spinal cord trauma. The structural changes in the epicentre of injury did not impede the rapid but incomplete recovery of motor functions."

The antioxidative capacity of the drug exceeded that of barbiturates more than 100-fold. Stobadine was also shown to inhibit the increase in formation of TBA-RS in homogenates of rabbit spinal cord, subjected to 20 min ischaemia, to the level comparable with controls. Administration of the drug (6 mg kg-1) to animals 5 min before 20 min ischaemia had no effect on level of lipid peroxidation products in the spinal cord; however, it slowed down stimulated Fe2+-dependent peroxidation after in vitro incubation of the homogenates and increased the concentration of phosphatidylserine and ethanolamine plasmalogens, as compared with non-treated animals. Application of stobadine 2 min before the release of an aortic occlusion increased the antiradical capacity in homogenates of spinal cord and revealed an ameliorating effect on the composition of phospholipids."

Mali Wistar rats (N = 65) weighing 180-200 g were fasted for 24 h and complete SCT a as performed between C-7 and T-1 vertebrae after a careful midline dorsal incision. GE and GI and intestinal transits were measured 15 min. 6 h or 24 h after recovery from anesthesia. A test meal (0.5 mg/ml phenol red in 5% glucose solution) nas administered intragastrically (1.5 mi) and the animals were sacrificed by an iv thiopental overdose 10 min later to evaluate GE and GI transit. For intestinal transit measurements, 1 mi of the test meal was administered into the proximal duodenum through a cannula inserted into a gastric fistula. GE was inhibited (P<0.05) by 34.3, 23.4 and 22.7%, respectively, at 15 min, 6 h and 24 h after SCT. GI transit nas inhibited (P<0.05) by 42.5, 19.8 and 18.4%, respectively, at 15 min, 6 h and 24 h after SCT. Intestinal transit was also inhibited (P<0.05) by 48.8, 47.2 and 40.1%, respectively, at 15 min. 6 h and 24 h after SCT. Mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased (P<0.05) by 48.5, 46.8 and 41.5%, respectively, at 15 min, 6 h and 24 h after SCT. In summary, our report describes a decreased GE and GI and intestinal transits in awake rats within the first 24 h after high SCT."

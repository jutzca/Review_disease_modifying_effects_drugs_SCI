Spasticity in the muscles surrounding the ankle joint caused by hypertonia is often reported as a complication. We investigated whether a pharmacological intervention using Tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication acting as an α2-adrenergic agonist, could lead to improvements in walking endurance. We placed subjects on a 4-week program and measured the change in clinical measures of walking speed, endurance, and mobility. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to class subjects into groups based on recovery patterns. Two classes of recovery were found by GMM: high and low functioning. Radom coefficient regression (RCR) was then used to identify significant changes over time. Statistically significant improvements in walking endurance were shown for the high functioning group. However, a small number of subjects in the high functioning group showed improvement greater than the smallest real difference (SRD), which indicates a clinical significance as well. We also investigated the extent to which these recovery patterns can be predicted using baseline measures. Baseline walking endurance was found to be a robust predictor of recovery in walking endurance. Subjects that began the intervention with already higher endurance showed a greater chance of improvement in endurance over time. This information could potentially be used as a fast and reliable assessment tool for clinicians to predict which patient can benefit the most from this intervention prior to prescribing the medication, and thus optimizing cost and resources. Our findings demonstrate that these techniques can be used to characterize and predict the progress of changes to functional impairments due to various types of intervention."

Various interventions have been trialed to improve function and reduce spasticity after SCI, with variable results. We investigated the effects of a pharmacological (an anti-spastic medication - tizanidine) and a physical intervention (robotic-assisted locomotor training - Lokomat) on function in people with incomplete SCI over 4-week of training. The outcome measures were walking speed, endurance and mobility. Subjects were randomized into one of three groups; no intervention (control), Lokomat (Lok) and tizanidine (Tiz). To account for variability, we used growth mixture modelling (GMM) to class subjects based on their recovery patterns. GMM identified two classes of recovery: high and low function. Significant improvements were seen in walking speed and mobility in high and low functioning subjects in the Lok group, and in walking endurance in high functioning subjects in the Tiz group. However, changes with training were clinically important only for approximately 10% of subjects, who achieved a minimal important difference (MID) in functional outcomes as a result of the training. We used mixed model ANOVAs to compare the group effects. Improvements with training were seen in both classes, however no differences between interventions were found. The GMM had classed all subjects that achieved the MID as high functioning. GMM can be used to successfully class subjects; however larger subject numbers and longer interventions are required to fully utilize this technique. Our results demonstrate that both interventions have potential to improve walking capacity, but more intense training for a longer period may need to achieve MID."

Different interventions have been trialed with variable results. We investigated the effects of pharmacological and physical (locomotor training) interventions on function in people living with incomplete motor function loss caused by SCI and used different analytical techniques to understand whether functional levels affect recovery with different interventions. Participants with an incomplete SCI were assigned to 3 groups: no intervention, Lokomat, or tizanidine. Outcome measures were the 10-m walk test, 6-minute walk test, and the Timed Up and Go. Participants were classified in 2 ways: (1) based on achieving an improvement above the minimally important difference (MID) and (2) using growth mixture modeling (GMM). Functional levels of participants who achieved the MID were compared and random coefficient regression (RCR) was used to assess recovery in GMM classes. Overall, walking speed and endurance improved, with no difference between interventions. Only a small number of participants achieved the MID. Both MID and GMM-RCR analyses revealed that tizanidine improved endurance in high-functioning participants. GMM-RCR classification also showed that speed and mobility improved after locomotor training. Improvements in function were achieved in a limited number of people with SCI. Using the MID and GMM techniques, differences in responses to interventions between high-and low-functioning participants could be identified. These techniques may, therefore, have potential to be used for characterizing therapeutic effects resulting from different interventions."

Since these measures are neither objective nor quantitative, the therapeutic effects of such medications on neuromuscular properties have not been fully evaluated. In this study, as a first attempt, we examined the effect of tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication, on modification of the neuromuscular properties of patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Each patient was administered 2 mg of tizanidine four times per day for four weeks. The spastic ankle of each patient was evaluated at baseline (prior to any medication, and then 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the start of medication. The ankle was perturbed with a small-amplitude Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) perturbation at various positions over the ankle range-of-motion. A parallel-cascade system identification technique, which provides an objective and quantitative measure of neuromuscular properties, was used to calculate the intrinsic and reflex stiffness. The stiffness vs. joint angle trends were then calculated for each evaluation; these curves were compared across the intervention time to determine the recovery pattern (i.e. change over time) due to the tizanidine intervention. All patients exhibited decreases in reflex stiffness (which abnormally increase after SCI) due to the medication; however, patients were observed to exhibit multiple recovery patterns. For some patients, the reflex stiffness continuously reduced over the four-week intervention period, while for other patients, the decrease during the first week (i.e. between the baseline and 1-Week evaluations) was most pronounced. Also, some patients presented a significant decrease with time, while others presented no improvement in the intrinsic stiffness. These findings suggest that tizanidine may be effective in reducing not only reflex stiffness, but also the subject's intrinsic stiffness for certain patients. Future work remains to identify predictors which can objectively determine which patients are likely to exhibit maximal benefit from the tizanidine prior to being prescribed with the medication."

Twenty-nine SCI subjects with spastic hypertonia at their ankle participated in a 12-session Lokomat training regimen, with half receiving Lokomat only (LOKO) and half receiving Lokomat combined with tizanidine (LOKO+TIZ). Walking capacity was evaluated in terms of the 10-meter walking (10MW) speed-a major clinical evaluation of SCI rehabilitation-four times (at the baseline, 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after training). Growth Mixture Model (GMM) was used to classify the walking speed into recovery patterns. Two latent classes were found for each treatment group, corresponding to low speed and high speed. Walking speed increased with training for high-walking-capacity subjects in the LOKO group, and for both high- and low-capacity subjects in the LOKO+TIZ group. Improvement magnitude between pre- and post-test varied among latent classes. Within each class, the baseline measure had a significant effect on walking speed improvement. This study shows that the Lokomat training improves walking speed for patients with SCI, and anti-spasticity medication, such as tizanidine, can improve the efficacy of Lokomat training, particularly for patients with low walking capacity."

Subjects were evaluated 4 times for Timed-Up-and-Go, 10-Meter-Walking, and 6-Minute-Walking testings, at the baseline, 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after training. Latent Class Growth model was used to classify the LOKOMAT training speed, and clinical walking evaluations. Subjects in each treatment group could be classified into two subclasses for training speed and clinical evaluation. It was found that the training speed increased in all treatment group, while the subjects in LOKOMAT+Tizanidine presented a significant improvement of their training speed from the training session. The clinical evaluations classified subjects similarly, and no significant improvement of clinical measurements was observed for either treatment. The MVC dorsiflexion torque at the ankle joint was able to predict the class memberships of subjects for their walking capacity and can be used as a significant predictor for therapeutic functional recovery after spinal cord injury."

The Volume 30(1), 2020 of the EJTM opens with the collection of abstracts for the conference ""2020 Padua Muscle Days: Mobility Medicine 30 years of Translational Research"". This is an international conference that will be held between March 18-21, 2020 in Euganei Hills and Padova in Italy. The abstracts are excellent examples of translational research and of the multidimensional approaches that are needed to classify and manage (in both the acute and chronic phases) diseases of Mobility that span from neurologic, metabolic and traumatic syndromes to the biological process of aging. One of the typical aim of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation is indeed to reduce pain and increase mobility enough to enable impaired persons to walk freely, garden, and drive again. The excellent contents of this Collection of Abstracts reflect the high scientific caliber of researchers and clinicians who are eager to present their results at the PaduaMuscleDays. A series of EJTM Communications will also add to this preliminary evidence."

The authors hypothesized that recovery in rats after surgery could be reversed by antagonism of spinal oxytocin or vasopressin receptors, that there may be a sex difference, and that spinal oxytocin innervation could change after surgery. Male and female rats underwent partial spinal nerve ligation surgery. Effects of nonselective and selective oxytocin and vasopressin 1A receptor antagonists on mechanical hypersensitivity during partial recovery were assessed (n = 8 to 14/group). Oxytocin immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (n = 7 to 8/group) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for oxytocin-binding receptors in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord (n = 8/group) were measured. Intrathecal injection of oxytocin and vasopressin receptor antagonists were similarly effective at reducing withdrawal threshold (in all experiments from 22 [19, 26] median [first quartile, third quartile]) g to 8.3 [6.4, 12] g after injection) in both sexes, while having no or minimal effects in animals without surgery. Oxytocin fiber immunoreactivity was 3- to 5-fold greater in lumbar than other regions of the spinal cord and was increased more than 2-fold in lumbar cord ipsilateral to surgery. Injury was also associated with a 6.5-fold increase in oxytocin receptor and a 2-fold increase in vasopressin 1A receptor messenger RNA expression in the L4 dorsal root ganglion ipsilateral to surgery. These findings suggest that the capacity for oxytocin signaling in the spinal cord increases after surgery and that spinal oxytocin signaling plays ongoing roles in both sexes in recovery from mechanical hypersensitivity after surgery with known nerve injury."

One urinary complication that has received little attention is SCI-induced polyuria, even though individuals with SCI will significantly restrict their fluid intake to decrease urine production, leading to sequelae of medical complications. Understanding the mechanisms instigating the development of polyuria will allow us to target interventions that may alleviate polyuria symptoms, leading to significant improvements in the quality of life and urinary health of individuals with SCI. In a rat SCI contusion model, an increase in the amount of urine excreted over a 24-h period ( P ≤ 0.001) was found at 2 wk postinjury. The urine excreted was more dilute with decreased urinary creatinine and specific gravity ( P ≤ 0.001). Several factors important in fluid balance regulation, vasopressin (AVP), natriuretic peptides, and corticosterone (CORT), also changed significantly postinjury. AVP levels decreased ( P = 0.042), whereas atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and CORT increased ( P = 0.005 and P = 0.031, respectively) at 2 wk postinjury. There was also a positive correlation between the increase in ANP and urine volume postinjury ( P = 0.033). The changes in AVP, ANP, and CORT are conducive to producing polyuria, and the timing of these changes coincides with the development of SCI-induced polyuria. This study identifies several therapeutic targets that could be used to ameliorate polyuria symptoms and improve quality of life in individuals with SCI."

Our previous study showed that the expression of miR-126 was downregulated after spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, we wanted to examine whether upregulation of miR-126 could promote angiogenesis, inhibit inflammation, and exert a positive effect on recovery after contusion SCI. In this study, we found that increased levels of miR-126 promoted angiogenesis, and inhibited leukocyte extravasation into the injured spinal cord, which was concurrent with downregulation of mRNA and protein expression of three validated miR-126 target genes, SPRED1, PIK3R2, and VCAM1. Moreover, a dose-dependent effect of miR-126 was observed in rescuing tissue damage and improving the functional deficit after SCI. Thus, the present study indicated that miR-126 played an important role in angiogenesis and inflammation after SCI."

Our aim was to describe vasopressor usage and examine their effects in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 131 patients with SCI who received any kind of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure in the neurocritical care unit of a Level 1 trauma center (2005-2011). Vasopressor usage and complications were obtained from the medical record. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the American Spinal Injury Association score. Dopamine was the most commonly used vasopressor (48.0%), followed by phenylephrine (45.0%), norepinephrine (5.0%), epinephrine (1.5%), and vasopressin (0.5%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complications (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, troponin elevation, atrial fibrillation, heart rate >130 or <50, etc.) due to vasopressors were independently associated with the overall usages of dopamine (odds ratio [OR] 8.97; p<0.001) and phenylephrine (OR, 5.92; p=0.004), age ≥60 years old (OR, 5.16; p=0.013), and complete SCI (OR, 3.23; p=0.028). There was no difference in neurological improvement with either dopamine (OR, 1.16; p=0.788) or phenylephrine (OR 0.96; p=0.940). Incomplete SCI (OR, 2.64; p=0.019) and surgery <24 h after SCI (OR, 4.25; p=0.025) were independently associated with improved outcome. In summary, vasopressors are associated with increased complications in SCI patients. Further prospective studies are required in order to determine the potential benefits and risks of blood pressure management in patients with SCI."

Case report. A 57-year-old man with tetraparesis and protracted hyponatremia resistant to standard therapies. This patient's rehabilitation from epidural abscess-induced tetraplegia was complicated by symptomatic hyponatremia. The pathophysiology was multifactorial. The course was prolonged, and several therapeutic endeavors failed. Intravenous infusions of vasopressin receptor antagonist induced and maintained eunatremia. The pace of the patient's recovery improved, and he was discharged with substantial neurologic recovery. No central nervous system toxicities of the treatments were observed. Intravenous vasopressin receptor antagonist is an effective and safe treatment for hyponatremia in the rehabilitation setting if the dosage and monitoring protocols are modified in accordance with the physiology of the patient with spinal cord injury."

ABC immunohistochemical method and histochemical method on detection of Ca2+-dependent acid phosphatase activity were used for the morpho-functional study. By recording the electrical activity of the signals from the single neurons in and below the SC injury place, NOX venom has been shown to result in the complete restoration of hypothalamic-spinal projections originated from ipsi- and contra-lateral PVN and SON to neurons of SC lumbar part. NOX prevented the scar formation, well observed two months after SC injury in the control rats, resulted in the regeneration of nerve fibers growing through the trauma region, survival of the PRP-1- and LVV-H7-immunoreactive (Ir) neurons, and increase of the PRP-1 - and LVV-H7-Ir nerve fibers and astrocytes in the SC lesion region. NOX was suggested to exert the neuroprotective effect, involving the PRP-1 and LVV-H7 in the underlying mechanism of neuronal recovery."

Eight quadriplegic subjects with complete spinal cord transection at the C6 to C8 level and 6 age-matched healthy subjects. Cardiovascular and endocrine responses were examined during 2 minutes of control, 3 minutes of ice-water immersion of the foot, followed by a 3-minute recovery. Blood pressure, heart rate, the Borg 15-point Rating of Perceived Pain Scale, and blood samples for measurement of plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin. The rise in the mean arterial blood pressure during the cold pressor test in patients with SCI (baseline, 81.6+/-3.7mmHg; increased by 30%+/-6.1%) was significantly (P<.05) higher than that in healthy subjects (baseline, 101.2+/-4.5mmHg; increased by 20%+/-4.5%). The SCI subjects had no change in heart rate throughout the test, in contrast to the tachycardia noted in normal subjects. Baseline plasma norepinephrine in SCI subjects (63.0+/-18.3pg/mL) was significantly lower than in normal subjects (162.3+/-19.6pg/mL) and plasma norepinephrine increased significantly during the cold pressor test in both groups. In the SCI subjects, a reflex sympathetic discharge through the isolated spinal cord results in a more profound rise in mean blood pressure during ice-water immersion. This response was free of inhibitory impulses from supraspinal center and baroreceptor reflexes, either of which might restrain the increase in blood pressure."

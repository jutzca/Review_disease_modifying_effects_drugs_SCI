Surgery outcomes of 236 CSM patients were determined. Recovery rate was calculated according to Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores during follow-up. CSM patients with a recovery rate>50% were assigned with good prognosis and the rest were with fair prognosis. Preoperative and postoperative neurologic function scores were compared among groups. Plasma VDBP and 25(OH)D levels, as well as GSH levels were measured by ELISA and glutathione reductase recycling assay, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient was performed to analyze the correlation among plasma VDBP, 25(OH)D, and GSH levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to evaluate the predictive value of plasma VDBP, 25(OH)D, and GSH levels for surgical outcome. Logistic regression model was used to analyze risk factors for surgical outcome. Compared with those with fair prognosis, CSM patients with good prognosis group exhibited higher postoperative neurologic function scores, plasma VDBP, 25(OH)D, and GSH levels, and better improvements in spinal cord compression and motions of the cervical vertebra. Plasma VDBP, 25(OH)D, and GSH levels were favorable prognostic factors for CSM surgical outcome. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma VDBP, plasma 25(OH)D, and plasma GSH were 89.8% and 91.7%, 85.8% and 84.4%, and 79.5% and 91.7%, respectively. Our study provides evidence that higher plasma VDBP, 25(OH)D, and GSH levels may predict better surgical outcome in CSM patients."

Calcitriol-treated group had significantly improved outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control, which was confirmed by increased ventral horn motor neurons in Calcitriol-treated group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that calcitriol injection has a significant regulatory effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to control SCI groups, which was associated with significant reduction in IFN-gamma and IL-17A secretion and leukocyte infiltration into injury site. Along with confirmation of immunoregulatory aspects of Calcitriol treatment against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that reducing the extent of progressive tissue loss by Calcitriol therapy in acute phase, could result in better recovery after SCI."

Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of up- and downregulated DEGs was performed. Additionally, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed and the expression patterns of different genes were determined. Compared with sham samples, there were 374, 707, 1,322, 1,475, 1,724 and 1,342 DEGs identified at 0.5, 4, 24 and 72 h, and 7 and 28 days post-injury, respectively. At 24 and 72 h, and 7 days following injury, the upregulated DEGs were markedly enriched in inflammatory response' and immune process'. Downregulated DEGs were predominantly enriched in neuronal function-associated pathways and steroid biosynthesis' process. Protein-protein interaction network analysis demonstrated similar results. Trend charts further demonstrated that the inflammatory and neuronal functions were altered in a temporal and site-specific manner. The present study provided an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying traumatic SCI, which may benefit future SCI research and aid in therapy development."

In order to confirm the restorative potential of vitamin D, we performed a new study, using a rat model of left cervical hemisection (C-2). From Day 1 or Day 7, animals received, during three months, a weekly oral bolus of either cholecalciferol, at the dose of 500 IU/kg/day, or vehicle, namely triglycerides. Rats were assessed every month, using a ladder test for sensori-locomotor ability and neuromuscular capacity. Three months after injury, H-reflex was recorded from left extensor digitorum muscle in order to measure the reflexivity of the sub-lesional region. Ventilatory frequency was also monitored during an electrically induced muscle fatigue of the hindlimb known to enhance muscle metaboreflex and increase respiratory rate. After recording the phrenic nerve activity, ipsilateral to the lesion, during spontaneous breathing, animals were artificially ventilated while paralyzed with a neuromuscular blocking agent and then the brainstem respiratory centres were provoked to maximal output by temporarily stopping the ventilator. Spinal cords were immunostained with an anti-neurofilament antibody to evaluate axon numbers. We show here that vitamin D-treated animals display i) an enhanced locomotor activity, ii) an improved breathing when hindlimb muscle was electrically stimulated to induce fatigue, iii) an H-reflex depression similar to control animals, iv) a phrenic nerve activity response to a temporary asphyxial stress and v) a non significant decreased number of axons in the proximal stump when compared with the Sham group. This new set of data confirms that vitamin D is a potent molecule that could be tested in clinical trials assessing functional recovery in para-/tetra-plegic patients, shortly after a trauma.

Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D (VD) has neuroprotective actions and can promote function recovery after TBI. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that autophagy could be enhanced following supplementation with an active metabolite of VD (calcitriol). However, it is unclear whether autophagy participates in the protective effects of calcitriol after TBI. To test this hypothesis, we examined the protective effects of calcitriol on TBI-induced neurological impairment and further investigated whether calcitriol could modulate autophagy dysfunction-mediated cell death in the cortex region of rat brain. Methods: Eighty-five male rats (250-280 g) were randomly assigned to sham (n = 15), TBI model (TBI, n = 35) and calcitriol treatment (calcitriol, n = 35) groups. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with calcitriol (1 mu g/kg) at 30 min, 24 h and 48 h post-TBI in the calcitriol group. The lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), was used to evaluate autophagic flux in the TBI and calcitriol groups. Neurological functions were evaluated via the modified neurological severity score test at 1-7 days after TBI or sham operation, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated FITC-dUTP nick-end labeling method was used to evaluate the ability of calcitriol to inhibit apoptosis. The expression of VDR, LC3 and p62 proteins was measured by western blot analysis at 1, 3 and 7 days post-injury. Results: Calcitriol treatment attenuated mNSS at 2-7 days post-TBI (P < 0.05 versus TBI group). Calcitriol dramatically increased VDR protein expression compared with the untreated counterparts at 1, 3 and 7 days post-TBI (P < 0.05). The rate of apoptotic cells in calcitriol-treated rats was significantly reduced compared to that observed in the TBI group (P < 0.05). The LC3II/LC3I ratio was decreased in the cortex region at 1, 3 and 7 days post-TBI in rats treated with calcitriol (p < 0.05 versus TBI group), and the p62 expression was also attenuated (p < 0.05 versus TBI group). The LC3II/LC3I ratio in the calcitriol group was significantly increased when pretreated with CQ (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Calcitriol treatment activated VDR protein expression and attenuated neurological deficits in this rat TBI model. The protective effects might be associated with the restoration of autophagy flux and the decrease in apoptosis in the cortex region of rat brain. (C) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

We therefore compared serum biochemical indices of bone and calcium metabolism in 20 elderly subjects with hip fracture with those measured in 20 healthy age-matched controls. Rankin scores, a measure of functional dependence with 0 representing independence and 5 representing total dependence, were assigned. We also examined serial changes in these biochemical indices from shortly following the fracture to the early recovery period. Ionized calcium, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), intact bone Gla protein (BGP), pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-[OH](2)D) were measured. One week after the fracture, mean serum concentrations of calcium and ICTP were elevated in correspondence to degree of immobilization (mean Rankin score; 4.4), while serum concentrations of BGP, PTH, 25-OHD, and 1,25-[OH](2)D were depressed. Rankin score (mean: 4.4) correlated positively with ICTP and negatively with BGP at this time. At 2 months, calcium and ICTP elevation decreased and BGP, PTH and 1,25-[OH](2)D were less depressed, coinciding with a decline in Rankin score from 4.2 to 2.2. Indices were further improved at 3 months (mean Rankin score, 1.3), with calcium and BGP returning to normal. We concluded that increased bone resorption, and decreased bone formation, and hypercalcemia are present by 1 week following the hip fracture, and some resorption increase persists for at least 3 months. These changes could explain in part the high risk of another hip fracture."

However, before bringing this molecule to the clinic, it was of prime importance i) to assess which form - ergocalciferol versus cholecalciferol - and which dose were the most efficient and ii) to identify the molecular pathways activated by this pleiotropic molecule. The rat left peroneal nerve was cut out on a length of 10 mm and autografted in an inverted position. Animals were treated with either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, at the dose of 100 or 500 IU/kg/day, or excipient (Vehicle), and compared to unlesioned rats (Control). Functional recovery of hindlimb was measured weekly, during 12 weeks, using the peroneal functional index. Ventilatory, motor and sensitive responses of the regenerated axons were recorded and histological analysis was performed. In parallel, to identify the genes regulated by vitamin D in dorsal root ganglia and/or Schwann cells, we performed an in vitro transcriptome study. We observed that cholecalciferol is more efficient than ergocalciferol and, when delivered at a high dose (500 IU/kg/day), cholecalciferol induces a significant locomotor and electrophysiological recovery. We also demonstrated that cholecalciferol increases i) the number of preserved or newly formed axons in the proximal end, ii) the mean axon diameter in the distal end, and iii) neurite myelination in both distal and proximal ends. Finally, we found a modified expression of several genes involved in axogenesis and myelination, after 24 hours of vitamin supplementation. Our study is the first to demonstrate that vitamin D acts on myelination via the activation of several myelin-associated genes. It paves the way for future randomised controlled clinical trials for peripheral nerve or spinal cord repair."

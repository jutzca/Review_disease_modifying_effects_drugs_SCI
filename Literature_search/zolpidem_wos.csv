Structural or functional injuries may produce impairments in the neuronal circuits (the ascending reticular activating system and thalamocortical loops) responsible for maintaining the wakefulness state and awareness, associated with a change in neurotransmitter concentrations. Pharmacological agents that are able to restore the levels of neurotransmitters and, consequently, neural synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity of consciousness networks, may play an important role as drugs useful in improving the consciousness state. Currently, there is growing interest in the scientific community with regard to pharmacological agents that act on the gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) system, such as zolpidem and baclofen, and monoamine systems, such as dopaminergic agents and some antidepressants. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of these potential 'awakening' drugs in patients with disorders of consciousness. The possible mechanisms by which these drugs may exert their effects in promoting recovery of consciousness are discussed, highlighting how many findings are often the result of sporadic events rather than prospective controlled trials or implementation of standard treatment guidelines."

The scarcity of treatment options is challenged by new clinical and neuroimaging data indicating that some patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness might benefit from therapeutic interventions, even years after the injury. Most studies of interventions aimed at improving patients' level of consciousness and functional recovery were behavioural and brain imaging open-label trials and case reports, but several randomised controlled trials have been done, particularly focused on the effects of drugs or use of non-invasive brain stimulation. However, only two studies on amantadine and transcranial direct current stimulation provided class II evidence. Although new therapeutic approaches seem to be valuable for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness, optimised stimulation parameters, alternative drugs, or rehabilitation strategies still need to be tested and validated to improve rehabilitation and the quality of life of these patients."

### Summary
Nearly every individual sustaining a traumatic spinal cord injury receives multiple types and classes of drugs to manage a wide range of secondary complications associated with the neurotrauma. These range from drugs to manage blood pressure, to analgesics for concomitant traumatic injuries, to anticholinergics for spasms. A recent study showed the patients receive up to XX unique drugs within the first two months, often in combinatorial fashion. Despite the extreme polypharmacy, little is known to what degree common drugs used in the management of acute spinal cord injury have downstream, unintended, beneficial or detrimental, effects on neurological and functional outcomes. 
This is surprising in light of the fact that many drugs are: 1) spinal cord blood barrier (SCBB) permeable and/or gain access to the central nervous system via a leaky SCBB after injury, 2) act on targets in the central nervous system, and 3) administered during the window of opportunity to promote neural repair and plasticity (i.e., in the initial hours to weeks post injury).
To address the question of whether drugs administered in the acute phase of injury have the potential to modify neurological recovery, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies.

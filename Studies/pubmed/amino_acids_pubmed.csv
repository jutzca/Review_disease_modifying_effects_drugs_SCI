The cell types that primarily comprise the spinal cord are neurons and several categories of glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Ependymal cells and small populations of endogenous stem cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, also reside in the spinal cord. Neurons are interconnected in circuits; those that process cutaneous sensory input are mainly located in the dorsal spinal cord, while those involved in proprioception and motor control are predominately located in the ventral spinal cord. Due to the importance of the spinal cord, neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries affecting the spinal cord will lead to motor deficits and loss of sensory inputs.Spinal cord injury (SCI), resulting in paraplegia and tetraplegia as a result of deleterious interconnected mechanisms encompassed by the primary and secondary injury, represents a heterogeneously behavioral and cognitive deficit that remains incurable. Following SCI, various barriers containing the neuroinflammation, neural tissue defect (neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), cavity formation, loss of neuronal circuitry, and function must be overcame. Notably, the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of cell-cell communication networks play critical roles in homeostatic, driving the pathophysiologic and consequent cognitive outcomes. In the spinal cord, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia are involved in not only development but also pathology. Glial cells play dual roles (negative vs. positive effects) in these processes. After SCI, detrimental effects usually dominate and significantly retard functional recovery, and curbing these effects is critical for promoting neurological improvement. Indeed, residential innate immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) and infiltrating leukocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), activated by SCI, give rise to full-blown inflammatory cascades. These inflammatory cells release neurotoxins (proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, free radicals, excitotoxic amino acids, nitric oxide (NO)), all of which partake in axonal and neuronal deficit.Given the various multifaceted obstacles in SCI treatment, a combinatorial therapy of cell transplantation and biomaterial implantation may be addressed in detail here. For the sake of preserving damaged tissue integrity and providing physical support and trophic supply for axon regeneration, MSC transplantation has come to the front stage in therapy for SCI with the constant progress of stem cell engineering. MSC transplantation promotes scaffold integration and regenerative growth potential. Integrating into the implanted scaffold, MSCs influence implant integration by improving the healing process. Conversely, biomaterial scaffolds offer MSCs with a sheltered microenvironment from the surrounding pathological changes, in addition to bridging connection spinal cord stump and offering physical and directional support for axonal regeneration. Besides, Biomaterial scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix to suppress immune responses.Here, we review the advances in combinatorial biomaterial scaffolds and MSC transplantation approach that targets certain aspects of various intercellular communications in the pathologic process following SCI. Finally, the challenges of biomaterial-supported MSC transplantation and its future direction for neuronal regeneration will be presented."

Such signals include membrane-associated proteins of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and astrocyte-derived, matrix-associated proteins. Here, using cell lines and primary cortical neuron cultures, recombinant protein expression, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays, transmission EM of exosomes, and axon regeneration assays, we explored the secretion and activity of the myelin-associated neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo-A and observed exosomal release of a 24-kDa C-terminal Nogo-A fragment from cultured cells. We found that the cleavage site in this 1192-amino-acid-long fragment is located between amino acids 961-971. We also detected a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1)-interacting Nogo-66 domain on the exosome surface. Enzyme inhibitor treatment and siRNA knockdown revealed that β-secretase 1 (BACE1) is the protease responsible for Nogo-A cleavage. Functionally, exosomes with the Nogo-66 domain on their surface potently inhibited axonal regeneration of mechanically injured cerebral cortex neurons from mice. Production of this fragment was observed in the exosomal fraction from neuronal tissue lysates after spinal cord crush injury of mice. We also noted that, relative to the exosomal marker Alix, a Nogo-immunoreactive, 24-kDa protein is enriched in exosomes 2-fold after injury. We conclude that membrane-associated Nogo-A produced in oligodendrocytes is processed proteolytically by BACE1, is released via exosomes, and is a potent diffusible inhibitor of regenerative growth in NgR1-expressing axons."

The expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is increased, and exerts a protective role after traumatic SCI. However, the endogenous activity of HIF-1α is insufficient for promoting functional recovery. The present study tested the potential effect of the sustained activation of HIF-1α by the prolylhydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on anti-apoptotic process and the regulation of axonal regeneration after SCI. Here, we found that treatment with DMOG significantly increased the expression of HIF-1α and that the stabilization of HIF-1α induced by DMOG not only decreased the expression of apoptotic proteins to promote neural survival, but also enhanced axonal regeneration by regulating microtubule stabilization in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found that DMOG promoted neural survival and axonal regeneration by activating autophagy, which is induced by the HIF-1α/BNIP3 signaling pathway, and that the inhibition of HIF-1α or autophagy abrogated the protective effect of DMOG, as expected. Taken together, our results demonstrate that treatment with DMOG improves functional recovery after SCI and that DMOG may serve as a potential candidate for treating SCI."

Recent studies have reported that haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) fragments lacking 23 amino acids at the C-terminus (HO-1C[INCREMENT]23) exert novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in vitro. However, no study has identified the role of HO-1C[INCREMENT]23 in vivo. We aimed to investigate the protective effects of HO-1C[INCREMENT]23 on the BSCB after spinal cord injury (SCI) in a rat model. Here, adenoviral HO-1C[INCREMENT]23 (Ad-GFP-HO-1C[INCREMENT]23) was intrathecally injected into the 10th thoracic spinal cord segment (T10) 7 days before SCI. In addition, nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction and immunofluorescence staining of HO-1 were used to examine the effect of Ad-GFP-HO-1C[INCREMENT]23 on HO-1 nuclear translocation. Evan's blue staining served as an index of capillary permeability and was detected by fluorescence microscopy at 633 nm. Western blotting was also performed to detect tight junction protein expression. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score was used to evaluate kinematic functional recovery through the 28th day after SCI. In this study, the Ad-GFP-HO-1C[INCREMENT]23 group showed better kinematic functional recovery after SCI than the Ad-GFP and Vehicle groups, as well as smaller reductions in TJ proteins and capillary permeability compared with those in the Ad-GFP and Vehicle groups. These findings indicated that Ad-GFP-HO-1C[INCREMENT]23 might have a potential therapeutic effect that is mediated by its protection of BSCB integrity."

Experimental suppression of neuroinflammation encourages recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI), yet practical means for pharmacologically treating SCI have remained elusive. Lanthionine ketimine (LK) is a natural brain sulfur amino acid metabolite with demonstrated anti-neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic activities. LK and its synthetic brain-penetrating ethyl ester (LKE) promote growth factor-dependent neurite extension in cultured cell and suppress microglial activation in animal models of neurodegeneration. Thus far however, LKE has not been explored as a potential therapy for SCI. The present study investigated the hypothesis that systemic LKE could improve motor functional recovery after SCI in a mouse model. Intraperitoneal administration of LKE (100 mg/kg/d) after near-complete transect of spinal cord at the T7 level significantly improved motor function over a 4-week time course. Vehicle-treated mice, in contrast, demonstrated negligible functional recovery. In terms of histology, LKE treatment reduced pro-neuroinflammatory microglia/macrophage activation evidenced by quantitative Iba1 labeling and shifted the microglial phenotype toward a more neurotrophic M2 character evidenced by changes in the M2 marker arginase-1. This was correlated with less dense scar formation and more extensive axonal regrowth across the transection site demonstrated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) immunolabeling of raphespinal tract axons. These data provide evidence that LKE or similar compounds have potential therapeutic value for recovery after certain forms of SCI."

Herein, we will review advances in the understanding of the role of several proteins of the UPS in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). The UPS consists of many factors that include E3 ubiquitin ligases, ubiquitin hydrolases, ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules, and the proteasome itself. An extensive body of work links UPS dysfunction with AD pathogenesis and progression. More recently, the UPS has been shown to have vital roles in recovery of function after SCI. The ubiquitin hydrolase (Uch-L1) has been proposed to increase cellular levels of mono-ubiquitin and hence to increase rates of protein turnover by the UPS. A low Uch-L1 level has been linked with Aβ accumulation in AD and reduced neuroregeneration after SCI. One likely mechanism for these beneficial effects of Uch-L1 is reduced turnover of the PKA regulatory subunit and consequently, reduced signaling via CREB. The neuron-specific F-box protein Fbx2 ubiquitinates β-secretase thus targeting it for proteasomal degradation and reducing generation of Aβ. Both Uch-L1 and Fbx2 improve synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in mouse AD models. The role of Fbx2 after SCI has not been examined, but abolishing ß-secretase reduces neuronal recovery after SCI, associated with reduced myelination. UBB+1, which arises through a frame-shift mutation in the ubiquitin gene that adds 19 amino acids to the C-terminus of ubiquitin, inhibits proteasomal function and is associated with increased neurofibrillary tangles in patients with AD, Pick's disease and Down's syndrome. These advances in understanding of the roles of the UPS in AD and SCI raise new questions but, also, identify attractive and exciting targets for potential, future therapeutic interventions."

Spinal cord injury causes tissue damage in two successive waves. The initial injury is mechanical and directly causes primary tissue damage, which induces subsequent ischemia, inflammation, and neurotoxic factor release resulting in the secondary tissue damage. These lead to activation of glial cells. Activated glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes are common pathological observations in the damaged lesion. Activated microglia release glutamate, the major neurotoxic factor released into the extracellular space after neural injury, which causes neuronal death at high concentration. In the present study, we demonstrate that reduction of glutamate-mediated exitotoxicity via intraperitoneal administration of INI-0602 in the microenvironment of the injured spinal cord elicited neurobehavioral recovery and extensive suppression of glial scar formation by reducing secondary tissue damage. Further, this intervention stimulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, and subsequently elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, preventing microglial activation by a gap junction hemichannel blocker, INI-0602, may be a promising therapeutic strategy in spinal cord injury."

Cerebrolysin is a neuropeptide preparation which mimics the action of endogenous neurotrophic factors on brain protection and repair. In dementia models, Cerebrolysin decreases β-amyloid deposition and microtubule-associated protein tau phosphorylation by regulating glycogen synthase kinase-3β and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activity, increases synaptic density and restores neuronal cytoarchitecture. These effects protect integrity of the neuronal circuits and thus result in improved cognitive and behavioral performance. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin enhances neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, the basis for neuronal replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental studies in stroke animal models have shown that Cerebrolysin stabilizes the structural integrity of cells by inhibition of calpain and reduces the number of apoptotic cells after ischemic lesion. Cerebrolysin induces restorative processes, decreases infarct volume and edema formation and promotes functional recovery. Stroke-induced neurogenesis in the subventricular zone was also promoted by Cerebrolysin, thus supporting the brain's self-repair after stroke. Both, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury conditions stimulate the expression of natural neurotrophic factors to promote repair and regeneration processes -axonal regeneration, neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis- that is considered to be crucial for the future recovery. Neuroprotective effects of Cerebrolysin on experimentally induced traumatic spinal cord injury have shown that Cerebrolysin prevents apoptosis of lesioned motoneurons and promotes functional recovery. This section summarizes the most relevant data on the pharmacology of Cerebrolysin obtained from in vitro assays (biochemical and cell cultures) and in vivo animal models of acute and chronic neurological disorders."

Promoting structural plasticity may become an important component of future strategies to improve functional outcomes. We have recently observed dynamic changes in the density and morphology of dendritic spines in the motor cortex following SCI. The present study sought to test whether SCI-induced changes in spine density and morphology could be modulated by potential strategies to enhance functional recovery. We examined the effects of enriched environment, transplants, and neurotrophin-3 on the plasticity of synaptic structures in the motor cortex following SCI. Housing rats in an enriched environment increased spine density in the motor cortex regardless of injury. SCI led to a more slender and elongated spine morphology. Enriched housing mitigated the SCI-induced morphological alterations, suggesting that the environmental modification facilitates maturation of synaptic structures. Transplantation of embryonic spinal cord tissue and delivery of neurotrophin-3 at the injury site further increased spine density when combined with enriched housing. This combinatorial treatment completely abolished the injury-induced changes, restoring a preinjury pattern of spine morphology. These results demonstrated that remodeling of dendritic spines in the motor cortex after SCI can be modulated by enriched housing, and the combinatorial treatment with embryonic transplants and neurotrophin-3 can potentiate the effects of enriched housing. We suggest that synaptic remodeling processes in the motor cortex can be targeted for an intervention to enhance functional recovery after SCI."

Dendritic spines in the rat motor cortex were visualized by confocal microscopy in fixed slices, and their density and morphology were analyzed after an overhemisection injury at C4 level. Spine density decreased at 7 days and partially recovered by 28 days. Spine head diameter significantly increased in a layer-specific manner. SCI led to a higher proportion of longer spines especially at 28 days, resulting in a roughly 10% increase in mean spine length. In addition, filopodium-like long dendritic protrusions were more frequently observed after SCI, suggesting an increase in synaptogenic events. This spine remodeling was accompanied by increased expression of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, which attenuates adhesion between the pre- and postsynaptic membranes, in the motor cortex from as early as 3 days to 2 weeks after injury, suggesting a decrease in synaptic adhesion during the remodeling process. These results demonstrate time-dependent changes in spine density and morphology in the motor cortex following SCI. This synaptic remodeling seems to proceed with a time scale ranging from days to weeks. Elongation of dendritic spines may indicate a more immature and modifiable pattern of synaptic connectivity in the motor cortex being reorganized following SCI."

In the present study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of NMDA receptor antagonists that were infused segmentally after aortic clamping, as a spinoplegia, to reduce aspartate neurotoxicity in the spinal cord. Infrarenal aortic isolation was performed in New Zealand white rabbits. Group A animals (n = 7) were pretreated with the segmental infusion of MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, followed by segmental aspartate (50 mmol) infusion for 10 minutes. Group B animals (n = 6) received pretreatment with CGS19755, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, followed by the same aspartate infusion as group A. Group C animals (n = 7) received vehicle only, followed by aspartate infusion as a control group. In addition, group D animals (n = 6) were pretreated with MK-801 that was administrated intravenously 1 hour before aspartate infusion. Neurologic status was assessed at 12, 24, and 48 hours after operation by using the Tarlov score. The spinal cords were procured at 48 hours for histopathologic analysis to determine the extent of excitotoxic neuronal injury. Most of the animals in groups A and D revealed full recovery or mild motor disturbance. Group B and C animals exhibited paraplegia or paraparesis with marked neuronal necrosis. In the Tarlov score at 48 hours, group A animals represented better neurologic function than group C (P < .01) and similar motor function to group D animals. Severe histopathologic change was not observed in groups A and D. Animals in groups A and D showed a greater number of motor neurons than animals in groups B and C (P < .01). The difference could be due to chance between group A and D animals (P = .08). These results showed that the segmental infusion of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist as an intraoperative spinoplegia could have a protective effect on the spinal cord neurons against excitotoxic neuronal injury in vivo. On the other hand, efficacy of the use of competitive antagonist was suggested to be limited in this model, probably because of the insurmountable obstacle of the blood-brain barrier. Paraplegia is a devastating complication during surgical repair of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortas. Excitatory amino acids neurotoxicity through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is no doubt the pathologic hallmark of ischemic and postischemic spinal cord injury. Systemic administration of either a competitive or noncompetitive NMDA antagonist has been reported to have neuroprotective effect, in terms of preoperative treatment, with dose-related central sympathomimetic and sedative effects. Local administration, particularly of a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, infused segmentally after aortic clamping could therefore be a potent intraoperative pharmacologic strategy to minimize the effective dose that retains NMDA antagonism without undesirable adverse effects. Our ability to reproduce this model could facilitate pharmacologic prevention or provide a new surgical technique as a spinoplegia for NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal injury."

In the trauma created control group, the mean motor function scores decreased to 1.16 +/- 0.40 and to 1 +/- 0 on the 3(rd) and 5(th) day, respectively. In this group the mean values of the inclined plane were 39.16 +/- 2.04 on the 3(rd) day and 37.91 +/- 1.02 on the 5(th) day. No statistically significant difference was observed in both tissue lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels for all time points between the aminoguanidine group and the sham-operated controls (p>0.01). The motor function scores were observed as 2.16 +/- 0.40 on the 3(rd) day and as 3 +/- 0 on the 5(th) day in aminoguanidine group. These values were significantly higher than the trauma created controls (p<0.01). Aminoguanidin treatment also improved the inclined plane performance of the rats; In this group, the mean values of the inclined plane scores were 44.58 +/- 2.92 and 52.91 +/- 1.88 on the 3(rd) and 5(th) days, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the trauma created controls (p<0.01). This study shows that the nitric oxide level does not increase in the spinal cord tissue during the first hour after the spinal cord trauma. It increases significantly in the spinal cord tissue not only three days but also five days following the trauma. Aminoguanidine treatment, which is started just after the trauma, can prevent both the nitric oxide production and lipid peroxidation in spinal cord tissue and it can improve the functional status of the animals. In this respect, aminoguanidine may have a potential role in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury."

Also discussed are the major factors that can contribute to cell death, such as glutamatergic excitotoxicity, free radical damage, cytokines, and inflammation. The development of innovative therapeutic strategies to reduce secondary spinal cord injury depends on an increased understanding of secondary injury mechanisms at the molecular and biochemical level. Such therapeutic interventions may include the use of antiapoptotic drugs, free radical scavengers, and anti-inflammatory agents. These could be targeted to block key reactions on cellular and molecular injury cascades, thus reducing secondary tissue damage, minimizing side effects, and improving functional recovery."

Control rats received the compression injury only. Intraspinal norepinephrine was depleted in one rat group by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the subarachnoid space to selectively destroy catecholamine neurons and in a third group MK-801 was administered intravenously to block receptors for N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), an excitatory amino acid. Recovery from motor paralysis and suppression of edema of the spinal cord were then compared in the three groups. Significant recovery from motor paralysis was found 12 h after injury in the 6-OHDA-treated rats, compared with the controls, and 24 h after injury in the MK-801-treated rats. Edema of the spinal cord was significantly suppressed for up to 24 h after injury in the 6-OHDA-treated rats. The MK-801-treated rats showed no significant suppression of the edema until 24 h after the spinal cord injury. It was concluded that norepinephrine is primarily involved in the formation of vasogenic edemas, which develop in the early stages after an injury, whereas excitatory amino acids affect the formation of cytotoxic edemas, which develop at a relatively later stage."

This study examined the rostral-caudal distribution of neutrophils and macrophages/microglia at 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after contusion injury to the T10 spinal cord of rat (10 g weight, 50 mm drop). Neutrophils were located predominantly in necrotic regions, with a time course that peaked at 24 h as measured with assays of myeloperoxidase activity (MPO). The sharpest peak of MPO activity was localized between 4 mm rostral and caudal to the injury. Macrophages/microglia were visualized with antibodies against ED1 and OX-42. Numerous cells with a phagocytic morphology were present by 24 h, with a higher number by 48 h. These cells were predominantly located within the gray matter and dorsal funiculus white matter. The number of cells gradually declined through 6 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion. OX-42 staining also revealed reactive microglia with blunt processes, particularly at levels distant to the lesion. The number of macrophages/microglia was significantly correlated with the amount of tissue damage at each level. Treatments to decrease the inflammatory response are likely to be beneficial to recovery of function after traumatic spinal cord injury."

Experiments were performed on 36 animals divided into three groups; sham operated controls, laser irradiated surgical controls, and amino acid groups. Acute responses to injury were evaluated with somatosensory (SSEP) and motor evoked potentials (MEP) and functional recovery was assessed for 8 weeks using the inclined plane technique. In the laser irradiated surgical control group, MEP disappeared one hour after the laser injury, but SSEP revealed changes of amplitude and latency. In this group, the average value of the inclined plane at 24 hours after the laser application was 45.3 +/- 1.4 degrees. In the amino acid group, at the sixth hour of injury, MEP and SSEP changes improved with infusion of HDAAS for 4 hours.

The protective effects of a variety of competitive and non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists indicate that activation of the NMDA receptor complex is essential for dynorphin A-induced spinal cord injury. 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC) is a high affinity, partial agonist at strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors associated with the NMDA receptor complex. Pretreatment of rats with ACPC (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior to dynorphin A) significantly eliminated the persistent hindlimb motor deficits and neuropathological changes produced by 20 nmol of this peptide. The neuroprotective effects of ACPC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) were abolished by parenteral administration of glycine (800 mg/kg, 30 min prior to ACPC), consistent with other in vivo and in vitro studies indicating that the pharmacological actions of ACPC are effected through strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors. When given instead as six daily injections (200 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by an injection-free day, ACPC also significantly improved neurological recovery following dynorphin-A injection. These results support earlier indications that: (1) activation of the NMDA receptor complex plays a critical role in mediating dynorphin A-induced rat spinal cord injury; (2) ACPC provides an effective means of antagonizing excitotoxic phenomena; and (3) chronic administration of ACPC can elicit a persistent change in the NMDA receptor complex."

Coadministration of the vasodilator hydralazine substantially eliminated the paralytic, anaerobic metabolic and neuropathological responses to dynorphin A. In contrast, in concentrations up to 1 mM, dynorphin A did not alter the viability of cultured rat spinal cord neurons. Thus, it appears that this peptide lacks direct neurotoxic effects and that neuronal injuries in vivo result primarily from ischemia associated with dynorphin A-induced blood flow reductions. NMDA receptor antagonists significantly improved recovery from dynorphin A-induced hindlimb paralysis, and substantially eliminated neuropathological changes without attenuating the acute blood flow reductions or lactic acid elevations. Additionally, glutamate and aspartate concentrations were increased significantly in spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid samples removed during the time that peptide-induced spinal cord blood flow reductions were observed. In contrast, neither amino acid concentration was elevated in media removed after 1-hr exposure of spinal cord neuronal cell cultures to 100 microM concentrations of dynorphin A.

Microdialysis was performed during continuous epidural SCS in animals subjected to ischemic spinal cord injury. Recovery of amino acid neurotransmitters from stimulated, injured animals was compared to that from a control group. Evoked potentials from the cortex and spinal cord were recorded to insure adequate stimulation and stable cord function. A significant increase in the concentrations of glycine and taurine was seen before, during, and after 90 minutes of continuous stimulation and was independent of the degree of injury.

Ethanol-treated rats had significantly lower tissue levels of excitatory amino acids and higher levels of free fatty acids, thromboxane, and lactic acid than did controls. Tissue magnesium concentration was significantly reduced by trauma and recovered more slowly in ethanol-treated rats. Enhanced phospholipid hydrolysis with free fatty acid and thromboxane accumulation, increased release of excitatory amino acids, and decreased tissue magnesium levels may each serve to worsen secondary tissue damage and diminish neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury associated with acute alcohol intoxication."

We performed a secondary longitudinal analysis of a cohort of adult patients with traumatic acute spinal cord injury. Cumulative baclofen dose was computed over the first 4 weeks following injury from concomitant medication information from a completed clinical trial. The main outcome measure was neurologic status, which was assessed over 52 weeks with ""marked recovery"" defined as the conversion to higher sensory and motor function. To complete the drug safety profile, drug toxicity was assessed with assays from standard blood work. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of the cohort (n = 651), 18% (n = 115) received baclofen within 4 weeks post injury. Baclofen use was associated with higher rates of marked neurologic recovery, even after adjustment for injury severity (HR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0 for high dose vs none). Baclofen exposure was not associated with liver or renal side effects. The use of other medications indicated for spasticity was not associated with neurological outcomes. Overall, this longitudinal analysis provides level 3 evidence on the neurologic safety of baclofen and potential beneficial effects on recovery in the early days after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The usefulness of concomitant medication files from completed clinical trials is highlighted. We also highlight the importance of incorporating logical patient questions and neurological outcomes into research addressing drug safety."

Thus, it is of crucial importance to find ways to promote axonal regeneration. In addition, the prevention of retrograde degeneration leading to the atrophy/death of descending neurons is an obvious prerequisite to activate axonal regeneration. Lampreys show an amazing regenerative capacity after SCI. Recent histological work in lampreys suggested that GABA, which is massively released after a SCI, could promote the survival of descending neurons. Here, we aimed to study if GABA, acting through GABAB receptors, promotes the survival and axonal regeneration of descending neurons of larval sea lampreys after a complete SCI. First, we used in situ hybridization to confirm that identifiable descending neurons of late-stage larvae express the gabab1 subunit of the GABAB receptor. We also observed an acute increase in the expression of this subunit in descending neurons after SCI, which further supported the possible role of GABA and GABAB receptors in promoting the survival and regeneration of these neurons. So, we performed gain and loss of function experiments to confirm this hypothesis. Treatments with GABA and baclofen (GABAB agonist) significantly reduced caspase activation in descending neurons 2 weeks after a complete SCI. Long-term treatments with GABOB (a GABA analogue) and baclofen significantly promoted axonal regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. These data indicate that GABAergic signalling through GABAB receptors promotes the survival and regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. Finally, we used morpholinos against the gabab1 subunit to knockdown the expression of the GABAB receptor in descending neurons. Long-term morpholino treatments caused a significant inhibition of axonal regeneration. This shows that endogenous GABA promotes axonal regeneration after a complete SCI in lampreys by activating GABAB receptors."

An uncommonly reported presentation of AD is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). A 50-year-old male with the history of paraplegia from SCI presented with sepsis secondary to baclofen pump and urinary tract infections. On hospital day 4, he developed acute bilateral vision loss. The next morning he had a generalized-tonic-clonic seizure followed by cardiac arrest, with return of spontaneous circulation following resuscitation. Magnetic resonance imaging brain demonstrated multifocal areas of hyperintensity on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, most pronounced in the occipital lobes. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) were under 180 mmHg throughout hospital stay but above his baseline (SBP 90 mmHg). PRES was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiologic evidence. With strict blood pressure (BP) control, there was resolution of visual abnormalities, headaches, encephalopathy, and seizures. Although PRES has been most commonly described in malignant hypertension, it can be seen in patients with normotension or moderate hypertension who have low baseline BPs, such as patients with SCI. These patients are prone to AD due to imbalanced sympathetic outflow to vasculature below the level of injury caused by noxious stimulus. This results in massive regional vasoconstriction leading to an uncontrolled rise in BP above baseline. This episode of PRES could have been prevented by identifying patient's risk, recognizing early signs and potential triggers of AD, and implementing aggressive treatment of the underlying noxious stimuli."

Previous work has described adaptations in spinal systems that might underlie this hyperexcitability, including an increase in constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors in spinal motoneurons. That work, however, examined adaptations following complete transection SCI, whereas SCI in humans is usually anatomically and functionally incomplete. We therefore evaluated whether constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors contributes to reflex hyperexcitability in an incomplete compression model of SCI and to spasms in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm that 5-HT2C receptor constitutive activity contributes to reflex excitability after incomplete SCI. We also evaluated whether constitutive activity could be altered by manipulation of neural activity levels after SCI, testing the hypothesis that it reflects homeostatic processes acting to maintain spinal excitability. We decreased neural activity after SCI by administering baclofen and increased activity by administering the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. We found that drug administration produced minimal alterations in in vivo locomotor function or reflex excitability. Similarly, we found that neither baclofen nor fluoxetine altered the contribution of constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors to reflexes after SCI, although the contribution of 5-HT2C receptors to reflex activity was altered after SSRIs. These results confirm the importance of constitutive activity in 5-HT2C receptors to spinal hyperexcitability following SCI in the clinically relevant case of incomplete SCI but suggest that this activity is not driven by homeostatic processes that act to maintain overall levels of spinal excitability.NEW & NOTEWORTHY After spinal cord injury (SCI), most people will develop muscle spasms below their level of injury that can severely impact function. In this work, we examine the adaptations that occur within the spinal cord after SCI that contribute to these motor dysfunctions. We also evaluate one hypothesis about how these adaptations develop, which will potentially lead to intervention strategies to improve functional outcomes in persons with SCI."

The degree of consciousness varies from coma to vegetative state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state. Correct diagnosis has important ethical and legal implications, and pain may be cause of misdiagnosis. We describe here a patient with traumatic brain injury, classified as UWS. His clinical picture was dominated by spasticity, and pain. He underwent intrathecal treatment of spasticity with baclofen. Improvement was not that expected. However, there was a dramatic improvement when ziconotide was added to relieve pain; the patient began to eat by mouth, talk, and his tracheal tube could be removed and he is currently classified as having severe disability. The suspension of ziconotide caused a clear re-worsening of clinical condition, reverted by his reintroduction. Pain is an important factor in patients with DOC. Anecdotal reports of improved consciousness with intrathecal baclofen therapy may be due to pain relief. Reduction of pain in DOC is important and drugs should not interfere with cognition, and must be effective and manageable. Ziconotide may be one of the possible candidate due to its synergistic antispastic action in combination with baclofen when an intratecal pump has been implanted."

Other drugs may help to ameliorate the neuropathological changes resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), such as spasticity or demyelination, to improve walking. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of pharmacological agents on gait in people with SCI. A keyword literature search of articles that evaluated the effects of drugs on walking after SCI was performed using the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and hand searching. Two reviewers independently evaluated each study, using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) tool for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and the modified Downs & Black scale for all other studies. Results were tabulated and levels of evidence were assigned. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. One RCT provided Level 1 evidence that GM-1 ganglioside in combination with physical therapy improved motor scores, walking velocity, and distance better than placebo and physical therapy in persons with incomplete SCI. Multiple studies (levels of evidence 1-5) showed that clonidine and cyproheptadine may improve locomotor function and walking speed in severely impaired individuals with incomplete SCI. Gains in walking speed associated with GM-1, cyproheptadine, and clonidine are low compared to those seen with locomotor training. There was also Level 1 evidence that 4-aminopyridine and L-dopa were no better than placebo in helping to improve gait. Two Level 5 studies showed that baclofen had little to no effect on improving walking in persons with incomplete SCI. There is limited evidence that pharmacological agents tested so far would facilitate the recovery of walking after SCI. More studies are needed to better understand the effects of drugs combined with gait training on walking outcomes in people with SCI."

To further understand changes in excitatory and inhibitory brainstem interneuronal circuits following SCI, we studied recovery curves of the blink reflex (BR) to paired suprathreshold stimuli at various intervals (160, 300, 500, and 1000 msec), and prepulse inhibition of the BR following right index finger stimulation 100 msec prior to supraorbital nerve stimulation. Both parameters were studied in patients with SCI without baclofen treatment (n = 19), in patients with continuous intrathecal baclofen (CITB) (n = 9), and in healthy controls (n = 13). R2 recovery, expressed as the ratio of R2 area following the second stimulus divided by the R2 area following the first stimulus, was significantly greater in SCI patients without baclofen compared to controls and patients with CITB at all intervals, while there was no difference between patients with CITB and controls. Prepulse inhibition of R2 was significantly less in patients without baclofen compared to patients with CITB and healthy controls. Our findings indicate enhanced excitability and reduced inhibition of brainstem interneuronal circuits in patients with SCI, that are restored in the presence of baclofen to levels comparable to controls. In conclusion, SCI patients show more extended alterations in brainstem circuitry than previously thought. Decreased GABAergic mechanisms seem to be related to both excitatory and inhibitory brainstem circuit alterations. Baclofen appears to effectively restore this decreased GABAeregic activity."

Because the half-life time of GABA is very short in vivo, GABA itself is not used for clinical practice. An analogue of GABA, baclofen, is an agonist of GABA-B receptor, and has very strong antispastic effect by acting to the posterior horn of the spinal cord. However, baclofen poorly crosses through the blood brain barrier, and the antispastic effect is modest when administered orally. Therefore, direct continuous infusion of small doses of baclofen into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal baclofen therapy, ITB) has become an established treatment for control of otherwise intractable severe spasticity. Spasticity is clinically defined as hypertonic state of the muscles with increased tendon reflexes, muscles spasm, spasm pain, abnormal posture, and limitation of involuntary movements. Spasticity is a common symptom after damage mainly to the pyramidal tract system in the brain or the spinal cord. Such damage is caused by traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and so on. Patients in persistent vegetative state (PVS) usually have diffuse and widespread damage to the brain, spasticity is generally seen in such patients. Control of spasticity may become important in the management of PVS patients in terms of nursing care, pain relief, and hygiene, and ITB may be indicated. Among PVS patients who had ITB to control spasticity, sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from PVS after ITB have been reported worldwide. The mechanism of such recovery of consciousness is poorly understood, and it may simply be a coincidence. On the other hand, electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been tried for many years in many patients in PVS, and some positive effects on recovery of consciousness have been reported. SCS is usually indicated for control of neuropathic pain, but it has also antispastic effect. The mechanism of SCS on pain is known to be mediated through the spinal GABA neuronal system. Thus, ITB and SCS have a common background, spinal GABA neuronal mechanism. The effect of GABA agonists on recovery of consciousness is not yet established, but review of such case studies becomes a clue to solve problems in PVS, and there may be hidden serendipity."

Thanks to appropriate management at all treatment stages (prompt, fully professional assistance in the ambulance, followed by appropriate management at ICU), the child survived. Owing to currently available technical solutions, the boy has achieved considerable self-dependence and an opportunity of having post-traumatic complications treated using a diaphragm pacing stimulator and a baclofen pump. The report presents therapeutic problems encountered in children with post-traumatic spinal cord injury, emphasizing technical opportunities of managing diaphragm paralysis, as exemplified by the five-year treatment and rehabilitation process of a boy with spinal cord injury at C1 level managed at the University Children's Hospital of Cracow, Poland, in whom phrenic nerve stimulation was employed. The implanted stimulator and a specially constructed controller have allowed the boy to achieve mobility using a wheelchair, being able to use a PC and being taught by an individual teacher at home despite his tetraparesis. Recurrent respiratory tract infections and occasional decubitus required periodic hospitalizations.

The recent National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) showed that very high dose methylprednisolone given within 8 hr after injury improves neurologic recovery. The mechanism is believed to be inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Many other drugs have been claimed to be beneficial in animal studies, including other lipid peroxidation inhibitors, free radical scavengers, opiate receptor blockers, NMDA receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, and protease inhibitors. In chronic spinal cord injury, much progress also has been made. Myelin was found to possess factors that inhibit axonal regeneration. Blocking these factors enhances spinal cord regeneration. Monosialic gangliosides (GM1) were recently found to improve neurologic recovery in spinal-cord-injured patients. Given as late as 48-72 hr after injury, the mechanism of action is not well understood. However, the GM1 results give hope that recovery mechanisms can be manipulated pharmacologically. Nonregenerative therapy for chronic spinal cord injury is also being developed. Several drugs, including 4-aminopyridine and baclofen, respectively blockers of potassium channels and GABA-B receptors, improve conduction in demyelinated axons. These drugs may be useful for identifying patients who might benefit from remyelination therapy. Finally, NASCIS has complicated acute spinal cord injury studies. To bring a drug to clinical trial, an investigator must now determine the optimal treatment dose, timing, and duration over a range of injury severities, in comparison and combination with methylprednisolone. This requirement has so increased the scale of drug testing that multicenter laboratory trials may be necessary."

Gangliosides have been shown to promote neuronal repair and recovery of neurological function after spinal cord injury. Previously, we confirmed that in vivo administration of the ganglioside GM-1 attenuated bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity in various animal models; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Cells of the neuroblastoma line N2a (Neuro2a cells) were divided into three experimental groups: control, bupivacaine-treated, and bupivacaine-treated with GM-1 pretreatment. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed through CCK-8 assays, Hoechst staining, and flow cytometry analysis of Annexin-V/propidium iodide double labeling. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assessed the expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. Bupivacaine-induced apoptosis worsened with increasing dose and exposure time. Bupivacaine induced increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not caspase-8, indicating that the mitochondrial pathway but not the death receptor apoptosis pathway was activated. GM-1 pretreatment inhibited bupivacaine-induced apoptosis and the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a dose-dependent manner. Bupivacaine induced neurotoxicity by activating apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, and this was inhibited by GM-1 pretreatment."

We have evaluated in 27 rats the functional, electrophysiological and anatomical consequences of a photochemical spinal-cord lesion induced before or after intrathecal injection of bupivacaine. After randomization, nine rats received 20 micro L of intrathecal bupivacaine 0.5% 15 min before a photochemical spinal-cord lesion (Group I) and eight rats received 20 micro L intrathecal bupivacaine 15 min after such a lesion (Group II). Ten rats received 20 micro L of saline 15 min before the photochemical injury (control group). Paraplegia was tested on days one, three, five, seven, nine, 12, 15 and 18 using an evaluation of hindlimb movements and an inclined plane stability test. Sensory block was evaluated by the animal's response when each hindlimb was brought into contact with a hot plate. Sympathetic injury was evaluated in terms of bladder voiding dysfunction. On day 18, residual somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were measured and the area of the intact spinal cord was determined using a digitalized system. Early paraplegia recovery was found in the two bupivacaine groups (P < 0.05). On day 12, motor recovery was complete in both bupivacaine groups whereas recovery was not complete on day 18 in the control group. Compared to the control group, inclined plane stability recovered earlier in Groups I and II, from day three to day 15. Sensory and sympathetic block scores were not different in the three groups. Nevertheless, SEP latencies were longer and amplitudes were lower in control group rats compared with the two bupivacaine groups on day 18. The intact spinal-cord cross-sectional area around the lesion was not different in the three groups. Twenty microlitres of intrathecal bupivacaine before or after acute photochemical spinal injury improves hindlimb motor recovery and SEP parameters in rats."

After 4 ml of lignocaine 1.5% was injected through the catheter, hypotension resulted. Fifty-five minutes later 5 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% produced the same effect. In the recovery room a similar injection resulted in lower blood pressure and temporary apnoea. Sensory and motor deficits were noted the next day and four days later magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spinal cord syringomyelia extending from T5 to T10. Four years later, dysaesthesia from T6 to T10 weakness of the left lower extremity and bladder and bowel dysfunction persist. The risks of inserting thoracic epidural catheters in patients under general anaesthesia and muscle relaxation are discussed, emphasising the possibility of spinal cord injury with disastrous consequences."

This Na+ leak likely occurs via incompletely inactivated voltage-gated Na+ channels. This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 microM were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (< or = 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 microM), disopyramide (10-300 microM) and bupivacaine (10-100 microM) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 microM. Procainamide (100-300 microM) was ineffective. These results suggest that Na+ channel blockers, including commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, may be effective in protecting central white matter, which is a target for anoxic/ischemic injury in diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury."

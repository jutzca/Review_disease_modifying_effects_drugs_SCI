To investigate the effects of different rehabilitation strategies on functional recovery of partial spinal cord of injured rats. Activity-based rehabilitation is promising strategy for improving functional recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180 to 220 g were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (450 mg kg⁻¹) by intraperitoneal injection, and laminectomy was performed at T7-T8 level, leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 × 5.0 mm) loaded with weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed cord for 5 minutes to create partial SCI. Animals were divided into 3 groups of 8 rats each. Group 1 served as control (SCI + without treadmill and swimming training). Whereas rats in Groups 2 and 3 were subjected to SCI as mentioned previously and received swimming training 5 minutes for Group 2 and treadmill training 5 minutes for Group 3 each day, which occurred beginning 14 days postsurgery and continued for 14 days. The spontaneous coordinate activity (SCA), Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB), and Tarlov locomotor scores were used to assess functional recovery of spinal cord injured rats. Day 1 (baseline, 14 days after the surgery), there was no significant difference among the means for SCA, BBB, and Tarlov scores of all groups. After day 1, Groups 1, 2, and 3 showed continuous improvement in their BBB, Tarlov, and SCA scores. This improvement was maintained throughout the duration of the study with different levels for each group. By the end of the study, trained Groups 2 and 3 showed statistically significant improvement in their SCA, BBB, and Tarlov scores compared with Group 1 (P < 0.05). These results suggest that 2 weeks of treadmill locomotor training and swimming training may have positive effects on functional recovery after partial SCI."

Research Center, Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180-220 g were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (450 mg kg(-1) body weight) by intraperitoneal injection and laminectomy was performed at the T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) was loaded with a weight of 35 g placed on the exposed cord for 5 min to create SCI. The subjects were divided into three groups of eight rats each. Group 1 served as control (SCI+saline); whereas groups 2 and 3 served as test groups, alpha-tocopherol was given orally in doses of 1000 mg kg(-1) body weight for group 2 and 2000 mg kg(-1) body weight for group 3, respectively. Daily activities were recorded in the activity cage for 14 days post-operatively. At day 1 (baseline, 24 h after the surgery), there was no significant difference between mean motor scores of all groups. After day 1, the three groups showed continuous improvement in motor score; such improvement was maintained throughout the duration of the study with different levels for each group. By the end of the study (day 14), groups 2 and 3 showed statistically significant improvement in the mean motor score compared with group 1 (P<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between test groups 2 and 3 by the end of the study. The results suggest that the administration of alpha-tocopherol may have reparative effects for SCI because of its antioxidant effect."

This has been reported to be lost after spinal cord transection (txSCI), contributing to impaired function. However, anesthesia may confound evaluating EUS activity. We therefore evaluated urodynamic parameters in unanesthetized, restrained rats and compared the effects of txSCI to that of a clinically relevant, incomplete, contusive injury (iSCI) on lower urinary tract function. Adult female rats were subjected to txSCI or standardized iSCI at the T8 vertebral level. As expected, all injured rats were initially unable to void but developed a reflex bladder with time, with iSCI rats recovering more rapidly than txSCI rats. LUT function was evaluated urodynamically at 2 and 6 weeks after injury. In response to infusion of saline into the bladder, controls consistently exhibited coordinated contraction of the bladder and activation of the EUS in a phasic pattern and had a high voiding efficiency (86.4+/-2.5%). Voiding efficiency of iSCI rats was reduced to approximately 57% and txSCI rats to approximately 32%. However, two different patterns of EUS activity during voiding were present in both txSCI and iSCI groups at both time points: (1) rats with phasic EUS activity, similar to controls and (2) those that only exhibited tonic EUS activity during voiding. The former had more normal voiding efficiencies. Thus, phasic EUS activity and the improved voiding efficiency associated with it can occur and can be detected in unanesthetized rats after both incomplete and complete SCI."

Experiments were conducted on C(2) spinal cord-hemisected, anesthetized (chloral hydrate, 400 mg/kg ip), vagotomized, pancuronium- paralyzed, and artificially ventilated female Sprague-Dawley rats in which CO(2) levels were monitored and maintained. Twenty-four hours after spinal hemisection, the ipsilateral phrenic nerve displayed no respiratory-related activity indicative of a functionally complete hemisection. Intravenous administration of the 5-HT(2A/2C)-receptor agonist (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) induced respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection under conditions in which CO(2) was maintained at constant levels and augmented the activity induced under conditions of hypercapnia. The effects of DOI were found to be dose dependent, and the recovery of activity could be maintained for up to 2 h after a single injection. DOI-induced recovery was attenuated by the 5-HT(2)-receptor antagonist ketanserin but not with the 5-HT(2C)-receptor antagonist RS-102221, suggesting that 5-HT(2A) and not necessarily 5-HT(2C) receptors may be involved in the induction of respiratory recovery after cervical spinal cord injury."

Industrial workers exposed to ACR have been reported to suffer from a variety of central and peripheral neuropathological symptoms including numbness of hands and feet, skin peeling and muscular weakness of legs. These reports suggest that the body burden of ACR may be a risk factor in recovery patterns following neurotrauma. The present study was designed to assess the effect of ACR on neurological recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-230 g were anaesthetised with chloral hydrate and laminectomy was performed at T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) loaded with a weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed cord for 5 minutes. Animals were divided into seven groups of eight rats each. The animals in Group 1 served as control whereas rats in Group 2 underwent laminectomy alone (sham). The rats in Group 3 to 6 were subjected to SCI as mentioned above. Animals in Groups 4, 5 and 6 also received ACR in the doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, i.p., respectively in addition to SCI, whereas the rats in Group 7 received ACR alone at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. The first dose of ACR was given 30 minutes before SCI, followed by daily administration of drug for 7 days. Post traumatic neurological recovery was recorded daily for 10 days using a modified Tarlov score, inclined plane test and sensory and vocal score. Electrophysiological changes were assessed using somatosensory and corticomotor evoked potentials. The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals and the injured site of the spinal cord was analysed for lipid hydroperoxides (LPH), conjugated dienes (CD) and glutathione (GSH). Neuropathological changes in the spinal cord were assessed using light microscopy. The rats exposed to compression injury alone showed a maximum neurological deficit at 24 hr and then a gradual recovery was observed over a period of 10 days. The rats treated with ACR along with SCI showed poor or no recovery over a period of 10 days. Our electrophysiological and histopathological studies also confirmed that concomitant exposure to ACR produces a significant deleterious effect on the recovery from SCI. SCI induced increase in oxidative stress (increase in LPH and CD and decrease in GSH) is also exacerbated by ACR suggesting a role of free radicals. The results of this study suggest that increased body burden of ACR may retard the recovery from neurotrauma or even lead to permanent disability."

Experimental diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 250-280 g) with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg i.p.). Eight weeks after the treatment with streptozotocin the animals were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate and laminectomy was performed at T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) loaded with a weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed spinal cord for 5 min. Postoperative neurological function was assessed using inclined plane test, modified Tarlov score, and vocal and sensory score daily for 10 days. Electrophysiological changes were assessed using somatosensory and corticomotor evoked-potentials. The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals and injured site of the spinal cord was analyzed for changes in vitamin E and glutathione levels (as markers of oxidative stress). Pathological changes in spinal cord were also studied using light microscopy. The data on neurobehavioral study clearly indicated that the compression of spinal cord produced highly significant neurological deficit and poor recovery in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats. Our histopathological and electrophysiological results also confirmed that diabetic animals are more susceptible to compressive spinal cord injury as compared to nondiabetic animals. A higher depletion of antioxidant defense markers (vitamin E and glutathione) was observed in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats. These results point toward the role of free radicals in poor recovery in diabetic rats following neurotrauma. Further studies are warranted to assess the neuroprotective potential of antioxidants to retard the secondary pathophysiological events following neurotrauma and to enhance the recovery."

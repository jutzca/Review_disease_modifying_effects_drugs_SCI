Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) decomposes chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the glial scar that forms following SCI, allowing stem cells to penetrate through the scar and promote recovery of nerve function. This study aimed to establish ADSCs that stably express ChABC (ChABC-ADSCs) and evaluate the migratory capability of ChABC-ADSCs in vitro. ADSCs were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats using secondary collagenase digestion. Their phenotypes were characterized using flow cytometry detection of cell surface antigens and their stem cell properties were confirmed by induction of differentiation. After successful culture, ADSCs were transfected with lentiviral vectors and ChABC-ADSCs were obtained. Proliferation curves of ChABC-ADSCs were determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 method, ChABC expression was verified using Western blotting, and the migration of ChABC-ADSCs was analyzed using the transwell assay. Secondary collagenase digestion increased the isolation efficiency of primary ADSCs. Following transfection using lentiviral vectors, the proliferation of ChABC-ADSCs was reduced in comparison with control ADSCs at 48 h (P < 0.05). And the level of ChABC expression in the ChABC-ADSC group was significantly higher than that of the ADSC group (P < 0.05). Moreover, ChABC-ADSC migration in matrigel was significantly enhanced in comparison with the control (P < 0.05). Secondary collagenase digestion can be used to effectively isolate ADSCs. ChABC-ADSCs constructed using lentiviral vector transfection stably express ChABC, and ChABC expression significantly enhances the migratory capacity of ADSCs."

Exaggerated inflammation and apoptosis are two pivotal pathological processes for secondary brain injury after ICH. Quercetin, a flavonoid widely distributed in various herbs, fruits and vegetables, has been proved to improve neuronal functional recovery in spinal cord injury rats. However, the efficacy of quercetin in caring for post-ICH brain injury has not been investigated. In the present study, we established an ICH model by injecting type VII bacterial collagenase (0.5U) into the central striatum of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were randomized to four groups: sham-operation group; ICH + vehicle group; ICH + 5 mg/kg quercetin group; and ICH + 50 mg/kg quercetin group. The expression levels of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α in the brain tissue were assayed by Real-time PCR, ELISA and Western Blot, and cell apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL and caspase-3 staining 3 days after model establishment. It was found that the lesion volume, the brain water content, the expression levels of the four inflammation markers and the number of apoptotic cells were reduced significantly in ICH rats receiving quercetin, especially in 50 mg/kg quercetin group. These results confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in repairing brain injury, probably by inhibiting inflammatory response and apoptosis, thus promoting nerve functional restoration."

The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of fingolimod in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage. ICH was produced in adult CD1 mice by injecting collagenase VII-S (0.5 µL, 0.06 U) into the basal ganglia. Fingolimod (or saline) was given 30 min after surgery and once daily for two days. Three days after intracerebral hemorrhage, brain edema, hematoma volume and the number of apoptotic cells were quantified. In another cohort of mice, brain atrophy was evaluated two weeks following intracerebral hemorrhage. Neurobehavioral tests were performed on the 3rd, the 7th and the 14th day. Fingolimod significantly decreased edema, apoptosis and brain atrophy. More importantly, fingolimod enhanced neurobehavioral recovery. Preliminary experiments showed no difference in the number of inflammatory (CD68-positive) cells between the two groups. In conclusion, fingolimod exerts protective effects in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage; the mechanisms underlying these neuroprotective effects deserve further study."

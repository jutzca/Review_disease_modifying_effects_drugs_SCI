In this study, less extensive surgical lesions were combined with the most favorable drug treatment (75 mg per kilogram of cyclophosphamide in a single dose) in an effort to improve the prospects for regeneration. Less than complete spinal cord transections in the rat were frequently followed by clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of return of function. Such return of function appears to depend on a reorganization of the nervous system that results in the use of the few remaining fibers to transmit motor information rather than on regeneration. Immunosuppressive treatment had no effect on these results."

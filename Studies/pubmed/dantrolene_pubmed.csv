Riluzole and dantrolene have been shown to provide neuroprotection by reducing neuronal apoptosis after brain and spinal cord injury (SCI) in several animal models of neurologic disorders. As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we investigated the cumulative effects of riluzole and dantrolene. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of the combined administration of riluzole and dantrolene in experimental thoracic SCI. Twenty-nine Wistar rats were laminectomized at T12 and divided in five groups. Rats in GI (n=6) underwent laminectomy alone and were treated with placebo. Rats in GII (n=6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with placebo. Rats in GIII (n=5) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with riluzole and placebo 15 minutes and 1 hour after laminectomy, respectively. Rats in GIV (n=6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with placebo and dantrolene 15 minutes and 1 hour after laminectomy, respectively. Rats in GV (n=6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and were treated with riluzole and dantrolene 15 minutes and 1 hour after laminectomy, respectively. A compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. Behavioral testing of hind limb function was performed using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, which revealed significant recovery in the group treated with the association of riluzole and dantrolene compared with other groups. After euthanasia, the spinal cord was evaluated using light microscopy and immunochemistry with anti-NeuN and transferase dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. Animals treated with the association of riluzole and dantrolene showed a larger number of NeuN-positive neurons adjacent to the epicenter of injury (p≤.05). Furthermore, the TUNEL staining was similar between animals treated with riluzole and dantrolene and those that did not receive spinal cord trauma (p>.05). These results showed that riluzole and dantrolene have a synergistic effect in neuroprotection after traumatic SCI by decreasing apoptotic cell death."

We used 25 rats (Rattus norvegicus) that were divided into five groups. The negative control group (NC) consisted of animals without spinal cord trauma. In the groups with spinal cord trauma, the positive control group (PC) was given no treatment, the MS group was treated with methylprednisolone, the MS/DS group was treated with methylprednisolone and dantrolene, and the DS group was treated with dantrolene alone. The animals' motor function was evaluated daily, as measured with the open field test. Eight days after surgery, the animals were euthanized for spinal cord collection. Descriptive morphological evaluation, anti-NeuN immunohistochemistry, TUNEL, and anti-Bax immunofluorescence were performed. There was no significant difference between the PC, MS, MS/DS and DS groups with respect to BBB scores, neuronal and glial staining, or Bax expression (P < 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that methylprednisolone sodium succinate, dantrolene sodium, or the combination of these drugs did not reduce neuronal and glial loss, intrinsic pathway apoptosis, or promote functional recovery."

A 52-year-old man treated with oral dantrolene for spasticity after spinal cord injury was scheduled to undergo irrigation and drainage of a thigh abscess under general anesthesia. He had taken 50 mg oral dantrolene per day for 3 years. Under standard neuromuscular monitoring, anesthesia was performed with propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of ED95 (0.3 mg/kg) of rocuronium could not depress T1 up to 95%. An additional dose of rocuronium depressed T1 completely and decreased the train-of-four (TOF) count to zero. There was no apparent prolongation of the neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium. The TOF ratio was recovered to more than 0.9 within 40 minutes after the last dose of rocuronium. A small dose of oral dantrolene does not prolong the duration of action and recovery of rocuronium."

He had bilateral basal lung collapse and a raised diaphragm and was on high-dose oral dantrolene. The cessation of dantrolene resulted in a dramatic recovery of respiratory function within two days. High-dose oral dantrolene can cause severe respiratory insufficiency and may present difficulties in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries."

We examined the effects of traumatic compressive injury on (Ca2+)i dynamics in spinal cord white matter. We conducted electrophysiological studies with ryanodine and inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) receptor agonists and antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury (SCI). A 25-30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber (37 degrees C) and injured with a modified clip (2-g closing force) for 15 sec. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential (CAP) with glass microelectrodes. The CAP decreased to 55.2+/-6.8% of control (p < 0.05) after spinal cord injury (SCI). Chelation of Ca2+i with BAPTA-AM (a high-affinity calcium chelator) promoted significantly greater recovery of CAP amplitude (83.2+/-4.2% of control; p < 0.05) after injury. Infusion of caffeine (1 and 10 mM) exacerbated CAP amplitude decline (45.1+/-5.9% of control; p < 0.05; 44.6+/-3.1% of control; p < 0.05) postinjury. Blockade of Ca2+i release through ryanodine-sensitive receptors (RyRs) with dantrolene (10 microM) and ryanodine (50 microM), conferred significant (p < 0.05) improvement in CAP amplitude after injury. On the other hand, blockade of Ca2+i with inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate receptor (IP3Rs) blocker 2APB (10 microM) also conferred significant improvement in CAP amplitude after injury (82.9+/-7.9%; p < 0.05). In conclusion, the injurious effects of Ca2+i in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) white matter injury appear to be mediated both by RyRs and through IP3Rs calcium-induced calcium release receptors (CICRs)."

To a certain extent, increased autophagy has a protective effect on neurons. Early hormone therapy is well recognized as a treatment for spinal cord injury. However, whether the protective effect of autophagy is important in recovery from spinal cord injury remains unclear. In this study, we established an in-vitro model of spinal cord injury to study the effects of dexamethasone on mechanical injury, autophagy, and apoptosis in spinal cord neurons. The results showed that dexamethasone inhibited the level of autophagy in the injured nerve cells in a dose-dependent manner. High doses of dexamethasone protected the damaged spinal cord neurons by inhibiting apoptosis, but a protective effect from low hormone concentrations was not obvious. When autophagy was inhibited in damaged spinal cord neurons, apoptosis decreased significantly; in contrast, impairment of autophagy-induced activation of spinal cord neurons and apoptosis levels were significantly increased."

We conducted a retrospective review of 12 patients (male=10, female=2) who presented with spinal cord symptoms. We investigated their clinical features, neurological findings and radiologic findings. The depth and bottom time of the dive were 34.5 meters (range 22-56) and 22.7 minutes (range 10-55) respectively. Most divers ascended within appropriate time frame as shown by the decompression tables. The most frequent initial symptoms were lower limb weakness (n=12), followed by sensory disturbances (n=10) and bladder dysfuction (n=5). The chief radiologic abnormalities were continuous (n=3), or non-continuous (n=5) high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images at posterior paramedian portion of the spinal cord, mainly thoracic level. There were no abnormal findings in the remaining four (4) patients, and they showed good prognosis. All patients were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and some received high-dose dexamethasone. On discharge, five (5) patients had made a full recovery, seven (7) had some residual neurological sequelae, and all patients except one (1) regained normal bladder function. Spinal cord decompression sickness is a neurological emergency. Early recognition and treatment may minimize neurological damage. Initial normal finding in MR imaging was a good predictor for prognosis in spinal decompression sickness."

In this study, the authors evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive medications on neurite outgrowth and cell survival after a pharmacologically induced injury. Differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were injured using the calcium agonist thapsigargin. After cellular injury, neurite outgrowth in the presence or absence of immunosuppressive agents was measured. Apoptosis was quantified with the aid of a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay. Neurite outgrowth was severely restricted following thapsigargin injury. Outgrowth was potentiated, however, by the addition of concentrations of 1 and 10 mM cyclosporin A in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, addition of 10 nM FK506 increased the percentage of neurites in the 20- to 40-micron range. A low dose (1 mM) of dexamethasone did not have a significant effect on neurite outgrowth, but a higher dose (10 mM) increased the percentage of neurites in the 10- to 45-micron range. These agents also lessened the degree of thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and dexamethasone can potentiate neurite outgrowth and protect against apoptotic cell death in a human postmitotic neuronal cell line. Such effects may have implications for lessening neuronal injury after neurotrauma, stroke, or neurodegeneration."

Furthermore, the different functional recovery between treated and non-treated animals was recorded. Although the administration of dexamethasone showed a beneficial effect on the functional recovery of the animals, the tissue expression of VPF after SCI is not influenced by dexamethasone administration. Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of the dexamethasone after experimental SCI is not mediated through an interference on the biological effects of the 165-aa vascular permeability factor."

While several mechanisms were proposed to account for these effects, limited information exists regarding GC actions in sensory areas of the spinal cord. Presently, we studied the time course of Fos expression, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical staining to monitor neuronal responses to SCI with or without GC treatment. Rats with sham-operation or transection at the thoracic level (T7-T8) received vehicle or 5 mg/kg of the GC dexamethasone (DEX) at 5 min post-lesion and were sacrificed 2 or 4 h after surgery. Another group of SCI rats received vehicle or intensive DEX treatment (5 min, 6 h, 18 h and 46 h post-lesion) and were sacrificed 48 h after surgery. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons or Fos immunoreactive nuclei was studied by computer-assisted image analysis in superficial dorsal horn (Laminae I-III) and central canal area (Lamina X) below the lesion. While constitutive Fos immunoreactive nuclei were sparse in controls, SCI increased Fos expression at 2 and 4 h after injury. DEX treatment significantly enhanced the number of Fos positive nuclei in Laminae I-III by 4 h after transection, although the response was not maintained by intensive steroid treatment when tested at 48 h after SCI. NADPH-d positive neurons in Laminae I-III increased at 2 and 4 h after SCI while a delayed increased was found in central canal area (Lamina X). DEX treatment decreased NADPH-d positive neurons to sham-operated levels at all time points examined. Thus, while GC stimulation of Fos suggests activation of neurons involved in sympathetic outflow and/or pain, down-regulation of NADPH-d indicates attenuation of nociceptive outflow, considering the role of enzyme-derived nitric oxide in pain-related mechanisms. Differential hormonal effects on these molecules agree with their localization in different cell populations."

SCI induces the expression of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), that in the absence of the high affinity component, TrkA, can promote cell death by apoptosis. We therefore hypothesized that a reduction of p75NTR expression in SCI may increase tissue sparing and therefore improve recovery of function. As a tool to test our hypothesis we used the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) to down-regulate p75NTR expression. A standardized thoracic spinal cord contusion injury was produced in female rats. Laminectomized and SCI rats received various doses of DEX immediately after injury and the treatment was continued daily for 7 days. DEX, given at high doses (20 mg/kg, s.c.) but not at low doses (1 or 8 mg/kg) prevented the increase in p75NTR mRNA and protein in SCI rats, without affecting the expression of TrkA. High doses of DEX also reduced cellular apoptosis both in white and gray matters. This effect correlated with the ability of DEX to accelerate behavioral recovery of function measured by a combined behavioral score. These data suggest that reduction of p75NTR in SCI may be a therapeutic strategy to limit cell and tissue damage and therefore to improve recovery of function in SCI patients."

For the first time, similar methodology also has been applied to study the effects of hypothermia. Canine spinal cords were injured at T13 by use of an epidural balloon and then were treated with local hypothermia or intramuscular dexamethasone or both. Motor recovery was assessed using a modified Tarlov scale. At either 6 days or 7 weeks, spinal cords T8 through L4 were removed and divided into 10 ordered blocks, which were analyzed for wet and dry weight, potassium concentration, and sodium concentration. Correlations between clinical motor and chemical results were evaluated. The conclusions drawn are as follows: 1) The canine severe rapid compressive injury model, unlike the previously published less severe feline impact injury model, is not associated with widespread early loss of spinal cord tissue potassium content (dry weight). 2) The dog compressive model, unlike the cat impact model, does not provide evidence that one fundamental mechanism of the confirmed beneficial action of steroids entails enhanced early preservation of tissue potassium content. 3) At 6 days, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and increase in sodium concentration, representing edema, occurred at and adjacent to the direct compression site in all lesioned dog groups except those treated with dexamethasone, demonstrating an antiedema effect of dexamethasone that was nullified by concurrent local hypothermia. 4) This antiedema effect of dexamethasone was associated with superior early motor improvement but did not lead to superior long-term function, in comparison with hypothermia. 5) At 7 weeks, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and potassium concentration, and increase in sodium concentration, all restricted to the directly compressed segment, signify necrosis. 6) This new chemical index of necrosis was highly correlated with clinical motor performance."

Primary data publications using high dose steroids given within 12 h following spinal cord injury and reporting outcome measures separately for steroid and non-steroid treated groups were selected. Evaluation followed the guides of Guyatt et al7 (for the Evidence Based Working Group in Canada). Studies with questionable validity were excluded. Level of evidence and treatment recommendation utilised the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination criteria.6 Experimental spinal cord injury studies on larger animals were included; small mammal experiments were considered beyond evaluation. Three clinical trials and six cohort study publications were found to satisfy the review criteria. The evidence they provide supports 'the recommendation that the manoeuvre (high dose methylpredisolone) be excluded from consideration as an intervention for the condition'10 (acute spinal cord injury). Twelve larger animal publications were detailed. Validity and the functional significance of results was of concern in many. The weight of evidence lay with those studies demonstrating no definite effect of MPSS on functional outcome. In cat experiments with higher level cord damage, deaths in the MPSS treated groups were notable. The evidence produced by this systematic review does not support the use of high dose methylprednisolone in acute spinal cord injury to improve neurological recovery. A deleterious effect on early mortality and morbidity cannot be excluded by this evidence."

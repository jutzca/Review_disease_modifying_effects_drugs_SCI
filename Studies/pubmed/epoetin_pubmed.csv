We aimed to evaluate the effect of rhEPO plus methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) compared to MPSS alone to improve neurological function of patients after SCI in a randomized clinical trial. During a 15-month period 30 patients presenting to emergency departments of two university affiliated hospitals within less than 6 hours after acute SCI were randomized to two groups. Both groups received MPSS 30 mg/kg initially and 5.4 mg/kg every hour till 23 hours if admitted within 3 hours and till 47 hours if recruited within 3-6 hours after injury. Group EPO also received 500 unit/kg rhEPO on admission and another 500 unit/kg 24 hours later instead of placebo in group MPSS. Neurologic evaluation was performed on admission, 24, 48, 72 hours and one and 6 months later. Range of patients' age was 18-65 years. There was no significant difference between patients receiving two types of treatment in neurological exam on admission (P=0.125), 24 hours after admission (P=0.108) and 48 hours after admission (P=0.085). However, one week (P=0.046), one month (P=0.021) and six months (P=0.018) after admission these differences were significant. MPSS plus rhEPO started within 6 hours after acute spinal injury may be more effective than MPSS plus placebo in improvement of neurologic dysfunction. More studies with larger sample sizes are warranted."

We investigated whether EPO has a neuroprotective effect against ISCI in rats and examined the involvement of CREB protein phosphorylation in this process. Spinal cord ischemia was produced by balloon occlusion of the abdominal aorta below the branching point of the left subclavian artery for 5 minutes, and rHu-EPO (1000 U/kg BW) was administered intravenously after the onset of the reperfusion. Neurologic status was assessed at 1, 24, and, 48 hours. After the end of 48 hours, spinal cords were harvested for histopathologic analysis and immunohistochemistry for pCREB. All sham-operated rats had a normal neurologic outcome, whereas all ischemic rats suffered severe neurologic deficits after ISCI. Erythropoietin treatment was found to accelerate recovery of motor deficits and prevent the loss of motoneurons in the spinal cord after transient ischemia. Ischemic spinal cord injury induced the phosphorylation of pCREB at the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and EPO treatment significantly potentiated expression of pCREB increase at the anterior horn of the spinal cord. These results demonstrate that a single dose of EPO given before ISCI provides significant neuroprotection and potentiates the expression of pCREB in this region."

Patients with SCI usually exhibit severe clinical symptoms, including sensory and motor dysfunction below the injured levels, paraplegia, quadriplegia and urinary retention, which can exacerbate the substantial medical and social burdens. The major pathological change observed in SCI is inflammatory reaction, which induces demyelination, axonal degeneration, and the apoptosis and necrosis of neurons. Traditional medical treatments are mainly focused on the recovery of motor function and prevention of complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of SCI and have proposed lots of effective treatments, but the clinical applications are still limited due to the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis after SCI. Endocrine hormones are kinds of molecules that are synthesized by specialized endocrine organs and can participate in the regulation of multiple physiological activities, and their protective effects on several disorders have been widely discussed. In addition, many studies have identified that endocrine hormones can promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery in individuals with central nervous system diseases. Therefore, studies investigating the clinical applications of endocrine hormones as treatments for SCI are necessary. In this review, we described the neuroprotective roles of several endocrine hormones in SCI; endocrine hormone administration reduces cell death and promotes functional repair after SCI. We also proposed novel therapies for SCI."

Inclusion of both sexes when modeling neurotrauma is leading to the identification of novel areas for therapeutic and scientific exploitation. Here, we review the organizational and activational effects of sex hormones on recovery from injury and how these changes impact the long-term health of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. When determining how sex affects SCI it remains imperative to expand outcomes beyond locomotor recovery and consider other complications plaguing the quality of life of patients with SCI. Interestingly, the SCI field predominately utilizes female rodents for basic science research which contrasts most other male-biased research fields. We discuss the unique caveats this creates to the translatability of preclinical research in the SCI field. We also review current clinical and preclinical data examining sex as biological variable in SCI. Further, we report how technical considerations such as housing, size, care management, and age, confound the interpretation of sex-specific effects in animal studies of SCI. We have uncovered novel findings regarding how age differentially affects mortality and injury-induced anemia in males and females after SCI, and further identified estrus cycle dysfunction in mice after injury. Emerging concepts underlying sexually dimorphic responses to therapy are also discussed. Through a combination of literature review and primary research observations we present a practical guide for considering and incorporating sex as biological variable in preclinical neurotrauma studies."

A 25-mer peptide comprising the ED of MARCKS stimulates neuritogenesis of primary hippocampal neurons after addition to the culture. This motivated us to investigate whether ED peptide has similar effects in spinal cord injury. ED peptide supported recovery and regrowth of monoaminergic axons in female, but not in male mice. Sex-specific differences in response to ED peptide application also occurred in cultured neurons. In female but not male neurons, the ED peptide enhanced neurite outgrowth that could be suppressed by inhibitors of the estrogen receptors α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, protein kinase C, and matrix metalloproteinase 2. In addition, we observed female-specific elevation of phosphorylated MARCKS levels after ED peptide treatment. In male neurons, the ED peptide enhanced neuritogenesis in the presence of an androgen receptor inhibitor to the extent seen in ED peptide-treated female neurons. However, inhibition of androgen receptor did not lead to increased phosphorylation of MARCKS. These results provide insights into the functions of a novel compound contributing to gender-dependent regeneration."

The ensuing reactive gliosis, inflammatory cascade, and glial scar formation impede axonal regrowth. Although systemic anti-inflammatory agents (steroids) have been previously administered to counteract this, no current therapeutic is approved for post-injury neuronal regeneration, in part because of related side effects. Likewise, therapeutic systemic estrogen levels exhibit neuroprotective properties, but dose-dependent side effects are prohibitive. The current study thus uses low-dose estrogen delivery to the spinal cord injury (SCI) site using an agarose gel patch embedded with estrogen-loaded nanoparticles. Compared to controls, spinal cords from rodents treated with nanoparticle site-directed estrogen demonstrated significantly decreased post-injury lesion size, reactive gliosis, and glial scar formation. However, axonal regeneration, vascular endothelial growth factor production, and glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor levels were increased with estrogen administration. Concomitantly improved locomotor and bladder functional recovery were observed with estrogen administration after injury. Therefore, low-dose site-directed estrogen may provide a future approach for enhanced neuronal repair and functional recovery in SCI patients."

This could be due to the enormous innervation of the spinocerebellar tract from the posterior gray horn in the spinal cord to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Although the neuroprotective role of estradiol in spinal cord (SC) injuries, as well as its ability to delay secondary cell death changes, is well-known, its effect on cerebellar layers is not fully investigated. In this study, a SCI model was achieved by injection of Kainic acid into SC of adult Male Wistar rats in order to assess the effects of SCI on the cerebellum. The animals were classified into SCI group (animals with SCI), estradiol-treated group (animals with SCI and received estradiol), control groups, and sham control group. The microscopical examination 24 h after induction of SCI revealed that KA induced the most characteristics of neurodegeneration including astrocytic propagation and microglial activation. The estradiol was injected intraperitoneally 20 min after induction of SCI, and the samples were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days. Histologically, the estradiol reduced the inflammatory response, enhanced the recovery of molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell layers, and therefore aided in the restoration of layer organization. These findings were also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and gene expression profiling."

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone."

The promotion of angiogenesis after SCI may be a therapeutic target in the treatment of SCI. Estrogen has been reported to improve locomotor recovery after SCI. However, how estrogen regulates angiogenesis in acute SCI and enhances neurological functional recovery has not been fully characterized. Synchrotron radiation imaging combined with histological methods was used to image angiogenesis in acute spinal cord treatment with estrogen in rats. Synchrotron radiation imaging vividly demonstrated three-dimensional vessel changes in the spinal cord after injury. The imaging showed that vessel number, vessel volume fraction, and vessel connectivity value in the groups treated with estrogen after SCI were significantly increased compared to control groups (P < 0.05). Vessel angiogenesis increased in groups treated with estrogen compared with control rats, which was confirmed with histological staining. Estrogen treatment also attenuated the injury-induced lesion area compared with control groups and improved locomotor functional recovery after SCI. The results indicated that synchrotron radiation is a powerful imaging tool for visualizing angiogenesis after acute SCI. Estrogen treatment exerted a neuroprotective effect on acute SCI treatment by promoting angiogenesis and reducing the injury-induced lesion area could be recommended as a potential preclinical treatment approach for acute SCI.

Tamoxifen exerts beneficial effects in male and female rodents but a gap of knowledge exists on: the therapeutic window of TAM, the spatio-temporal mechanisms activated and if this response is sexually dimorphic. We hypothesized that TAM will favor locomotor recovery when administered up-to 24h after SCI in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received a thoracic (T10) contusion using the MACSIS impactor followed by placebo or TAM (15mg/21days) pellets in a therapeutic window of 0, 6, 12, or 24h. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, 28 or 35days post injury (DPI) to study the molecular and cellular changes in the acute and chronic stages. Immediate or delayed therapy (t=6h) improved locomotor function, increased white matter spared tissue, and neuronal survival. TAM reduced reactive gliosis during chronic stages and increased the expression of Olig-2. A significant difference was observed in estrogen receptor alpha between male and female rodents from 2 to 28 DPI suggesting a sexually dimorphic characteristic that could be related to the behavioral differences observed in the therapeutic window of TAM. This study supports the use of TAM in the SCI setting due to its neuroprotective effects but with a significant sexually dimorphic therapeutic window."

SRC-1 is an essential initiation factor for the estrogen-regulated target gene transcription and plays a key role in regulating estrogen activity. However, it is not known whether and how SRC-1 mediates the neural regeneration promoted by estrogen after SCI. Study of the sex differences and changes of SRC-1 expression after SCI will be helpful to understand the above questions. In this study, the sex differences of expressions of SRC-1 and cytoskeleton-associated protein Profilin-1 in normal and SCI mice were detected by immunohistochemistry at 1-, 3-, and 7 days after injury, respectively. Although the SRC-1 expression in female mice was lower than that in males under normal conditions, its expression in females was more dominant after SCI. The expression of Profilin-1 in both sexes increased first, and then decreased at 3 days after injury. However, there was a second increase in females at 7 days after injury. Our study suggests that the more SRC-1 expression in females after SCI may play a role in improving the efficiency of estrogen function and thus, promote regeneration better. SRC-1 may also participate in the regulation of Profilin-1 in spinal cord, which is important in the assembly and extension of the axonal cytoskeleton during regeneration after SCI."

The inflammatory response initiated by spinal cord injury (SCI) involves the processing of interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and IL-18 mediated by caspase-1 which is under the control of an intracellular multiprotein complex called inflammasome. We recently described in a SCI model that between 24 and 72 h post-injury, most of inflammasome components including IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 are upregulated. In this study, we investigated the influence of E2 treatment after spinal cord contusion on inflammasome regulation. After contusion of T9 spinal segment, 12-week-old male Wistar rats were treated subcutaneously with E2 immediately after injury and every 12 h for the next 3 days. Behavioral scores were significantly improved in E2-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated groups. Functional improvement in E2-treated animals was paralleled by the attenuated expression of certain inflammasome components such as ASC, NLRP1b, and NLRP3 together with IL1b, IL-18, and caspase-1. On the histopathological level, microgliosis and oligodendrocyte injury was ameliorated. These findings support and extend the knowledge of the E2-mediated neuroprotective function during SCI. The control of the inflammasome machinery by E2 might be a missing piece of the puzzle to understand the anti-inflammatory potency of E2."

Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment.

In the present study, we investigated the role of a newly found membrane ER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPR30 or GPER1), and discussed the feasibility of a GPR30 agonist as an estrogen replacement. Forty adult female C57BL/6J mice (10-12 weeks old) were divided randomly into vehicle, G-1, E2, G-1 + G-15 and E2 + G-15 groups. All mice were subjected to SCI using a crushing injury approach. The specific GPR30 agonist, G-1, mimicked the effects of E2 treatment by preventing SCI-induced apoptotic cell death and enhancing motor functional recovery after injury. GPR30 activation regulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways, increased GPR30 and anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but decreased the pro-apoptosis factor Bax and cleaved caspase-3. However, the neuroprotective effects of G-1 and E2 were blocked by the specific GPR30 antagonist, G-15. Thus, GPR30 rather than classic ERs is required to induce estrogenic neuroprotective effects. Given that estrogen replacement therapy may cause unexpected side effects, especially on the reproductive system, GPR30 agonists may represent a potential therapeutic approach for treating SCI."

We herein demonstrate increased neural input onto spinal neurons caudal to the lesion in spinal cord injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice as indicated by increased levels of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) compared to controls. Axonal sparing, long-range axonal regeneration and reactive sprouting were investigated as possible explanations for the increase in neural inputs caudal to the lesion and for the improved locomotor outcomes in spinal cord-injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice. Whereas retrograde tract-tracing studies failed to reveal any evidence for increased axonal sparing or for long-range regeneration in the Sox9 conditional knock out mice, anterograde tract-tracing experiments demonstrated increased reactive sprouting caudal to the lesion after SCI. Finally we demonstrate that application of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor to reduce CSPG degradation in Sox9 conditional knock out mice prevents the improvements in locomotor recovery observed in untreated Sox9 conditional knock out mice. These results suggest that improved recovery of locomotor function in Sox9 conditional knock out mice after SCI is due to increased reactive sprouting secondary to reduced CSPG levels distal to the lesion."

Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 μg 17β-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c)."

In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance: age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male. By deepening our understanding of why a gender advantage exists, potential new therapeutics can be designed to improve recovery for the male population following the initial trauma or putatively augment the neuroprotective privilege in females for enhanced outcomes."

The only treatment currently available is methylprednisolone, which is widely used and renders limited efficacy in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be developed. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 μg/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 μg was found to be as effective as 100 μg in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes. Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury. Studies are underway in chronic SCI in a follow up manuscript."

The estrogen group was treated with intramuscular injection of 100 µg/kg estrogen every day till the death of animal models, while the simple injury group was treated with intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL saline every day. Then these animals were put to death in the 1st d, 3rd d, 5th d, 8th d, 14th d and 21st d after SCI respectively and tissue sections were prepared, followed by B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) detection, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and detection of the cell apoptosis in animal models after SCI. In the 14th d after the injury of spinal cord nervous system, Gale grading and inclined plate maintenance tests were carried out. In the 1st d after SCI, there was a higher expression of Bcl-2 protein in the SCI tissues. Bcl-2 protein reached the peak in the 3rd d after SCI in the simple injured group, while the estrogen group reached the peak in the 8th d. At that time, Bcl-2 protein was both expressed in nerve cells, and in glial cells in a higher level. The expression began to decline in the 14th d after SCI, and with only a little expression in the 21st d after SCI (p<0.05). TUNEL detection results showed that, positive cells dominated by glial cells emerged in simple injured group only 24th h later; they reached the peak after 3~8 days, and then began to reduce. In the 21st d, positive cells still existed, and there was less cell apoptosis after treated with estrogen (p<0.05). Two weeks after SCI, Gale score and inclined plate maintenance rate were higher in the estrogen group than in the simple injured group (p<0.01). Adverse effects that occurred in injury group included blood dryness, necrosis, cyst cavity and cavity, while in estrogen group, adverse effects included focal bleeding, hydropic degeneration of neuron, disappearance of partial nissl bodies and neuraxial edema. All these findings suggest that, estrogen used for treating SCI can effectively inhibit the apoptosis of early nerve cells and glial cells in injured spinal cord nervous system by improving the micro-circulation, enhancing the expression of Bcl-2 protein, removing the free radicals and inhibiting the antioxidation. Thus, it can reduce the secondary SCI and promote the recovery of injured spinal cord nervous functions."

This scar contains reactive astrocytes, activated microglia, macrophages and other myeloid cells, meningeal cells, proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and a dense extracellular matrix. Whether the scar is beneficial or detrimental to recovery remains controversial. In the acute phase of recovery, scar-forming astrocytes limit the invasion of leukocytes and macrophages, but in the subacute and chronic phases of injury the glial scar is a physical and biochemical barrier to axonal regrowth. The signals that initiate the formation of the glial scar are unknown. Both canonical and noncanonical signaling Wnts are increased after spinal cord injury (SCI). Because Wnts are important regulators of OPC and oligodendrocyte development, we examined the role of canonical Wnt signaling in the glial reactions to CNS injury. In adult female mice carrying an OPC-specific conditionally deleted β-catenin gene, there is reduced proliferation of OPCs after SCI, reduced accumulation of activated microglia/macrophages, and reduced astrocyte hypertrophy. Using an infraorbital optic nerve crush injury, we show that reducing β-catenin-dependent signaling in OPCs creates an environment that is permissive to axonal regeneration. Viral-induced expression of Wnt3a in the normal adult mouse spinal cord induces an injury-like response in glia. Thus canonical Wnt signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce injury responses among glial cells. These data suggest that targeting Wnt expression after SCI may have therapeutic potential in promoting axon regeneration."

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-α mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-α antagonist. We also observed that ER-α was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-α. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-α dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen׳s effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition."

Immediate treatment with diarylpropionitrile (DPN), a non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor ß ligand, resulted in a significant increase in Nrf2 levels, and reduction of inflammation and apoptosis compared to untreated SCI animals. Furthermore, DPN-treatment improved locomotor function within 7 days after induction of SCI. DPN acted through activation of PI3K/ Akt pathway, known to be involved in down-regulation of apoptosis and up-regulation of cell survival in injured tissues.

In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females. Similar controversy exists clinically, in studies that have examined gender disparities in outcome after SCI. The current review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for a gender bias in outcome following SCI and discusses issues that have made it difficult to conclusively answer this question."

AQP4 increases in TMX-treated SCI rats were associated with smaller fluid-filled cavities with borders consisting of densely packed AQP4-expressing astrocytes that closely resemble the organization of normal glia limitans externa (in contrast to large cavities in control SCI rats that lacked glia limitans-like borders and contained reactive glial cells).

Control and Sox9 conditional knock-out mice were subject to a 70 kdyne contusion spinal cord injury at thoracic level 9. One week after injury, Sox9 conditional knock-out mice expressed reduced levels of CSPG biosynthetic enzymes (Xt-1 and C4st), CSPG core proteins (brevican, neurocan, and aggrecan), collagens 2a1 and 4a1, and Gfap, a marker of astrocyte activation, in the injured spinal cord compared with controls. These changes in gene expression were accompanied by improved hind limb function and locomotor recovery as evaluated by the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) and rodent activity boxes. Histological assessments confirmed reduced CSPG deposition and collagenous scarring at the lesion of Sox9 conditional knock-out mice, and demonstrated increased neurofilament-positive fibers in the lesion penumbra and increased serotonin immunoreactivity caudal to the site of injury.

Here, we demonstrated that 17β-estradiol attenuates apoptosis of oligodendrocytes by inhibiting RhoA and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation after SCI. Estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β were expressed in oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord, and 17β-estradiol treatment significantly inhibited oligodendrocyte cell death at 7 d after injury as compared with vehicle (cyclodextrin) control. 17β-Estradiol also attenuated caspase-3 and -9 activation at 7 d and reduced the loss of axons from progressive degeneration.

Furthermore, administration of Rho inhibitor, PEP-1-C3 exoenzyme, inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, and decreased phosphorylated c-Jun level at 5 d after injury. Additionally, the attenuation of RhoA and JNK3 activation as well as oligodendrocyte cell death by 17β-estradiol was reversed by ER antagonist, ICI182780. Our results thus indicate that 17β-estradiol treatment improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing oligodendrocyte cell death via inhibition of RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were ER dependent.

Numerous strategies are being implemented to protect neurons from damage, to enhance axon growth and to foster cell proliferation. Described in this report are recent clinical trials aimed at testing strategies to restore locomotion after SCI. While laboratory animal studies have indicated that it may be possible to minimize neuronal damage resulting from spinal cord injury, little progress has been made in reducing or reversing the events associated with the chronic phase of this condition. The strategy aiming to inhibit single molecule sometimes shows controversial results. In SCI, a lot of players participate in motor and sensory dysfunctions. Therefore, sufficient functional recovery may be achieved by regulating multiple targets. Regrowth of tracts connecting the brain and spinal cord, and axonal sprouting of propriospinal interneurons are fundamentally important for neuronal network working. In addition, remyelination, protection of neuronal death, inhibition of inflammation, and upregulation of beneficial influence of astrocytes are also quite crucial to supporting the axonal refining. Combination of several strategies might be useful as a practical therapy. Several compounds such as a Sema3A inhibitor, estrogen, withanoside IV and their relating compounds or other neurotrophic factor-mimicking agents may be candidates for useful SCI therapeutic drugs since those have multi-effects on damaged spinal cord.

Spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy. To gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of E2, the following end points of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) expression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and COX-2; (4) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression); and (5) tissue TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels. In another set of experiments, the pretreatment or posttreatment with E2 significantly ameliorates the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of E2 were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of E2. ICI 182,780 (500 microg/kg, s.c., 1 h before treatment with E2) significantly antagonized the effect of the E2 and abolished the protective effect against SCI. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that administration of E2 before SCI reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma."

Recent epidemiological trends suggest that SCIs in elderly women are increasing; however, the effects of menopause on estrogen-mediated neuroprotection are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17beta-estradiol and reproductive aging on motor function, neuronal death, and white matter sparing after SCI of post- and pre-menopausal rats. Two-month-old or 1- year-old female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with a silastic capsule containing 180 microg/mL of 17beta-estradiol or vehicle. Complete crush SCI at T8-9 was performed 1 week later. Additional animals of each age group were left ovary-intact but were spinal cord injured. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor test was performed. Spinal cords were collected on post-SCI days 1, 7, and 21, and processed for histological markers. Administration of 17beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats improved recovery of hind-limb locomotion, increased white matter sparing, and decreased apoptosis in both the post- and pre-menopausal rats. Also, ovary-intact 1-year-old rats did worse than ovary-intact 2-month-old rats, suggesting that endogenous estrogen confers neuroprotection in young rats, which is lost in older animals. Taken together, these data suggest that estrogen is neuroprotective in SCI and that the loss of endogenous estrogen-mediated neuroprotective seen in older rats can be attenuated with exogenous administration of 17beta-estradiol."

We intended to assess effects of gender on recovery of hindlimb motor function and to correlate these with histomorphologic profiles of injured spinal cord tissue. Locomotor function was evaluated by three means: a modified locomotor scoring system for rodents, beam walking and computerized activity meter. Histology was analyzed by comparison of hematoxylin and eosin-stained perfused specimens. Locomotor scores were 2.2+/-0.9 on day 1 in male mice, while, in contrast, they were significantly higher, 7.3+/-1.7, in females (P<0.02). On day 14 Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scores were 9.5+/-2.2 in male mice and 16.0+/-2.2 in females (P<0.03). Terminal histology showed that the spinal cord architecture was relatively better preserved in female mice and that the extent of necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells was less compared to males. Neurobiology Research Laboratory of University of Kansas Medical School in US Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri. We found that the severity of the initial injury as well as the ultimate recovery of motor function after SCI is significantly influenced by gender, being remarkably better in females. The mechanism(s) of neuroprotection in females, although not yet elucidated, may be associated with the effects of estrogen on pathophysiological processes (blood flow, leukocyte migration inhibition, antioxidant properties, and inhibition of apoptosis).

Improvement in American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor index score, ASIA Impairment Scale, level of injury, and FIM instrument scores after SCI. When examining subjects grouped by severity of injury, changes in ASIA motor index total scores, from system admission to 1-year anniversary, were significantly greater for women than men with either complete ( P =.035) or incomplete ( P =.031) injuries. Functional comparison of men and women, using the FIM motor subscale, revealed that men had higher FIM motor scores at rehabilitation discharge among those with motor-complete injuries, except for those with C1-4 and C6 neurologic levels. Women with motor-incomplete high tetraplegia (C1-4 levels) had higher discharge FIM motor scores than did similarly afflicted men. There were no significant differences in FIM motor scores among men and women with other levels of motor incomplete SCI. Gender differences in SCI were seen in several areas. Women may have more natural neurologic recovery than men; however, for a given level and degree of neurologic injury, men tend to do better functionally than women at time of discharge from rehabilitation. Future prospective study of the effects of estrogen on neurologic recovery and the effects of gender on functional potential are recommended."

We examined the protective effect of estrogen on functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. 17beta-estradiol (3, 100, or 300 microg/kg) was administered intravenously 1-2 h prior to injury (pre-treatment), and animals were then subjected to a mild, weight-drop spinal cord contusion injury. Estradiol treatment significantly improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Fifteen to 30 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in estradiol-treated (100 microg/kg) rats when compared to vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion sizes increased progressively in either vehicle-treated or 17beta-estradiol-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with 17beta-estradiol, the lesion size was significantly reduced 18-28 days after SCI when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis revealed that apoptotic cell death peaked 24-48 h after injury. Also, SCI induced a marked increase in activated caspase-3 in the spinal cord, evident by 4 h after injury. However, administration of 17beta-estradiol significantly reduced the SCI-induced increase in apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activity after SCI. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol significantly increased expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, bcl-2 and bcl-x, after SCI while expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, bad and bax, was not affected by drug treatment. Finally, intravenous administration of 17beta-estradiol (100 microg/kg) immediately after injury (post-treatment) also significantly improved hind limb motor function 19-30 days after SCI compared to vehicle-treated controls. These data suggest that after SCI, 17 beta-estradiol treatment improved functional recovery in the injured rat, in part, by reducing apoptotic cell death."

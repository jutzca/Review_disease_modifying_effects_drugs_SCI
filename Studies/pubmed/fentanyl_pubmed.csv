Because opioids are used in clinical anesthesia, the effect of an opiate antagonist was evaluated on neurologic outcome in a rat model of spinal cord injury occurring during opioid anesthesia. One day prior to spinal cord injury, a catheter was inserted into the spinal subarachnoid space with the tip at T8. On the day of spinal cord injury a balloon tipped catheter was inserted in the epidural space with the tip at the thoracolumbar junction. Spinal cord injury was produced by balloon inflation during one of the following states: 1) group 1 (A/S), injury was produced in awake rats and saline was administered in the subarachnoid space immediately following injury; 2) group 2 (F/S), injury was produced during a fentanyl/nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthetic, and subarachnoid saline administered; and 3) group 3 (F/Nx), injury was produced during a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, and subarachnoid naloxone (1 mg/kg) was administered immediately following injury. Dose-response curves describing the relationship between the duration of balloon inflation and the percentage of animals with a persistent neurologic deficit were constructed and compared for differences by use of a group t test. The duration of balloon inflation required to produce a neurologic deficit was greater in both the F/S and F/Nx groups than in the A/S group (P less than 0.05). There was no difference between the F/S and F/Nx groups. In summary, in rats receiving a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, neurologic outcome was improved compared with the awake state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Adult rats were implanted with various sizes of hygroscopic plastic material at the T12 spinal level to determine the dimensions that would produce a progressive neurologic deficit from which recovery could occur. Neurologic evaluation was conducted on an inclined plane, noting the maximum angle at which an animal was able to maintain orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal midline. Scores were statistically modeled for each group to develop profiles of neurologic deficits. Rats were subjected to a 4-h exposure to isoflurane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or ketamine 7 or 8 days postimplantation. Neurologic outcomes were compared to a SCI reference group which received no postimplant anesthesia. An animal weight/desiccated implant volume (Wa/Vi) ratio of 53 to 73 g/mm3 produced postimplant neurologic deficits which deteriorated to near maximum within 3 days, followed by a gradual improvement beginning at Day 8 and returning to near normal between 21 and 25 days. Final outcome was based on modeled ramp scores for each group and reported in degrees +/- SD: reference, 71.2 +/- 1.1; fentanyl/N2O, 70.4 +/- 0.3; isoflurane, 72.6 +/- 1.1; and ketamine, 64.9 +/- 0.6. The fentanyl group attained maximum recovery first (P > 0.05) but did not recover to a level different on the average from the reference group. The ketamine group demonstrated a poorer (P > 0.05) recovery level relative to the other anesthetic protocols."

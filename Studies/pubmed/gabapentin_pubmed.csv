While the development of novel compounds or cell-based interventions for spinal cord injury is unquestionably worthwhile, a complementary approach examines current standards of care and the degree to which these can be optimized to benefit long-term neurological function. Numerous classes of drugs, already in use in the acute phase of spinal cord injury, are intriguing because they (1) readily cross the blood-spinal cord barrier to modulate activity in the central nervous system and (2) are administered during a window of time in which neuroprotection, and even some repair, are feasible. Here, we review a rare case of convergent lines of evidence from both preclinical and human studies to support the early administration of a class of drug (ie, gabapentinoids) to both foster motor recovery and reduce the severity of neuropathic pain."

Here, we found that the α2δ2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels negatively regulates axon growth and regeneration of corticospinal neurons, the cells that originate the corticospinal tract. Increased α2δ2 expression in corticospinal neurons contributed to loss of corticospinal regrowth ability during postnatal development and after SCI. In contrast, α2δ2 pharmacological blockade through gabapentin administration promoted corticospinal structural plasticity and regeneration in adulthood. Using an optogenetic strategy combined with in vivo electrophysiological recording, we demonstrated that regenerating corticospinal axons functionally integrate into spinal circuits. Mice administered gabapentin recovered upper extremity function after cervical SCI. Importantly, such recovery relies on reorganization of the corticospinal pathway, as chemogenetic silencing of injured corticospinal neurons transiently abrogated recovery. Thus, targeting α2δ2 with a clinically relevant treatment strategy aids repair of motor circuits after SCI."

Symptoms are improved by movement. Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Lesion-related RLS has been reported, mainly in cases of stroke-related RLS involving the brainstem and lenticulostriate nuclei. Only few data of RLS in a context of spinal cord injury have been reported. We report the case of a woman with secondary RLS due to hemorrhage of a spinal cord cavernoma located at T9-T10. Following recovery from the acute phase of the hemorrhage, the patient began to complain about restlessness in her legs causing impaired sleep and daytime somnolence. Polysomnographic investigations found a high index of periodic leg movements during sleep (71/hour), but no sleep disordered breathing. Iron stores were normal. Relief of symptom's severity was obtained with gabapentin 600mg in the evening. We hypothesize a possible involvement of the diencephalospinal pathway in the patient's RLS pathophysiology. A systematic study of focal lesions associated with RLS may contribute to improving our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this condition. The frequency of RLS associated with lesions of the spinal cord might be underestimated. Clinicians should be aware of spinal cord lesion-related RLS, especially as efficient treatments are available."

To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 ± 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes. Early intervention with anticonvulsants may have effects beyond pain management and warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in human SCI."

SCI-induced neuropathic pain can be manifested as both tactile allodynia (a painful sensation to a non-noxious stimulus) and hyperalgesia (an enhanced sensation to a painful stimulus). The mechanisms underlying these pain states are poorly understood. Clinical studies have shown that gabapentin, a drug that binds to the voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-2-delta-1 subunit (Ca(v)α2δ-1) proteins is effective in the management of SCI-induced neuropathic pain. Accordingly, we hypothesized that tactile allodynia post SCI is mediated by an upregulation of Ca(v)α2δ-1 in dorsal spinal cord. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether SCI-induced dysregulation of spinal Ca(v)α2δ-1 plays a contributory role in below-level allodynia development in a rat spinal T9 contusion injury model. We found that Ca(v)α2δ-1 expression levels were significantly increased in L4-6 dorsal, but not ventral, spinal cord of SCI rats that correlated with tactile allodynia development in the hind paw plantar surface. Furthermore, both intrathecal gabapentin treatment and blocking SCI-induced Ca(v)α2δ-1 protein upregulation by intrathecal Ca(v)α2δ-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides could reverse tactile allodynia in SCI rats. These findings support that SCI-induced Ca(v)α2δ-1 upregulation in spinal dorsal horn is a key component in mediating below-level neuropathic pain states, and selectively targeting this pathway may provide effective pain relief for SCI patients. Spinal cord contusion injury caused increased calcium channel Ca(v)α2δ-1 subunit expression in dorsal spinal cord that contributes to neuropathic pain states."

In the present study, we examined their effects on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice subjected to weight-drop spinal cord injury. Hindlimb motor function and mechanical hypersensitivity were evaluated using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and the von Frey test, respectively, for 4 weeks after spinal cord injury. Despite gradual recovery of hindlimb motor function after spinal cord injury, mice exhibited continuous development of mechanical hypersensitivity. Gabapentin (30 and 100 mg/kg) and pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally on the 28th day after spinal cord injury, reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that gabapentin and pregabalin could be useful therapeutic tools for patients with neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury."

We present a recently developed SCI mammalian model of chronic central pain in which the spinal cord is contused at T8 using the NYU impactor device (10-g rod, 2.0-mm diameter, 12.5-mm drop height), an injury which is characterized behaviorally as moderate. Recovery of locomotor function was assessed with an open field test and scored using the open field test scale (BBB scale). Somatosensory tests of paw withdrawal responses accompanied by supraspinal responses to both mechanical punctate (von Frey hairs) and nonpunctate (4 mm diameter blunt probe) as well as thermal (radiant heat) peripheral stimuli were performed. Comparisons at the level of the individual animal between precontusion and postcontusion responses indicated significant increases in reactions to low threshold punctate mechanical stimuli, non-punctate stimuli and thermal stimuli (p < 0.05). To demonstrate the validity of this model as a central pain model, gabapentin, an agent used clinically for central pain, was given i.p. at 10 or 30 mg/kg. Gabapentin treatment significantly and reversibly changed the responses, consistent with the attenuation of the abnormal sensory behavior, and the attenuated responses lasted for the duration of the drug effect (up to 6 h). These results support the use of the spinal contusion model in the study of chronic central pain after SCI."

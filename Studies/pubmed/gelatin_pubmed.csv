As no useful treatment for post-SCI complications has been approved thus far, finding novel treatments is of great importance. Considering the promising effects of melatonin (MEL) against destructive mechanisms in other models of brain damage, in the current study we evaluated its ameliorative effects on sensory-motor outcomes, inflammatory mediators, histological changes and other post-SCI complications. Rats, in SCI and MEL groups, underwent laminectomy followed by a severe compression injury by an aneurysm clip. Then, intrathecal treatment with vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or MEL was carried out post-injury. Acetone drop, von Frey, inclined plane, and BBB tests as well as weight changes and auricle temperature, were used to evaluate the neuropathic pain, motor function, and other post-SCI complications. The effects of MEL on the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed using gelatin zymography method every week till day 28 post-SCI. Histopathological assessments were performed on days 14, 21, and 28. MEL treatment resulted in decreased motor dysfunction, mechanical and cold allodynia, auricle temperature, and also ameliorated weight loss. Moreover, MEL suppressed MMP-9 activity while increasing that of MMP-2 post-SCI indicating its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Also, MEL significantly preserved white matter myelinated areas and the number of sensory neurons post-SCI. The results suggest MEL as a promising candidate for medical therapies with advantageous effects on improving functional recovery through suppressing inflammatory mediators, and attenuating spinal tissue damages."

In this study, a dual-enzymatically cross-linked gelatin hydrogel with hydrogen horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and galactose oxidase (GalOx) was proposed to combine human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) for facilitating nerve regeneration post-SCI. In vitro, hUC-MSCs in this 3D gelatin hydrogel displayed good viability, proliferation, and neuronal differentiation. To further evaluate the neural regeneration effect of hUC-MSCs loaded into gelatin hydrogels in vivo, a clinically-relevant and force-controlled contusion model of mouse spinal cords was established. We found that implantation of a hydrogel loaded with hUC-MSCs significantly promoted the motor function recovery evaluated by Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) and footprint tests. Further histological analysis showed that the hydrogel and hUC-MSC combined transplantation dramatically decreased inflammation, inhibited apoptosis and promoted neurogenesis. Overall, implantation of this dual-enzymatically cross-linked and MSC-laden 3D gelatin hydrogel is a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI treatment."

Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate or differentiate into other specific cell types. These cells represent potential treatments for SCIs. However, recent studies have shown that NSCs mainly differentiate into astrocytes, rather than neurons, in the microenvironment of an SCI. BMSCs have been reported to promote neuronal differentiation of NSCs and reduce the formation of astrocytes. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) provides superior mechanical properties and functional characteristics for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In this study, we proposed a functional scaffold developed by loading BMSCs and NSCs into 3D GelMA hydrogel. BMSCs and NSCs that were photo-encapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and demonstrated good proliferation in vitro. The NSCs differentiated more toward neurons and oligodendrocytes than toward astrocytes, a phenomenon more noticeable in low-modulus hydrogels. When functional hydrogel scaffolds, loaded with BMSCs and NSCs, were implanted into the hemisection site of the rat spinal cord, they could significantly promote motor function recovery and neuronal differentiation, and decrease glial scarring, fibrotic scarring, and inflammatory responses. The immense therapeutic potential of this system to promote axonal regeneration was thereby demonstrated. Taken together, loading of the GelMA scaffold with BMSCs and NSCs is a promising therapeutic strategy to trigger functional regeneration of the spinal cord."

In this study, to attenuate activated microglia/macrophage mediated-inflammation in the spinal cord of complete transection SCI mice, a combination of photo-crosslinked hydrogel transplantation and CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397) treatment was used to replace the prolonged, activated microglia/macrophages via cell depletion and repopulation. This combined treatment in SCI mice produced a significant reduction in CD68-positive reactive microglia/macrophages and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and a substantial increase in the number of Tuj1-positive neurons in the lesion area compared with single treatment methods. Moreover, most of the newborn Tuj1-positive neurons were confirmed to be generated from endogenous NSPCs using a genetic fate mapping mouse line (Nestin-CreERT2; LSL-tdTomato) that can label and trace NSPC marker-nestin expressing cells and their progenies.

In the present study, human endometrial stem cells (hEnSCs) were cultured with human Schwann cells (hSC) in transwells, their differentiation into nerve-like cells was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry techniques. The differentiated cells (co-hEnSC) were then seeded on the poly ε-caprolactone (PCL)/gelatin scaffolds. The SEM images displayed the favorable seeding and survival of the cells on the scaffolds. The seeded scaffolds were then transplanted into hemisected SCI rats. The growth of neuronal cells was confirmed with immunohistochemical study using NF-H as a neuronal marker. Finally, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) test confirmed the recovery of sensory and motor functions. The results suggested that combination therapy using the differentiated hEnSC seeded on PCL/gelatin scaffolds has the potential to heal the injured spinal cord and to limit the secondary damage."

Transplantation of neural progenitors is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, infusion of dissociated cells often suffers from low viability, uneven cell distribution, and poor in vivo engraftment that could be reinforced by a better cell delivery system. Here, we develop an injectable composite hydrogel system for use as a minimally invasive treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) using motor neurons (MNs) derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The composite hydrogel is based on a modified gelatin matrix integrated with shape-memory polymer fibers. The gelatin matrix creates a local microenvironment for cell assembly and also acts as a lubricant during injection through a fine catheter. Notably, shape-memory fiber scaffolds are able to recover to maintain the microstructures even after dramatic deformation from injection operation, providing the necessary support and guidance for motor neuron differentiation. We find that the composite hydrogel with an aligned fiber scaffold greatly improves the viability of ESCs and their differentiation toward MNs both in vitro and in vivo. When transplanted to SCI animals by injection, the ESC-loaded composite hydrogels are identified to significantly enhance tissue regeneration and motor function recovery in mice. With this proof-of-concept study, we believe that the injectable composite hydrogel system provides a promising solution for in vivo cell delivery with minimum invasiveness and can be readily extended to other stem-cell-based regenerative treatments."

We have therefore extended in this study to construct a canine MSC-derived neural network tissue in vitro with the aim to evaluate its efficacy in treating adult beagle dog subjected to a complete transection of the spinal cord. The results showed that after co-culturing with neurotropin-3 overexpressing Schwann cells in a gelatin sponge scaffold for 14 days, TrkC overexpressing MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells. In the latter, some cells appeared to make contacts with each other through synapse-like structures with trans-synaptic electrical activities. Remarkably, the SCI canines receiving the transplantation of the MSC-derived neural network tissue demonstrated a gradual restoration of paralyzed limb motor function, along with improved electrophysiological presentation when compared with the control group. Magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging showed that the canines receiving the MSC-derived neural network tissue exhibited robust nerve tract regeneration in the injury/graft site. Histological analysis showed that some of the MSC-derived neuron-like cells had survived in the injury/graft site up to 6.5 months. Implantation of MSC-derived neural network tissue significantly improved the microenvironment of the injury/graft site. It is noteworthy that a variable number of them had integrated with the regenerating corticospinal tract nerve fibers and 5-HT nerve fibers through formation of synapse-like contacts.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) without supply constraints and ethical concerns have emerged as a viable treatment option for repairing neurological disorders. However, the primarily limitations in the neuroregeneration field are uncontrolled cell differentiation, and low cell viability caused by the ischemic environment. The mechanical property of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel can be easily controlled and shared similar characteristics with nerve tissue, thus promoting cell survival and controlled cell differentiation. We propose the combination of a 3D gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with iPSC-derived NSCs (iNSCs) to promote regeneration after SCI. In vitro, the iNSCs photoencapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and differentiated well, especially in lower-moduli hydrogels. More robust neurite outgrowth and more neuronal differentiation were detected in the soft hydrogel group. To further evaluate the in vivo neuronal regeneration effect of the GelMA hydrogels, a mouse spinal cord transection model was generated. We found that GelMA/iNSC implants significantly promoted functional recovery. Further histological analysis showed that the cavity areas were significantly reduced, and less collagen was deposited in the GelMA/iNSC group. Furthermore, the GelMA and iNSC combined transplantation decreased inflammation by reducing activated macrophages/microglia (CD68-positive cells). Additionally, GelMA/iNSC implantation showed striking therapeutic effects of inhibiting GFAP-positive cells and glial scar formation while simultaneously promoting axonal regeneration. Undoubtedly, use of this 3D hydrogel stem cell-loaded system is a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI repair."

In this study, we evaluated the neurorestorative effects of an engineered HGF with a collagen biding domain (CBD-HGF). CBD-HGF remained in the spinal cord for 7 days after a single administration, while unmodified HGF was barely seen at 1 day. When a gelatin-furfurylamine (FA) hydrogel was applied on damaged spinal cord as a scaffold, CBD-HGF was retained in gelatin-FA hydrogel for 7 days, whereas HGF had faded by 1 day. A single administration of CBD-HGF enhanced recovery from spinal cord compression injury compared with HGF, as determined by motor recovery, and electrophysiological and immunohistochemical analyses. CBD-HGF alone failed to improve recovery from a complete transection injury, however CBD-HGF combined with gelatin-FA hydrogel promoted endogenous repair and recovery more effectively than HGF with hydrogel.

Although a scaffold is sometimes used for retaining transplanted cells in damaged tissue, it is also known to induce redundant immunoreactions during the degradation processes. In this study, the authors prepared cell sheets made of BMSCs, which are transplantable without a scaffold, and investigated their effects on axonal regeneration, glial scar formation, and functional recovery in a completely transected SCI model in rats. METHODS BMSC sheets were prepared from the bone marrow of female Fischer 344 rats using ascorbic acid and were cryopreserved until the day of transplantation. A gelatin sponge (GS), as a control, or BMSC sheet was transplanted into a 2-mm-sized defect of the spinal cord at the T-8 level. Axonal regeneration and glial scar formation were assessed 2 and 8 weeks after transplantation by immunohistochemical analyses using anti-Tuj1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies, respectively. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. RESULTS The BMSC sheets promoted axonal regeneration at 2 weeks after transplantation, but there was no significant difference in the number of Tuj1-positive axons between the sheet- and GS-transplanted groups. At 8 weeks after transplantation, Tuj1-positive axons elongated across the sheet, and their numbers were significantly greater in the sheet group than in the GS group. The areas of GFAP-positive glial scars in the sheet group were significantly reduced compared with those of the GS group at both time points. Finally, hindlimb locomotor function was ameliorated in the sheet group at 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study indicate that an ascorbic acid-induced BMSC sheet is effective in the treatment of SCI and enables autologous transplantation without requiring a scaffold."

Previous work has demonstrated that recovery in the presence of spared axons after an incomplete lesion increases behavioral output after a subsequent complete spinal cord transection (TX). This suggests that spared axons direct adaptive changes in below-level neuronal networks of the lumbar cord. In response to spared fibers, we postulate that lumbar neuron networks support behavioral gains by preventing aberrant plasticity. As such, the present study measured histological and functional changes in the isolated lumbar cord after complete TX or incomplete contusion (SCI). To measure functional plasticity in the lumbar cord, we used an established instrumental learning paradigm (ILP). In this paradigm, neural circuits within isolated lumbar segments demonstrate learning by an increase in flexion duration that reduces exposure to a noxious leg shock. We employed this model using a proof-of-principle design to evaluate the role of sparing on lumbar learning and plasticity early (7 days) or late (42 days) after midthoracic SCI in a rodent model. Early after SCI or TX at 7 days, spinal learning was unattainable regardless of whether the animal recovered with or without axonal substrate. Failed learning occurred alongside measures of cell soma atrophy and aberrant dendritic spine expression within interneuron populations responsible for sensorimotor integration and learning. Alternatively, exposure of the lumbar cord to a small amount of spared axons for 6 weeks produced near-normal learning late after SCI. This coincided with greater cell soma volume and fewer aberrant dendritic spines on interneurons. Thus, an opportunity to influence activity-based learning in locomotor networks depends on spared axons limiting maladaptive plasticity. Together, this work identifies a time dependent interaction between spared axonal systems and adaptive plasticity in locomotor networks and highlights a critical window for activity-based rehabilitation."

Anisotropic alginate-based capillary hydrogels (ACH) support peripheral nervous system derived axon growth, which is accompanied by glial supporting cell migration into the ACH. The aim of the present study was to analyze central nervous system (CNS) derived (entorhinal cortex, spinal cord slice cultures) axon regrowth into ACH containing linearly aligned capillaries of defined capillary sizes without and with gelatin constituent. Anisotropic ACH were prepared by ionotropic gel formation using Ba(2+), Cu(2+), Sr(2+), or Zn(2+) ions resulting in gels with average capillary diameters of 11, 13, 29, and 89μm, respectively. Postnatal rat entorhinal cortex or spinal cord slice cultures were placed on top of 500μm thick ACH. Seven days later axon growth and astroglial migration into the ACH were determined. Axon density within capillaries correlated positively with increasing capillary diameters, whereas longitudinally oriented axon outgrowth diminished with increasing capillary diameter. Axons growing into the hydrogels were always accompanied by astrocytes strongly suggesting that respective cells are required to mediate CNS axon elongation into ACH. Overall, midsize capillary diameter ACH appeared to be the best compromise between axon density and orientation. Taken together, ACH promote CNS axon ingrowth, which is determined by the capillary diameter and migration of slice culture derived astroglia into the hydrogel. Biomaterials are investigated as therapeutic tools to bridge irreversible lesions following traumatic spinal cord injury. The goal is to develop biomaterials, which promote longitudinally oriented regeneration of as many injured axons as possible as prerequisite for substantial functional recovery. Optimal parameters of the biomaterial have yet to be defined. In the present study we show that increasing capillary diameters within such hydrogels enhanced central nervous system axon regeneration at the expense of longitudinal orientation. Axon ingrowth into the hydrogels was only observed in the presence of glial supporting cells, namely astrocytes. This suggests that alginate-based hydrogels need to be colonized with respective cells in order to facilitate axon ingrowth."

The effects of NGF-GNLs and NGF only were tested by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, inclined plane test, and footprint analysis. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining were further performed to identify the expression of ER stress-related proteins, neuron-specific marker neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43). Correlated downstream signals Akt/GSK-3β and ERK1/2 were also analyzed with or without inhibitors. Results showed that NGF-GNLs, compared to NGF only, enhanced the neuroprotection effect in SCI rats. The ER stress-induced apoptosis response proteins CHOP, GRP78 and caspase-12 inhibited by NGF-GNL treatment were more obvious. Meanwhile, NGF-GNLs in the recovery of SCI are related to the inhibition of ER stress-induced cell death via the activation of downstream signals PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and ERK1/2."

So far, there is still no effective treatment for spinal cord injury. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used to repair injured spinal cord as an effective strategy. However, the low neural differentiation frequency of MSCs has limited its application. The present study attempted to explore whether the grafted MSC-derived neural-like cells in a gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold could maintain neural features or transdifferentiate into myelin-forming cells in the transected spinal cord. We constructed an engineered tissue by co-seeding of MSCs with genetically enhanced expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) separately into a three-dimensional GS scaffold to promote the MSCs differentiating into neural-like cells and transplanted it into the gap of a completely transected rat spinal cord. The rats received extensive post-operation care, including cyclosporin A administrated once daily for 2 months. MSCs modified genetically could differentiate into neural-like cells in the MN + MT (NT-3-MSCs + TrKC-MSCs) group 14 days after culture in the GS scaffold. However, after the MSC-derived neural-like cells were transplanted into the injury site of spinal cord, some of them appeared to lose the neural phenotypes and instead transdifferentiated into myelin-forming cells at 8 weeks. In the latter, the MSC-derived myelin-forming cells established myelin sheaths associated with the host regenerating axons. And the injured host neurons were rescued, and axon regeneration was induced by grafted MSCs modified genetically. In addition, the cortical motor evoked potential and hindlimb locomotion were significantly ameliorated in the rat spinal cord transected in the MN + MT group compared with the GS and MSC groups. Grafted MSC-derived neural-like cells in the GS scaffold can transdifferentiate into myelin-forming cells in the completely transected rat spinal cord."

MSC-GS or GS was then grafted acutely into a 2 mm-wide transection gap in the T9-T10 spinal cord segments of adult rats. Eight weeks later, hindlimb function of the MSC-GS-treated SCT rats was significantly improved relative to controls receiving the GS or lesion only as indicated by BBB score. The MSC-GS transplantation also significantly recovered cortical motor evoked potential (CMEP). Histologically, MSC-derived neuron-like cells maintained their synapse-like structures in vivo; they additionally formed similar connections with host neurites (i.e., mostly serotonergic fibers plus a few corticospinal axons; validated by double-labeled immuno-EM). Moreover, motor cortex electrical stimulation triggered c-fos expression in the grafted and lumbar spinal cord cells of the treated rats only. Our data suggest that MSC-derived neuron-like cells resulting from NT-3-TrkC-induced differentiation can partially integrate into transected spinal cord and this strategy should be further investigated for reconstructing disrupted neural circuits."

Three-dimensional (3D) electrospun poly (lactide-co-glycolide)/polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanofiber scaffolds were used for iNSCs adhesion and growth.

Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Scale. Results indicated that iNSCs showed similar morphological features with wild-type neural stem cells (wt-NSCs), and expressed a variety of neural stem cell marker genes. Furthermore, iNSCs were shown to survive, with the ability to self-renew and undergo neural differentiation into neurons and glial cells within the 3D scaffolds in vivo. The iNSC-seeded scaffolds restored the continuity of the spinal cord and reduced cavity formation. Additionally, iNSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to functional recovery of the spinal cord. Therefore, PLGA-PEG scaffolds seeded with iNSCs may serve as promising supporting transplants for repairing spinal cord injury (SCI)."

A SCI model was established by surgery via a complete transection of the T10 vertebra of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Gelatin sponges were used to absorb NSCs labeled with the thymidine analog, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were transferred into the transected spinal cords. BYHWD was administered once a day by introgastric infusion. Motor functions of the hind limbs were evaluated using the 21-point locomotor rating scale developed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB). The fate of the transplanted NSCs under the various conditions was examined by double immunofluorescence staining, using markers for neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with BrdU. Ultrastructural changes of the SCI site following the various treatments were examined under a transmission electron microscope. The number of double positive cells for glial fibrillary acidic protein and BrdU in the BYHWD + NSC group was significantly decreased when compared with that in the NSC group (P<0.05). However, the number of cells that were labeled double positive for myelin basic protein and BrdU, as well as neuron specific enolase and BrdU, was greater in the BYHWD + NSC group when compared with the NSC group. Electron microscopy demonstrated that treatment with BYHWD combined with NSCs significantly alleviated demyelination. Results from the BBB motor function test exhibited a significant improvement in the BYHWD + NSC group when compared with the SCI, BYHWD and NSC only groups. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the traditional Chinese medicine formula, BYHWD, exerted an effect on the differentiation and migration of NSCs. Combining the administration of BYHWD with NSCs was shown to have a synergistic effect on the recovery of neurological function, mitigating the progress of demyelination or ameliorating the recovery of myelination."

Theoretically, it is expected that early blockade of activation of MMPs can provide neuro-protective effects from secondary tissue damage and improve functional neurological outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and to determine the regulatory effect of melatonin on MMP expression and activity after photochemically induced SCI in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300 g (age 8 weeks) received focal ischemia by photothrombosis using Rose Bengal (RB). The injured animals were divided into two groups; one group received 50 mg/kg of melatonin intraperitoneally, starting 1 h after injury and at 12 h intervals for 7 days, while animals in the control group received weight-adjusted doses of a saline vehicle. In each group, the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by Western blot and gelatin zymography at various times from 6 h to 3 days. The locomotor function was assessed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale at 3 days after SCI and then once per week for 4 weeks. The animals were killed at 28 days after the injury, and the histopathology of the lesions was assessed. The expressions and activities of MMP-9 were increased at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI in the control group. In the melatonin-treated group, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI compared with the control group, and the activity of MMP-9 was significantly reduced at 72 h after SCI. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the MMP-2 level in both groups during the experimental period. Melatonin treatment following photochemically induced SCI in rats significantly ameliorated the functional deficits. On histopathologic examination, the lesion size in the spinal cord after photothrombotic insult was significantly reduced by melatonin administration. This study showed that the up-regulation of MMP-9 correlated with the secondary damage after SCI in rats. The results of this study suggest that the ability of melatonin to reduce secondary tissue damage is intimately related to the reduction of MMP-9 expression, resulting in functional improvement."

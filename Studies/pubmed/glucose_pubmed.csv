The clinical data of 27 patients with symptomatic chronic thoracolumbar osteoporotic fractures combined with kyphosis treated between June 2015 and June 2017 were retrospectively analysed. Among them, there were 8 males and 19 females, with an average age of 69.5 years (range, 56-81 years). The damage segment (kyphosis vertex) included T 11 in 4 cases, T 12 in 12 cases, L 1 in 10 cases, and L 2 in 1 case. The disease duration ranged from 3 to 21 months, with an average of 12.5 months. The T value of lumbar vertebral bone mineral density ranged from -4.9 to -2.5, with an average value of -3.61. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification was used to evaluate spinal cord injury, there were 1 case of grade D and 26 cases of grade E. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Oswestry disability index (ODI), kyphosis Cobb angle of fracture site, and sagittal vertical axis (SVA) data were obtained before operation, at 2 weeks after operation, 3 months after operation, and last follow-up, to evaluate the quality of life and improvement of sagittal spine parameters. No complications related to pedicle screw and bone cement occurred. The incisions healed by first intention in 26 cases, and 1 incision healed after dressing change due to poor blood glucose control. There were no complications such as bedsore, hypostatic pneumonia, or deep venous thrombosis. All patients were followed up 8-24 months, with an average of 16.6 months. The VAS score, ODI score, Cobb angle, and SVA were significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in Cobb angle between each time point after operation ( P>0.05); the VAS score and ODI score at 3 months after operation and last follow-up were significantly better than those at 2 weeks after operation ( P<0.05), and the ODI score at last follow-up was further improved when compared with the score at 3 months ( P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in VAS score ( P>0.05); SVA at last follow-up was significantly worse than that at 2 weeks and 3 months after operation ( P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between at 2 weeks and 3 months after operation ( P>0.05). During the follow-up period, there was no complication such as pedicle screw loosening, breakage or cutting, adjacent vertebral fracture, proximal junctional kyphosis, and so on. For the chronic thoracolumbar osteoporotic fractures combined with kyphosis, the cement-injectable cannulated pedicle screw and multiple level Schwab grade Ⅰ osteotomy has the advantages of less operation trauma, quick recovery, and remarkable effectiveness."

Protection of both the function and integrity of endothelial cells as well as the prevention of BSCB disruption may be a strong strategy for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) cases. Sodium Tanshinone IIA silate (STS) is used for the treatment of coronary heart disease and improves microcirculation. Whether STS exhibits protective effects for SCI microcirculation is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects of STS on oxygen-glucose deprivation- (OGD-) induced injury of spinal cord endothelial cells (SCMECs) in vitro and to explore effects on BSCB and neurovascular protection in vivo. SCMECs were treated with various concentrations of STS (1 μM, 3 μM, and 10 μM) for 24 h with or without OGD-induction. Cell viability, tube formation, migration, and expression of Notch signaling pathway components were evaluated. Histopathological evaluation (H&E), Nissl staining, BSCB permeability, and the expression levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), CD31, NeuN, and Notch signaling pathway components were analyzed. STS was found to improve SCMEC functions and reduce inflammatory mediators after OGD. STS also relieved histopathological damage, increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), inhibited BSCB permeability, rescued microvessels, protected motor neuromas, and improved functional recovery in a SCI model. Moreover, we uncovered that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role during these processes. These results indicated that STS protects microcirculation in SCI, which may be used as a therapeutic strategy for SCI in the future."

One reason for this unfavorable outcome could be the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. MCC950 is a specific inhibitor of NLRP3 that further inhibits the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the NLRP3 inflammasome was associated with the severity of local apoptosis and whether MCC950 could prevent neuronal apoptosis following SCI. In this study, primary cortical neurons were cultured in vitro. With or without pretreatment/posttreatment with MCC950, neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h and then reperfusion for 20 h. Immunofluorescence was used to determine the expression of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved caspase-1 in neurons. In vivo, SCI model mice were established with a 5 g weight-drop method. MCC950 was intraperitoneally injected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 days after SCI. Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores and footprint assays were used to assess motor function. Paw withdrawal threshold and tail flick latency were used to assess somatosensory function. H&E, Nissl and TUNEL staining were used to measure histological changes and apoptosis at 3 days after SCI, and scar formation was observed by Masson staining and GFAP immunohistochemical analysis at 28 days after SCI. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that MCC950 inhibited OGD-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neurons. Behavioral tests, Masson staining and GFAP immunohistochemical analysis showed that MCC950-treated mice had improved neuronal functional recovery and reduced scar formation at 28 days after SCI. H&E, Nissl and TUNEL staining confirmed that there were more living neurons and fewer apoptotic neurons in MCC950-treated mice than control mice at 3 days after SCI. These results reveal that MCC950 exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuronal apoptosis, preserving the survival of the remaining neurons, attenuating the severity of the damage, and promoting the recovery of motor function after SCI."

Recently, moderate microtubule stabilization by Taxol has been shown to efficiently promote neurite regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the potential for the clinical translation of Taxol in treating SCI is limited by its side effects and low ability to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). Self-assembled peptide hydrogels have shown potential as drug carriers for the local delivery of therapeutic agents. We therefore hypothesized that the localized delivery of Taxol by a self-assembled peptide scaffold would promote axonal regeneration by stabilizing microtubules during the treatment of SCI. In the present study, the mechanistic functions of the Taxol-releasing system were clarified in vitro and in vivo using immunofluorescence labeling, histology and neurobehavioral analyses. Based on the findings from the in vitro study, Taxol released from a biological functionalized SAP nanofiber scaffold (FGLmx/Taxol) remained active and promoted neurite extension. In this study, we used a weight-drop contusion model to induce SCI at T9. The local delivery of Taxol from FGLmx/Taxol significantly decreased glial scarring and increased the number of nerve fibers compared with the use of FGLmx and 5% glucose. Furthermore, animals administered FGLmx/Taxol exhibited neurite preservation, smaller cavity dimensions, and decreased inflammation and demyelination. Thus, the local delivery of Taxol from FGLmx/Taxol was effective at promoting recovery after SCI and has potential as a new therapeutic strategy for SCI."

Recently, microRNA-421-3p-derived macrophages is found to promote motor function recovery in spinal cord injury. Here, we explored whether microRNA-421-3p is involved in inflammation responses during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and its molecular mechanism. An in vivo experimental animal model of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and in vitro model of microglial subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) were used. The effects of microRNA-421-3p on cerebral I/R injury and its underlying mechanism were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, RNA immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, luciferase reporter assay, and bioinformatics analysis. We find that microRNA-421-3p is significantly decreased in cerebral I/R injury in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA-421-3p evidently suppresses pro-inflammatory factor expressions and inhibits NF-κB p65 protein expression and nuclear translocation in BV2 microglia cells treated with OGD/R. However, microRNA-421-3p neither promotes p65 mRNA expression, nor affects p65 mRNA or protein stability. Moreover, we find the m6A 'reader' protein YTH domain family protein 1 (YTHDF1) is the specific target of microRNA-421-3p, and YTHDF1 specifically binds to the m6a site of p65 mRNA to promote its translation. microRNA-421-3p prevents inflammatory response in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through targeting YTHDF1 to inhibit p65 mRNA translation. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the molecular pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury."

Here, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into acute and chronic treatment groups and sham groups with day-matched periods. The Basso, Beatte, and Bresnahan scores method were utilized to evaluate the changes in behaviors during the recovery of the animals, and the metabolic information was measured with the 1 H-observed/13 C-edited NMR method. Total metabolic concentrations in every region were almost similar in both treated groups. However, the metabolic kinetics in most regions in the acute group were significantly altered (P < .05), particularly in the cortical area, thalamus and medulla (P < .01). After long-term recovery, some metabolic kinetics were recovered, especially in the temporal cortex, occipital cortex, and medulla. The metabolic kinetic changes revealed the alteration of metabolism and neurotransmission in different brain regions after SCI, which present evidence for the alternation of brain glucose oxidation. Therefore, this shows the significant influence of SCI on cerebral function and neuroscience research. This study also provides the theoretical basis for clinical therapy after SCI, such as mitochondrial transplantation."

Binding and immunoprecipitation assays indicated that NLK binds to GRP78. Pretreatment to cultured neurons with a GRP78-neutralizing antibody suppressed NLK-induced axonal growth. Blocking cell surface GRP78 inhibited neuronal NLK-induced Akt activation. Treatment with an Akt inhibitor suppressed NLK-induced axonal growth. Continuous administration of NLK into the lateral ventricle of SCI mice increased axonal density in the injured region and restored motor function, which was not observed when NLK was simultaneously administered with a GRP78-neutralizing antibody.

However, the effect of MCC950 treatment on neurological post-SCI recovery remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effect of MCC950 on an experimental SCI model in vivo and neuronal injury in vitro. We found that MCC950 improved the grip strength, hind limb movements, spinal cord edema, and pathological injury in the SCI mice. We demonstrated that it exerted this effect by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, including NLRP3-ASC and NLRP3-Caspase-1 complexes, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18. Moreover, we found that MCC950 reduced spinal neuron injury and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which had been induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vitro. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MCC950 alleviates inflammatory response and improves functional recovery in the acute mice model of SCI by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and alleviating downstream neuroinflammation.

Our results demonstrated that ER stress-induced apoptosis plays a significant role in injury of SCI model rats. FGF22 administration promoted recovery and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord lesions of model mice. The protective effect of FGF22 is related to decreased expression of CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78), caspase-12, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (Eif-2α) and Bad which are ER stress-induced apoptosis response proteins. Moreover, FGF22 administration also increased the number of neurons and the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) which was related to axon regeneration. We also demonstrated that the protective effect of FGF22 effectively reduces neuronal apoptosis and promotes axonal regeneration. Our study first illustrated that the function of FGF22 is related to the inhibition of ER stress-induced cell death in SCI recovery via activation of downstream signals.

In the human study, multivariate logistical regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, reflecting average plasma glucose concentration over a 3 month period, at admission were a significant risk factor for poor functional recovery. Moreover, patients with chronic hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) had high concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-8) of cerebrospinal fluid after SCI. Consistent with patient findings, chronic hyperglycemia before SCI in rats was associated with increased inflammatory responses and oxygen-free radicals in the spinal cord and blood, thus resulting in poor functional recovery and histological outcomes.

Metformin, a glucose-lowering agent, has been demonstrated to play roles in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the potential protective effect of metformin on nerve regeneration after SCI is still unclear. In this study, we found that the administration of metformin improved functional recovery after SCI through reducing neuronal cell apoptosis and repairing neurites by stabilizing microtubules via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002 partly reversed the therapeutic effects of metformin on SCI in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, metformin treatment weakened the excessive activation of oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 partially abolished its antioxidant effect. We also found that the Nrf2 transcription was partially reduced by LY294002 in vitro. Taken together, these results revealed that the role of metformin in nerve regeneration after SCI was probably related to stabilization of microtubules and inhibition of the excessive activation of Akt-mediated Nrf2/ARE pathway-regulated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our present study suggests that metformin administration may provide a potential therapy for SCI."

Methods: Primary rat BMSCs were co-cultured with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injured VSC4.1 motor neurons or primary cortical neurons. FACS analysis was used to detect the transfer of mitochondria from BMSCs to neurons. The bioenergetics profiling of neurons was detected by Extracellular Flux Analysis. Cell viability and apoptosis were also measured. BMSCs and isolated mitochondria were transplanted into SCI rats. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling staining was used to detect apoptotic neurons in the ventral horn. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to measure protein expression. Re-myelination was examined by transmission electron microscope. BBB scores were used to assess locomotor function. Results: MitoTracker-Red labelled mitochondria of BMSCs could be transferred to the OGD injured neurons. The gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) potentiator retinoid acid increased the quantity of mitochondria transfer from BMSCs to neurons, while GJIC inhibitor 18β glycyrrhetinic acid decreased mitochondria transfer. Internalization of mitochondria improved the bioenergetics profile, decreased apoptosis and promoted cell survival in post-OGD motor neurons. Furthermore, both transplantation of mitochondria and BMSCs to the injured spinal cord improved locomotor functional recovery in SCI rats. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that BMSCs protect against SCI through GJIC to transfer mitochondrial to the injured neurons. Our findings suggested a new therapy strategy of mitochondria transfer for the patients with SCI."

Here, we assessed the effect of CO releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3), the classical donor of CO, in SCI and explained its possible protective mechanism. Rat SCI model was performed with a vascular clip (30 g) compressing at T9 vertebral level for 1 min and CO was delivered immediately after SCI by CORM-3. The neurological deficits and neuron survival were assessed. Inflammasome and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway were measured by western blot and immunofluorescence. For in vitro study, oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) simulated the SCI-inflammasome change in cultured the primary neurons. CORM-3 suppressed inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis occurrence, which consequently alleviated neuron death and improved motor functional recovery following SCI. As a pivotal sensor involving in endoplasmic reticulum stress-medicated inflammasome signaling, IRE1 and its downstream X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) were activated in SCI tissues as well as in OGD neurons; while inhibition of IRE1 by STF-083010 in SCI rats or by si-RNA in OGD neurons suppressed inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis. Interestingly, the SCI/OGD-stimulated IRE1 activation was attenuated by CORM-3 treatment. CO may alleviate neuron death and improve motor functional recovery in SCI through IRE1 regulation, and administration of CO could be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI."

The present study investigates whether systemic administration of conditioned medium from MSCs (MSCcm) has the potential to be efficacious as an alternative to cell-based therapy for SCI. In neuron-glial cultures, MSC coculture effectively promoted neuronal connection and reduced oxygen glucose deprivation-induced cell damage. The protection was elicited even if neuron-glial culture was used to expose MSCcm, suggesting the effects possibly from released fractions of MSC. In vivo, intravenous administration of MSCcm to SCI rats significantly improved behavioral recovery from spinal cord injury, and there were increased densities of axons in the lesion site of MSCcm-treated rats compared to SCI rats. At early days postinjury, MSCcm treatment upregulated the protein levels of Olig 2 and HSP70 and also increased autophage-related proteins in the injured spinal cords. Together, these findings suggest that MSCcm treatment promotes spinal cord repair and functional recovery, possibly via activation of autophagy and enhancement of survival-related proteins."

First, SCI disrupted diurnal rhythms in two metabolic behaviors: fecal production and food intake rhythms were ablated acutely. SCI also expedited whole-gut transit time. In parallel, acute SCI increased plasma glucose. Diurnal glucose storage-release cycles regulated by the liver were disrupted by SCI, which also increased liver glucose metabolism messenger RNAs (mRNAs).

The in vitro results in PC-12 cells revealed that the augmentation of endogenous miR-21 was able to reduce neuronal cell death after OGD. In addition, overexpression of miR-21 was able to reduce cellular apoptosis via decreasing PDCD4 protein levels, and caspase-3 activity was also influenced. Transfection of miR-21 into 293T cells was able to decrease luciferase activity in a reporter assay system, including the 3' untranslated region of PDCD4. miR-21 may have a protective role in neuronal apoptosis after SCI.

A primary function of CNS astrocytes is to support the survival and function of neurons. In response to injury, astrocytes take on a reactive phenotype, which alters their molecular functions. Reactive astrocytes have been reported to be both beneficial and harmful to the CNS recovery process subsequent to injury. Understanding the molecular processes and regulatory proteins that determine the extent to which an astrocyte hinders or supports neuronal survival is important within the context of CNS repair. One protein that plays a role in modulating cellular survival is transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Global deletion of TG2 results in beneficial outcomes subsequent to in vivo ischemic brain injury. Ex vivo studies have also implicated TG2 as a negative regulator of astrocyte viability subsequent to injury. In this study we show that knocking down TG2 in astrocytes significantly increases their ability to protect neurons from oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion injury. To begin to understand how deletion of TG2 in astrocytes improves their ability to protect neurons from injury, we performed transcriptome analysis of wild type and TG2-/- astrocytes. TG2 deletion resulted in alterations in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion and axon growth/guidance. In addition, the majority of genes that showed increases in the TG2-/- astrocytes had predicted cJun/AP-1 binding motifs in their promoters. Furthermore, phospho-cJun levels were robustly elevated in TG2-/- astrocytes, a finding which was consistent with the increase in expression of AP-1 responsive genes. These in vitro data were subsequently extended into an in vivo model to determine whether the absence of astrocytic TG2 improves outcomes after CNS injury. Our results show that, following a spinal cord injury, scar formation is significantly attenuated in mice with astrocyte-specific TG2 deletion compared to mice expressing normal TG2 levels. Taken together, these data indicate that TG2 plays a pivotal role in mediating reactive astrocyte properties following CNS injury. Further, the data suggest that limiting the AP-1 mediated pro-survival injury response may be a contributing factor to that the detrimental effects of astrocytic TG2."

AKR1B1, one member of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, is involved in the energy metabolism of plasm glucose and ROS production. The role of AKR1B1 in cancer cell proliferation and invasion has been confirmed. Meanwhile, Akt, one pivotal transcription factor particularly, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and ROS-mediated secondary injury in the lesion site. In our study, we established an acute SCI rat model to identify the expression of AKR1B1 and its role in neural recovery processes. Western blotting revealed the expression of AKR1B1 protein was elevated after injury, peaked at 3 days and declined gradually to normal at 14 days. Similar results was illustrated in immunohistochemistry staining of white matter. Double immunofluorescence staining showed AKR1B1 was expressed in glial cells and its expression was significantly increased in proliferative astrocytes during the pathological processes. Further experiments showed AKR1B1 was co-located with Akt protein in GFAP positive cells and immunoprecipitated with Akt in injured spinal cord as well. In summary, the present study demonstrated AKR1B1 played a vital role in astrocytes proliferation through Akt pathway, associated with the metabolism of hyperglycemia induced by SCI."

After treatment with JNK and p38 inhibitors, abnormally necroptotic cell death caused by GIT1 knockdown could be partially rescued, with the recovery of neuronal viability, which was still poorer than that in control neurons. Meanwhile, overactivation of JNK/p38 after GIT1 depletion was concomitant with excessive activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) that could be abolished by ASK1 silencing in HEK293T cells.

There are many important differences between spinal cord injury in experimental animals and in human clinical cases, making it difficult to introduce new therapies into clinical practice. Spinal cord injury is also common in pet dogs and requires new effective therapies, meaning that they can act as a translational model for the human condition while also deriving direct benefits from such research. In this study we investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of glyburide in dogs with clinical spinal cord injury. We recruited dogs that had incurred an acute thoracolumbar spinal cord injury within the previous 72 h. These had become acutely non-ambulatory on the pelvic limbs and were admitted to our veterinary hospitals to undergo anesthesia, cross sectional diagnostic imaging, and surgical decompression. Oral glyburide was given to each dog at a dose of 75 mcg/kg. In five dogs, we measured blood glucose concentrations for 10 h after a single oral dose. In six dogs, we measured serum glyburide and glucose concentrations for 24 h and estimated pharmacokinetic parameters to estimate a suitable dose for use in a subsequent clinical trial in similarly affected dogs. No detrimental effects of glyburide administration were detected in any participating dog. Peak serum concentrations of glyburide were attained at a mean of 13 h after dosing, and mean apparent elimination half-life was approximately 7 h. Observed mean maximum plasma concentration was 31 ng/mL. At the glyburide dose administered there was no observable association between glyburide and glucose concentrations in blood. Our data suggest that glyburide can be safely administered to dogs that are undergoing anesthesia, imaging and surgery for treatment of their acute spinal cord injury and can attain clinically-relevant serum concentrations without developing hazardous hypoglycemia. Serum glyburide concentrations achieved in this study suggest that a loading dose of 150 mcg/kg followed by repeat doses of 75 mcg/kg at 8-hourly intervals would lead to serum glyburide concentrations of 25-50 ng/mL within an acceptably short enough period after oral administration to be appropriate for a clinical trial in canine spinal cord injury."

We then studied the effects of HMGB1 inhibition on cellular swelling, HMGB1 and AQP4 expression, and HMGB1 release. The roles of both toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in reducing cellular swelling resulting from HMGB1 inhibition in spinal cord astrocytes after OGD/R were studied. Intergroup data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test. The OGD/R increased spinal cord astrocytic swelling and HMGB1 and AQP4 expression, as well as HMGB1 release. Inhibition of HMGB1 using either HMGB1 shRNA or ethyl pyruvate resulted in reduced cellular volume, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum swelling, and lysosome number and decreased upregulation of both HMGB1 and AQP4 in spinal cord astrocytes, as well as HMGB1 release. The HMGB1 effects on spinal cord astrocytic swelling and AQP4 upregulation after OGD/R were mediated-at least in part-via activation of TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and NF-κB. These activation effects can be repressed by TLR4 inhibition using CLI-095 or C34, or by NF-κB inhibition using BAY 11-7082. Furthermore, either OGD/R or HMGB1 inhibition resulted in changes in IL-6 release. IL-6 was also shown to mediate AQP4 expression in spinal cord astrocytes.

Longitudinal study. Community-based supervised intervention. Participants (N=17) comprised individuals with SCI (n=9) who volunteered for this study, and able-bodied individuals (n=8) matched for age, height, and body mass index who were assessed at baseline only. The arm-cranking exercise program was performed for 10 weeks with 4 sessions per week. Sessions consisted of 2 sets of warmup (5min) and arm crank exercises (25min) with a 10-minute recovery at an intensity of 50% to 70% of heart rate reserve. Body mass (BM), waist circumference (WC), aerobic capacity (peak oxygen consumption [Vo2peak]), PAI-1, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and lipids. PAI-1, BM, WC, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides (TG) decreased, and Vo2peak increased after training (P<.05, respectively). Spearman rank-order analysis revealed that changes in PAI-1 were related to changes in Vo2peak, BM, WC, TG, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that WC was the most sensitive factor for predicting changes in PAI-1 (P=.038). These results suggest that 10 weeks of arm-cranking exercise training for people with SCI may help to reduce the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In addition, changes in abdominal fat may be related to changes in PAI-1 in the SCI population."

The present study is performed to explore the mechanism of BSCB permeability changes which are induced by EGF treatment after SCI in rats. In this study, we demonstrate that EGF administration inhibits the disruption of BSCB permeability and improves the locomotor activity in SCI model rats. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathways by a specific inhibitor, LY294002, suppresses EGF-induced Rac1 activation as well as tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) expression. Furthermore, the protective effect of EGF on BSCB is related to the activation of Rac1 both in vivo and in vitro. Blockade of Rac1 activation with Rac1 siRNA downregulates EGF-induced TJ and AJ proteins expression in endothelial cells. Taken together, our results indicate that EGF treatment preserves BSCB integrity and improves functional recovery after SCI via PI3K-Akt-Rac1 signalling pathway."

This study tested the hypothesis that HBO treatment protects against secondary SCI by inhibiting the ERS response via regulation of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) expression. Rats were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, and SCI + HBO groups and the extent of neuronal damage and neurological recovery were evaluated 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. GRP78 and JNK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical, western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses, while caspase-3 activation was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SCI resulted in an upregulation in GRP78 and JNK expression compared to sham-operated animals. HBO treatment increased GRP78 level, but decreased that of JNK and suppressed caspase-3 activation as well as neuronal damage relative to the SCI group. In addition, hind limb motor function was improved by HBO treatment. HBO treatment reduces SCI-induced neuronal death and promotes the recovery of neurological function recovery by inhibiting the ERS response via modulation of GRP78 and JNK expression levels."

C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, SCI group, and melatonin group (n = 27 per group). Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso Mouse Scale. Motor neurons were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Pericyte coverage was analyzed using immunofluorescence. Permeability of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) was assessed by administration of Evan's Blue. Protein levels of occludin, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Bcl-2, and Bax were determined using Western blotting. Mimicking the pathological conditions of SCI, melatonin-treated primary pericytes were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Secretion of Ang1 was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of ICAM-1 was detected by immunofluorescence. Melatonin treatment improved locomotor functional outcome and rescued motor neurons. Pericyte coverage was significantly reduced after SCI; melatonin treatment alleviated the loss of pericyte coverage and rescued perfused microvessels 7 days after injury. The permeability of BSCB and loss of occludin were attenuated, and edema formation and upregulation of AQP4 were inhibited, after melatonin treatment. The expression of Ang1 and Bcl-2 was improved, while the expression of ICAM-1 and Bax was inhibited, in melatonin-treated SCI mice. Furthermore, the secretion of Ang1 was increased and the expression of ICAM-1 was inhibited in melatonin-treated pericytes after OGD/R. Melatonin ameliorated the loss of blood vessels and disruption of BSCB to exert a protective effect on SCI, which might be mediated by increased pericyte coverage.

Starting 4 hours following C5 hemi-contusion injury animals were fed either a standard carbohydrate based diet or a KD formulation with lipid to carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 3:1. The forelimb functional recovery was evaluated for 14 weeks, followed by quantitative histopathology. Post-injury 3:1 KD treatment resulted in increased usage and range of motion of the affected forepaw. Furthermore, KD improved pellet retrieval with recovery of wrist and digit movements. Importantly, after returning to a standard diet after 12 weeks of KD treatment, the improved forelimb function remained stable. Histologically, the spinal cords of KD treated animals displayed smaller lesion areas and more grey matter sparing. In addition, KD treatment increased the number of glucose transporter-1 positive blood vessels in the lesion penumbra and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) expression. Pharmacological inhibition of MCTs with 4-CIN (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate) prevented the KD-induced neuroprotection after SCI, In conclusion, post-injury KD effectively promotes functional recovery and is neuroprotective after cervical SCI. These beneficial effects require the function of monocarboxylate transporters responsible for ketone uptake and link the observed neuroprotection directly to the function of ketones, which are known to exert neuroprotection by multiple mechanisms. Our data suggest that current clinical nutritional guidelines, which include relatively high carbohydrate contents, should be revisited."

Sixteen RCTs, involving 1248 neurocritical care patients, were included. Glycemic targets with intensive insulin ranged from 70-140 mg/dl (3.9-7.8 mmol/L), while conventional protocols aimed to keep glucose levels below 144-300 mg/dl (8.0-16.7 mmol/L). Tight glycemic control had no impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.83-1.17; p = 0.88), but did result in fewer unfavorable neurological outcomes (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-1.00; p = 0.04). However, improved outcomes were only observed when glucose levels in the conventional glycemic control group were permitted to be relatively high [threshold for insulin administration > 200 mg/dl (> 11.1 mmol/L)], but not with more intermediate glycemic targets [threshold for insulin administration 140-180 mg/dl (7.8-10.0 mmol/L)].

Intensive insulin therapy significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia and does not influence mortality among neurocritical care patients. Very loose glucose control is associated with worse neurological recovery and should be avoided. These results suggest that intermediate glycemic goals may be most appropriate."

Induction of self-renewal and proliferation of endogenous regenerative machinery with noninvasive and nontoxic therapies could constitute a real hope and an alternative to cell transplantation for spinal cord injury patients. We previously showed that FM19G11 promotes differentiation of adult spinal cord-derived ependymal stem cells under hypoxia. Interestingly, FM19G11 induces self-renewal of these ependymal stem cells grown under normoxia. The analysis of the mechanism of action revealed an early increment of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 and 2 with an early drop of ATP, followed by a subsequent compensatory recovery with activated mitochondrial metabolism and the induction of glucose uptake by upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-4. Here we show that phosphorylation of AKT and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is involved in FM19G11-dependent activation of GLUT-4, glucose influx, and consequently in stem cell self-renewal. Small interfering RNA of uncoupling protein 1/2, GLUT-4 and pharmacological inhibitors of AKT, mTOR and AMPK signaling blocked the FM19G11-dependent induction of the self-renewal-related markers Sox2, Oct4, and Notch1. Importantly, FM19G11-treated animals showed accelerated locomotor recovery. In vivo intrathecal sustained administration of FM19G11 in rats after spinal cord injury showed more neurofilament TUJ1-positive fibers crossing the injured area surrounded by an increase of neural precursor Vimentin-positive cells. Overall, FM19G11 exerts an important influence on the self-renewal of ependymal stem progenitor cells with a plausible neuroprotective role, providing functional benefits for spinal cord injury treatment."

Recent evidence indicates that fluoxetine, an anti-depressant drug, is shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischaemic brain injury, but the precise mechanism underlying its protective effects is largely unknown. Here, we show that fluoxetine prevented blood-spinal cord barrier disruption via inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activation after spinal cord injury. After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with an infinite horizon impactor in the mouse, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and further administered once a day for indicated time points. Fluoxetine treatment significantly inhibited messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, 9 and 12 after spinal cord injury. By zymography and fluorimetric enzyme activity assay, fluoxetine also significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease 2 and matrix metalloprotease 9 activities after injury. In addition, fluoxetine inhibited nuclear factor kappa B-dependent matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in bEnd.3, a brain endothelial cell line, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Fluoxetine also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as zona occludens 1 and occludin after injury in vivo as well as in bEnd.3 cultures. By immunofluorescence staining, fluoxetine prevented the breakdown of the tight junction integrity in endothelial cells of blood vessel after injury. Furthermore, fluoxetine inhibited the messenger RNA expression of chemokines such as Groα, MIP1α and 1β, and prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators after injury. Finally, fluoxetine attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved locomotor function after injury. Thus, our results indicate that fluoxetine improved functional recovery in part by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease activation and preventing blood-spinal cord barrier disruption after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our study suggests that fluoxetine may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity following ischaemic brain injury and spinal cord injury in humans."

However, delivery of the therapeutic proteins into the brain parenchyma is limited due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We first generated a biologically active NEP1-40 fusion protein containing the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the transactivator of transcription (TAT), TAT-NEP1-40, which crosses the BBB in vivo after systemic delivery. The TAT-NEP1-40 can protect PC12 cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and promote neurite outgrowth when added exogenously to culture medium.

A series of 858 thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs (June 1990-June 2006) with an overall paraplegia rate of 2.7% was analyzed retrospectively. Serial segmental artery sacrifice was monitored by using somatosensory evoked potentials; segmental arteries were not reimplanted. Of a total of 20 cases of paraplegia, 3 occurred intraoperatively and 7 occurred late postoperatively: these will not be analyzed further. In 10 cases (the paraplegia group) spinal cord injury occurred within 48 hours after thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, despite intact somatosensory evoked potentials at the end of the procedure. These patients with early postoperative delayed paraplegia were compared with 10 matched control subjects who recovered without spinal cord injury. In the paraplegia group a median of 9 segmental arteries (range, 5-12 segmental arteries) were sacrificed. There were 9 male subjects: median age was 63 years (range, 40-79 years), and 4 of 10 had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A median of 9 segmental arteries (range, 2-12 segmental arteries) were also sacrificed in the matched recovery group. There were 4 male subjects; median age was 66 years (range, 40-78 years), and 8 of 10 had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. During the first 48 hours postoperatively, there were no significant differences in arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturation, partial arterial O2 and CO2 pressures, body temperature, glucose, hematocrit, or pH. The mean central venous pressures, however, were significantly higher in the paraplegic patients from 1 to 5 hours postoperatively (P = .03). In addition, although absolute mean aortic pressures did not differ between matched pairs postoperatively, when pressures were considered as a percentage of individual antecedent preoperative mean aortic pressure, paraplegic patients had significantly lower values during the first 5 hours postoperatively (P = .03). This study suggests that paraplegia can result from inadequate postoperative spinal cord perfusion caused by relatively minor differences from control subjects in perfusion parameters. Delayed paraplegia can perhaps be prevented with better hemodynamic and fluid management."

This study was undertaken to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of insulin in the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI) and evaluate its therapeutic effects in adult rats. SCI was produced by extradural compression using modified Allen's stall with damage energy of 40 g-cm force. One group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of recombinant human insulin dissolved in 50% glucose solution at the dose of 1 IU/kg day, for 7 days. At the same time, another group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of an equal volume of sterile saline solution. Functional recovery was evaluated using open-field walking, inclined plane tests, and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during the first 14 days post-trauma. Levels of protein for B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (Bcl-2), Caspase-3, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were quantified in the injured spinal cord by Western blot analysis. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Ultimately, the data established the effectiveness of insulin treatment in improving neurologic recovery, increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 proteins, inhibiting caspase-3 expression decreasing neuronal apoptosis, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines iNOS and COX-2, and ameliorating microcirculation of injured spinal cord after moderate contusive SCI in rats. In sum, this study reported the beneficial effects of insulin in the treatment of SCI, with the suggestion that insulin should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent."

All three of these proteins bind to a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) to inhibit axonal outgrowth in vitro. To explore the necessity of NgR for responses to myelin inhibitors and for restriction of axonal growth in the adult CNS, we generated ngr(-/-) mice. Mice lacking NgR are viable but display hypoactivity and motor impairment. DRG neurons lacking NgR do not bind Nogo-66, and their growth cones are not collapsed by Nogo-66. Recovery of motor function after dorsal hemisection or complete transection of the spinal cord is improved in the ngr(-/-) mice. While corticospinal fibers do not regenerate in mice lacking NgR, regeneration of some raphespinal and rubrospinal fibers does occur. Thus, NgR is partially responsible for limiting the regeneration of certain fiber systems in the adult CNS."

Rats received a moderate contusion injury and 15 min later were treated with one of two doses of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzol[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium (NBQX), MK-801, or the appropriate vehicle. At 4 h following injury, spinal cords were removed and a crude synaptosomal preparation obtained to examine mitochondrial function using the MTT assay, as well as measures of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and glutamate and glucose uptake. We report here that intraspinal treatment with either 15 or 30 nmol of NBQX improves mitochondrial function and reduces the levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation products. In contrast, MK-801, given intravenously at doses of 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg, was without effect on these same measures. Neither drug treatment had an effect on glutamate or glucose uptake, both of which are reduced at acute times following SCI. Previous studies have documented that drugs acting on non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors exhibit greater efficacy compared to NMDA receptor antagonists on recovery of function and tissue sparing following traumatic spinal cord injury. The results of this study provide a potential mechanism by which blockade of the non-NMDA ionotropic receptors exhibit positive effects following traumatic SCI."

Experimental diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 250-280 g) with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg i.p.). Eight weeks after the treatment with streptozotocin the animals were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate and laminectomy was performed at T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) loaded with a weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed spinal cord for 5 min. Postoperative neurological function was assessed using inclined plane test, modified Tarlov score, and vocal and sensory score daily for 10 days. Electrophysiological changes were assessed using somatosensory and corticomotor evoked-potentials. The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals and injured site of the spinal cord was analyzed for changes in vitamin E and glutathione levels (as markers of oxidative stress). Pathological changes in spinal cord were also studied using light microscopy. The data on neurobehavioral study clearly indicated that the compression of spinal cord produced highly significant neurological deficit and poor recovery in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats. Our histopathological and electrophysiological results also confirmed that diabetic animals are more susceptible to compressive spinal cord injury as compared to nondiabetic animals. A higher depletion of antioxidant defense markers (vitamin E and glutathione) was observed in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats. These results point toward the role of free radicals in poor recovery in diabetic rats following neurotrauma. Further studies are warranted to assess the neuroprotective potential of antioxidants to retard the secondary pathophysiological events following neurotrauma and to enhance the recovery."

This review will briefly describe the technique currently used to investigate brain function with PET and will summarize results on motor activation in healthy subjects. It will further illustrate how resting brain energy metabolism changes following transverse spinal cord injury. In addition, data from activation studies in stroke patients will be presented which indicate that recovery of motor function is associated with the recruitment of cortical regions of the non-damaged hemisphere and with the extension of activated brain areas adjacent to brain lesions themselves."

Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and injured by placing a 190-gm weight on the spinal cord for 5 minutes. Biochemical analysis of the injured segment revealed a significant depletion in the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (P-creatine), and total adenylates for the entire 24-hour recovery period. Glucose levels initially declined, but by 1 hour had normalized, and at 8 and 24 hours were significantly supranormal. The lactate/pyruvate ratio and tissue lactate concentrations increased four and five and half times, respectively, for the first 4 hours after injury. Between 8 and 24 hours, lactate levels remained elevated, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio declined to contol levels as the result of a significant rise in the tissue pyruvate concentration. This sequence of metabolic changes suggested that metabolism was probably not homogeneous throughout the injured segment, and that tissue metabolic rate was depressed for the initial 4 hours after trauma then increased in metabolically active tissue for the remainder of the 24-hour recovery period. This model of spinal cord trauma results in a severe, prolonged ischemia and metabolic injury to the affected tissue. Whether these metabolic changes results from or cause the tissue damage and irreversible paraplegia associated with this type of spinal cord injury remains to be determined."

In the present work, we screened the miRs involved and the associated pathway. In a rat model of SCI, the microarray analysis for expression of miRs at various time points post-SCI was done. The locomotor analysis was done by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score, and Cresyl violet staining was done for lesion volume and TUNEL assay was done for apoptosis in neuronal cells. The expression of apoptotic proteins was done by the western blot study. It was evidenced that the expression of the number of miRs was altered on the 14th day post-SCI, and miR-142-3p was found to be the most significantly suppressed miR. The results suggested that overexpression of miR-142-3p by its agomir-attenuated functional recovery decreased lesion size and apoptosis of neuronal cells in rats subjected to SCI. The luciferase assay indicated that miR-142-3p blocked the levels of Bax, which is a significant activator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (MAP) via targeting the 3'UTR region of BV-2 cells, and in addition, pc-DNA-Bax restored Bax and inhibited the correcting role of miR-142-3p in hydrogen peroxide-treated BV-2 cells. The findings suggested that miR-142-3p may inhibit the MAP by inhibiting the expression of cleaved-caspase-3/-9 and Bax in SCI rats. This study concludes that miR-142-3p may attenuate the functional recovery and decrease apoptosis in neuronal cells via inhibiting the MAP in the spinal cord-injured rats, confirming miR-142-3p as a potential therapeutic target in treating SCI."

Among the studies centered on the factors inducing SCIs, inflammatory response has a dramatic input on the pathogenesis of SCIs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Tricholoma matsutake polysaccharides (TMP) on function recovery following SCIs. The cell viability, neurite growth, NF-kappa B, TNFα and IL-6 production from hydrogen peroxide-treated PC12 cells were analyzed. In-vivo, a total of 36 male C57 mice were divided into sham group, SCI group and TMP group (100 mg/kg). The protective effects of TMP were evaluated by Basso mouse scale (BMS) scores, HE staining, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. TMP promoted neurite growth and inhibited TNFα, IL-6 and NF-kappa B signaling in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, compared with the SCI group, the BMS scores and nerve regeneration showed a significant increase, while NF-kappa B signaling, TNFα and IL-6 production significantly decreased after TMP treatment. TMP has a protective effect against SCIs in vitro and in vivo, which may be a potential strategy for future application in clinical practice."

Neuroprotection conferred by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors against various insults and deficits in the central nervous system has been reported previously. Herein, we set out to ascertain whether HDAC3 inhibition exerts neuroprotective effects against SCI. A modified Allen's weight-drop method was performed to induce experimental SCI in rats. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores were used to assess locomotor function. Flow cytometric analysis of AnnexinV-FITC/PI double staining, TUNEL staining, and immunoblotting analysis of apoptosis-related proteins were performed to determine apoptosis in H2O2-induced cell injury of primary rat neurons. Upregulated HDAC3 and downregulated miR-27a were observed in spinal cord tissues of SCI rats and H2O2-injured neurons. HDAC3 knockdown by its specific shRNA restored the locomotor function of SCI rats and prevented rat neurons from H2O2-induced apoptosis through promotion of miR-27a. miR-27a targeted PAK6 (encoding P21-activated kinase 6) and inhibited its expression. The effects of HDAC3 knockdown on the locomotor function of SCI rats and H2O2-induced apoptosis of rat neurons were lost upon further PAK6 overexpression. The present study uncovers that silencing HDAC3 inhibited PAK6 expression by upregulating miR-27a, eventually inhibiting neuron apoptosis and promoting the recovery of SCI, which might provide a novel therapeutic target for SCI."

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect and mechanism of action of MGMT in strengthing neuronal apoptosis following SCI. To determine MGMT-mediated apoptosis in spinal cord injury, we performed western blot and analyzed the expression change of MGMT with different timepoints. Western blot analysis showed the upregulation of MGMT has a peak at 21 days in injured spinal cord tissues. Expression and location was observed in the neurons after SCI. Upregulation of p53, Bax, cleaved caspase3 and cleaved caspase9 and downregulation of Bcl2 were detected after SCI. Co-localization of cleaved caspase3 with MGMT indicated MGMT involved in apoptosis taking place after SCI. In addition, we carried out H2O2 stimulation to further confirm MGMT played a role in neuron apoptosis process and activated p53 signaling pathway in vitro. Finally, based above data, we packaged lenti-associated virus inhibit MGMT expression and injected into rat spinal cords after SCI model was built. LV-MGMT not only reduces the neuron apoptosis, but also increases GAP43 expression and promotes hindlimbs locomotor function recovery. Taken together, the in vivo data and the in vitro observations prove MGMT-mediated apoptosis in the injured spinal cord."

The current available clinical therapies are unable to provide effective recovery of nerve functions. Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds is a promising approach to bridge the damaged nerve tissue in the absence of the extracellular matrix. However, the treatments have been impaired by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species in the microenvironment of acute spinal cord injury. Efficient delivery of antioxidants and biocompatible materials and reagents has been a challenge. Herein, a novel hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel functionalized with the antioxidant compound 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is fabricated for nerve tissue regeneration after serious spinal cord transection in rats. TEMPO is tethered onto HA chains to form HA-TEMPO through a Schiff base reaction between 4-amino-TEMPO and aldehyde modified HA chains. The TEMPO-hydrogel is constructed with a highly porous three-dimensional structure via the gelation between the residue aldehydes in HA-TEMPO and the amines in adipic dihydrazide modified HA. The functional TEMPO-hydrogel exhibits the antioxidant effect in an H2O2 simulated in vitro peroxidative microenvironment. Implantation of the functional hydrogel in vivo induces a significant motor function restoration, which could be attributed to the effective functions of the TEMPO-hydrogel in tissue reconnection as well as nerve fiber regeneration of the central nervous spinal cord tissue. Importantly, the treatment with the TEMPO-hydrogel effectively protects the bladder tissue from neurogenic damage. Therefore, the functional TEMPO-hydrogel provides a promising strategy for the treatment of central nervous system diseases through the antioxidant and lesion-bridging regulation of the pathological microenvironment."

Cell therapy constitutes a promising therapeutic approach for SCI; however, its clinical potential is seriously limited by their low survival in the hostile conditions encompassing the acute phase of SCI. Human HC016 (hHC016) cells, generated from expanded human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and pulsed with a patented protocol with hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), are expected to acquire improved resistance to oxidative environments which appears as a major limiting factor hampering the engrafting success. Our specific aim was to assess whether H2 O2 -pulsed hHC016 cells had an improved survival and thus therapeutic efficacy in a rat contusion model of acute SCI when grafted 48 hr after injury. Functional recovery was evaluated up to 56 days post-injury (dpi) by locomotor (open field test and CatWalk) and sensory (Von Frey and Hargreaves) tests. Besides, histological evaluation of transplanted cell survival and tissue protection/regeneration was also performed. Functional results showed a statistically significant improvement on locomotor recovery outcomes with hHC016 cells. Accordingly, superior cell survival in correlation with long-term neuroprotection, higher axonal regeneration, and reduced astroglial and microglial reactivity was also observed with hHC016 cells. These results demonstrate an enhanced survival capacity of hHC016 cells resulting in improved functional and histological outcomes as compared with hAMSCs, indicating that hHC016 cell transplants may constitute a promising cell therapy for acute SCI."

Here, we analyzed whether histone H1 affects functional recovery, axon regrowth/sprouting, and target reinnervation after spinal cord injury of adult mice. Furthermore, we tested in vitro histone H1's effect on astrocytic gene expression, cell shape and migration as well as on cell survival of cultured motoneurons. We applied histone H1 to compressed spinal cord and determined functional recovery and number of fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)- and neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)- positive glial cells, which contribute to glial scarring. Histone H1's effect on migration of astrocytes, astrocytic gene expression and motoneuronal survival was determined using scratch-wounded astroglial monolayer cultures, astrocyte cultures for microarray analysis, and motoneuron cell culture under oxidative stress conditions, respectively. Histone H1 application improves locomotor functions and enhances monoaminergic and cholinergic reinnervation of the spinal cord. Expression levels of GFAP and NG2 around the lesion site were decreased in histone H1-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated mice six weeks after injury. Histone H1 reduced astrocytic migration, changed the shape of GFAP- and NG2-positive glial cells and altered gene expression. Gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that in particular genes coding for proteins involved in proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis are dysregulated. The up- and down-regulation of distinct genes was confirmed by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Moreover, histone H1 reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death of cultured motoneurons. The combined observations indicate that histone H1 locally applied to the lesion site, improves regeneration after spinal cord injury. Some of these beneficial functions of histone H1 in vivo and in vitro can be attributed to its interaction with PSA-carrying neural cell adhesion molecule."

Next, CONPs are administered at various does (50-4000 µg mL-1) to a contused spinal cord rat model and monitored the disease progression for up to eight weeks. At one day postinjury, the number of iNOS+ cells decreases in the treated groups compared with the control. At one week, the cavity size and inflammatory cells are substantially reduced, and the expression of proinflammatory and apoptotic molecules is downregulated with a concurrent upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine. By eight weeks, the treated groups show significantly improved locomotor functions compared with the control.

In this study, DPCs were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) for 5-6 consecutive serial passages and were transplanted into the injury site immediately after complete transection of the rat spinal cord. FGF2 priming facilitated the DPCs to promote axonal regeneration and to improve locomotor function in the rat with spinal cord injury (SCI). Additional analyses revealed that FGF2 priming protected cultured DPCs from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death and increased the number of DPCs in the SCI rat spinal cord even 7 weeks after transplantation. The production of major neurotrophic factors was equivalent in FGF2-treated and untreated DPCs. These observations suggest that FGF2 priming might protect DPCs from the post-trauma microenvironment in which DPCs infiltrate and resident immune cells generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Surviving DPCs could increase the availability of neurotrophic factors in the lesion site, thereby promoting axonal regeneration and locomotor function recovery."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs in the early stages of SCI and affects prognosis and cell survival. However, the relationship between ER stress and the integrity of BSCB in diabetic rats after SCI remains unclear. Here we observed that diabetic rats showed increased extravasation of Evans Blue (EB) dye, and loss of endothelial cells and pericytes 1 day after SCI compared to non-diabetic rats. Diabetes was also shown to induce activation of ER stress. Similar effects were observed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an ER stress inhibitor lowered the adverse effect of diabetes on SCI, reduced EB dye extravasation, and limited the loss of endothelial cells and pericytes. Moreover, 4-PBA treatment partially reversed the degradation of tight junction and adherens junction both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, diabetes exacerbates the disruption of BSCB after SCI via inducing ER stress, and inhibition of ER stress by 4-PBA may play a beneficial role on the integrity of BSCB in diabetic SCI rats, leading to improved prognosis."

This interaction triggers intracellular signaling events leading to increased hydrogen peroxide levels which in turn promote filamentous actin (F-actin) destabilization and subsequent inhibition of axonal re-growth. In the current study, we demonstrated that treatment with galectin-1 (Gal-1), in its dimeric form, promotes a decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and F-actin repolimerization in the growth cone and in the filopodium of neuron surfaces. This effect was dependent on the carbohydrate recognition activity of Gal-1, as it was prevented using a Gal-1 mutant lacking carbohydrate-binding activity. Furthermore, Gal-1 promoted its own active ligand-mediated endocytosis together with the PlexinA4 receptor, through mechanisms involving complex branched N-glycans. In summary, our results suggest that Gal-1, mainly in its dimeric form, promotes re-activation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics via internalization of the PlexinA4/Gal-1 complex. This mechanism could explain, at least in part, critical events in axonal regeneration including the full axonal re-growth process, de novo formation of synapse clustering, axonal re-myelination and functional recovery of coordinated locomotor activities in an in vivo acute and chronic SCI model. Axonal regeneration is a response of injured nerve cells critical for nerve repair in human spinal cord injury. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling nerve repair by Galectin-1, may be critical for therapeutic intervention. Our results show that Galectin-1; in its dimeric form, interferes with hydrogen peroxide production triggered by Semaphorin3A. The high levels of this reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to be the main factor preventing axonal regeneration due to promotion of actin depolymerization at the axonal growth cone. Thus, Galectin-1 administration emerges as a novel therapeutic modality for promoting nerve repair and preventing axonal loss."

HO-1 expression, inflammasome activation, and the presence of inflammatory cytokines were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistological staining, immunoblot, and immunoprecipitation. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. The hindlimb locomotor function was evaluated for extent of neurologic damage. In an in vitro model, hydrogen peroxide was used to induce similar inflammasome activation in cultured primary spinal cord neurons, followed by evaluation of above parameters with or without transduction of HO-1-expressing adeno-associated virus. Endogenous HO-1 expression was found in spinal cord neurons after SCI in vivo, in association with the expression of Nod-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) and the formation of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Administration of HO-1-expressing adeno-associated virus effectively decreased expression of NLRP1, therefore alleviating NLRP1 inflammasome-induced neuronal death and improving functional recovery. In the in vitro model, exogenous HO-1 expression protected neurons from hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal death by inhibiting NLRP1 expression. In addition, HO-1 inhibited expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which is a transcription factor regulating NLRP1 expression.

Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that the protective function of E2 was related to the suppression of LC3II and beclin-1 expression. Immunohistochemical study further confirmed that the immunoreactivity of LC3 in the motor neurons was down-regulated when treated with E2. In vitro studies demonstrated similar results that E2 pretreatment decreased the autophagic activity induced by rapamycin (autophagy sensitizer) and increased viability in a PC12 cell model.

In this study, using nerve growth factor-differentiated neuronal-like Neuroscreen-1 cells, we show that extremely low concentrations of unfractionated green tea polyphenol mixture (GTPP) and its active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), prevent both the neurite outgrowth-inhibiting activity and growth cone-collapsing activity of Nogo-66 (C-terminal domain of Nogo-A). Furthermore, a synergistic interaction was observed among GTPP constituents. This preventive effect was dependent on 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) to which EGCG binds with high affinity. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and cell-permeable catalase abolished this preventive effect of GTPP and EGCG, suggesting the involvement of sublethal levels of H2 O2 in this process. Accordingly, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H2 O2 , added as a bolus dose (5 μM) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1-2 μM), mimicked GTPP in counteracting the action of Nogo-66. Exogenous H2 O2 mediated this action by bypassing the requirement of 67LR. Taken together, these results show for the first time that GTPP and EGCG, acting through 67LR and elevating intracellular sublethal levels of H2 O2 , inhibit the antineuritogenic action of Nogo-A. Currently, several agents are being evaluated for overcoming axonal growth inhibitors to promote functional recovery after stroke and spinal cord injury. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), present in green tea polyphenol mixture (GTPP), prevents antineuritogenic activity of Nogo-A, a myelin-derived axonal growth inhibitor. The preventive action of EGCG involves the cell-surface-associated 67-kDa laminin receptor and H2 O2 . GTPP may complement ongoing efforts to treat neuronal injuries.>"

SCO (subcommissural organ)-spondin is a protein secreted early by the developing central nervous system, potentially involved in the development of commissural fibers. SCO-spondin stimulates neuronal differentiation and neurite growth in vitro. NX210 oligopeptide was designed from SCO-spondin's specific thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) sequences that support the main neurogenic properties of the molecule. The objective of this work was to assess the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties of NX210 in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). In vitro studies were carried out on the B104 neuroblastoma cell line demonstrating neuroprotection by the resistance to oxidative damage using hydrogen peroxide and the measure of cell viability by metabolic activity. In vivo studies were performed in two rat models of SCI: (1) a model of aspiration of dorsal funiculi followed by the insertion of a collagen tube in situ to limit collateral sprouting; white matter regeneration was assessed using neurofilament immunostaining; (2) a rat spinal cord contusion model to assess functional recovery using BBB scale and reflex testing. We demonstrate for the first time that NX210 (a) provides neuroprotection to oxidative stress in the B104 neuroblastoma cells, (b) stimulates axonal regrowth in longitudinally oriented neofibers in the aspiration model of SCI and (c) significantly improves functional recovery in the contusive model of SCI."

However, the low survival rate of the grafted cells is a major obstacle hindering clinical success because of ongoing secondary injury processes, which includes excitotoxicity, inflammation and oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that 17b-estradiol (E2) protects several cell types against cytotoxicity. Thus, we examined the effects of E2 on the viability of human eyelid adipose-derived stem cells (hEASCs) in vitro with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced cell model and in vivo within a rat SCI model. Our results showed that E2 protected hEASCs against H₂O₂-induced cell death in vitro, and enhanced the survival of grafted hEASCs in vivo by reducing apoptosis. Additionally, E2 also enhanced the secretion of growth factors by hEASCs, thereby making the local microenvironment more conducive for tissue regeneration. Overall, E2 administration enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hEASCs transplantation and facilitated motor function recovery after SCI. Hence, E2 administration may be an intervention of choice for enhancing survival of transplanted hEASCs after SCI."

We investigated the effects of a polyurethane-based reverse thermal gel, poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(serinol hexamethylene urethane) (ESHU) on bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) transplant survival and repair using a rat model of spinal cord contusion. Transplantation of BMSCs in ESHU at three days post-contusion resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in BMSC survival at one week post-injury and a 66% increase in spared nervous tissue volume at four weeks post-injury. These improvements were accompanied by enhanced hindlimb motor and sensorimotor recovery. In vitro, we found that ESHU protected BMSCs from hydrogen peroxide-mediated death, resulting in a four-fold increase in BMSC survival with two-fold fewer BMSCs expressing the apoptosis marker, caspase 3 and the DNA oxidation marker, 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine. We argue that ESHU protected BMSCs transplanted is a spinal cord contusion from death thereby augmenting their effects on neuroprotection leading to improved behavioral restoration. The data show that the repair effects of intraneural BMSC transplants depend on the degree of their survival and may have a widespread impact on cell-based regenerative medicine."

Removal of reactive species may reduce secondary damage following SCI. This study explored the effectiveness of a catalytic antioxidant - Mn (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) - in removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress, and improving functional recovery in vivo in a rat impact SCI model. The efficiency of MnTBAP was also compared with that of methylprednisolone - the only drug used clinically in treating acute SCI. In vivo measurements of time courses of ROS production by microdialysis and microcannula sampling in MnTBAP, methylprednisolone, and saline (as vehicle control)-treated SCI rats showed that both agents significantly reduced the production of hydrogen peroxide, but only MnTBAP significantly reduced superoxide elevation after SCI. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that MnTBAP scavenged both of the preceding ROS, whereas methylprednisolone had no effect on either. By counting the immuno-positive neurons in the spinal cord sections immunohistochemically stained with anti-nitrotyrosine and anti-4-hydroxy-nonenal antibodies as the markers of protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation, we demonstrated that MnTBAP significantly reduced the numbers of 4-hydroxy-nonenal-positive and nitrotyrosine-positive neurons in the sections at 1.55 to 2.55 mm and 1.1 to 3.1 mm, respectively, rostral to the injury epicenter compared to the vehicle-treated animals. By behavioral tests (open field and inclined plane tests), we demonstrated that at 4 hours post-SCI treatment with MnTBAP and the standard methylprednisolone regimen both significantly increased test scores compared to those produced by vehicle treatment. However, the outcomes for MnTBAP-treated rats were significantly better than those for methylprednisolone-treated animals. This study demonstrated for the first time in vivo and in vitro that MnTBAP significantly reduced the levels of SCI-elevated ROS and that MnTBAP is superior to methylprednisolone in removing ROS. Removal of ROS by MnTBAP significantly reduced protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation in neurons. MnTBAP more effectively reduced neurological deficits than did methylprednisolone after SCI - the first most important criterion for assessing SCI treatments. These results support the therapeutic potential of MnTBAP in treating SCI."

MMP-2 promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) by regulating the formation of a glial scar. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression and/or activity of several MMPs, after SCI and human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cell (hUCB) treatment in rats with a special emphasis on MMP-2. Treatment with hUCB after SCI altered the expression of several MMPs in rats. MMP-2 is upregulated after hUCB treatment in spinal cord injured rats and in spinal neurons injured either with staurosporine or hydrogen peroxide. Further, hUCB induced upregulation of MMP-2 reduced formation of the glial scar at the site of injury along with reduced immunoreactivity to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Blockade of MMP-2 activity in hUCB cocultured injured spinal neurons reduced the protection offered by hUCB which indicated the involvement of MMP-2 in the neuroprotection offered by hUCB. Based on these results, we conclude that hUCB treatment after SCI upregulates MMP-2 levels and reduces the formation of the glial scar thereby creating an environment suitable for endogenous repair mechanisms."

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model. Its efficacy may facilitate the development of novel drug targets for the treatment of SCI."

However, activation of various physiological mechanisms secondary to the initial trauma including edema, inflammation, excito-toxicity, excessive cytokine release and apoptosis may exacerbate the injury and/or retard natural repair mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSCs) inhibits H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis of cultured spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulting in increased cell survival. The ATSC extracts mediated this effect by decreasing caspase-3 and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activity, inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria and reducing Bax expression levels in cells. Direct injection of ATSC extracts mixed with Matrigel into the spinal cord immediately after SCI also resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death, astrogliosis and hypo-myelination but did not reduce the extent of microglia infiltration. Moreover, animals injected with the ATSC extract showed significant functional improvement of hind limbs as measured by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale. Collectively, these studies show a prominent therapeutic effect of ATSC cytoplasmic extracts on SCI principally caused by an inhibition of apoptosis-mediated cell death, which spares white matter, oligodendrocytes and neurons at the site of injury. The ability of ATSC extracts to prevent secondary pathological events and improve neurologic function after SCI suggests that extracts prepared from autologous cells harvested from SCI patients may have clinical utility."

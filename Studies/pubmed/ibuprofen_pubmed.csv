Spinal cord injury (SCI) will cause loss of physical function and dysfunction below the injury site, causing them to lose sensation and mobility, thereby reducing the quality of life of patients. Although regular rehabilitation management can reduce its severity, the current effective treatment methods are limited to the treatment of secondary injuries to SCI. The purpose of treatment should not only include the restoration of the histology of the lesion, but also should focus on the restoration of sensory and mobility and. The key to effective treatment is to reduce secondary injuries. RhoA inhibitor can improve the pathophysiological changes related to secondary injury and promote the recovery of activity ability, so it may become a clinical drug for the treatment of SCI. This article systematically analyzed the effects of RhoA inhibitors on the promotion of axon regeneration and the recovery of mobility and compared the therapeutic effects of different inhibitors on SCI and their effects on physical function recovery. We used a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the effects of Rho inhibitors on SCI treatment and the recovery of body function. 21 articles (738 animals) were identified in the literatures search. Studies were selected if they reported the therapeutic effects of RhoA/ROCK inhibitors (BA-210, EGCG, β-elemene, C3-exoenzmye, LINGO-1-Fc, Ibuprofen, SiRhoA, iRhoA + FK506, Fasudil, p21Cip1/WAF1, HA-1007, Y-27,632 and C3bot154-182). We measure the functional recovery by BBB and BMS scores. The random effect model of weighted mean difference (WMD, 95 % confidence interval) was used to analyze the effects. The WMD of the forest graph was 2.277; 95 % CI: 1.705∼2.849, P < 0.001, suggesting that RhoA inhibitors can effectively treat SCI. In addition to EGCG, all the other agents also showed the effects on the activity recovery post-SCI (P < 0.05). β-elemene, LINGO-1-Fc, Ibuprofen, SiRhoA, RhoA + FK506, Fasudil, p21Cip1/WAF1 and Y-27,632 have similar effects to BA-210, they can promote axon germination and nerve fiber regeneration after thoracic spinal cord injury and reduce the formation of syringomyelia and protect white matter, thereby improving locomotor recovery. RhoA inhibitors have great potential to restore motor function and provide a new trend for the treatment of SCI."

We designed a treatment solution based on an implantable biomaterial (electrospun poly (l-lactic acid) [PLLA]) loaded with ibuprofen and triiodothyronine (T3) to counteract inflammation, thus improving endogenous regeneration. In vivo efficacy was tested by implanting the drug-loaded PLLA in the rat model of T8 contusion SCI. We observed the expected recovery of locomotion beginning on day 7. In PLLA-implanted rats (i.e., controls), the recovery stabilized at 21 days post-lesion (DPL), after which no further improvement was observed. On the contrary, in PLLA + ibuprofen (Ibu) + T3 (PLLA-Ibu-T3) rats a further recovery and a significant treatment effect were observed, also confirmed by the gait analysis on 49 DPL. Glutamate release at 24 h and 8 DPL was reduced in PLLA-Ibu-T3- compared to PLLA-implanted rats, such as the estimated lesion volume at 60 DPL. The myelin- and 200-neurofilament-positive area fraction was higher in PLLA-Ibu-T3-implanted rats, where the percentage of astrocytes was significantly reduced. The implant of a PLLA electrospun scaffold loaded with Ibu and T3 significantly improves the endogenous regeneration, leading to an improvement of functional locomotion outcome in the SCI."

The ibuprofen modified dextran was synthesized using a direct esterification linkage between the carboxylic acids of hydrophobic drug and the hydroxyl groups of the polymer backbone. The morphology of methylprednisolone loaded nanoparticles was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The therapeutic efficacy of the prepared nanoparticles on the acute SCI model rats was assessed. It is demonstrated that methylprednisolone loaded ibuprofen modified dextran based nanoparticles (MP-loaded NPs) could promote the recovery of neurological deficits, enhance growth of neurons, decrease degeneration of injuried neurons and reduce the tissue tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels significantly in the SCI rats. Subsequently, the study indicates that synthesis of methylprednisolone loaded ibuprofen modified dextran based nanoparticles has a great potential in the synergetic effect treatment for spinal cord injury and nanoparticles based drug delivery system will become a powerful weapon of human conquest of disease."

Preclinical studies on spinal cord injury (SCI) imply improved motor recovery after ibuprofen/indometacin-mediated Rho inhibition. This has been reassessed by a meta-analysis of the underlying experimental evidence, which indicates an overall effect size of 20.2% regarding motor outcome achieved after ibuprofen/indometacin treatment compared with vehicle controls. In addition, ibuprofen/indometacin may also limit sickness behaviour, non-neurogenic systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), neuropathic pain and heterotopic ossifications after SCI. Consequently, 'small molecule'-mediated Rho inhibition after acute SCI warrants clinical investigation. Protocol of an investigator-initiated clinical open-label pilot trial on high-dose ibuprofen treatment after acute traumatic, motor-complete SCI. A sample of n=12 patients will be enrolled in two cohorts treated with 2400 mg/day ibuprofen for 4 or 12 weeks, respectively. The primary safety end point is an occurrence of serious adverse events, primarily gastroduodenal bleedings. Secondary end points are pharmacokinetics, feasibility and preliminary effects on neurological recovery, neuropathic pain and heterotopic ossifications. The primary safety analysis is based on the incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleedings. Additional analyses will be mainly descriptive and casuistic. The clinical trial protocol was approved by the responsible German state Ethics Board, and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good Clinical Practice and all further applicable regulations. This safety and pharmacokinetics trial informs the planning of a subsequent randomised controlled trial. Regardless of the result of the primary and secondary outcome assessments, the clinical trial will be reported as a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. NCT02096913; Pre-results."

Therefore, we employed a rat model of cervical SCI to evaluate the combination of four noninvasive treatments that individually have been reported to be effective for acute SCI during clinically relevant therapeutic time windows. These treatments included ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and ketogenic diet (KD). These were selected not only because of their previously reported efficacy in SCI models but also for their potentially different mechanisms of action. The administration of ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD several hours to days postinjury was based on previous observations by others that each treatment had profound effects on the pathophysiology and functional outcome following SCI. Here we showed that, with the exception of a modest improvement in performance on the Montoya staircase test at 8-10 weeks postinjury, the combinatorial treatment with ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD did not result in any significant improvements in the rearing test, grooming test, or horizontal ladder. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords did not reveal any significant differences in tissue sparing between treatment and control groups. Although single approaches of ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD have been reported to be beneficial after SCI, our results show that the combination of the four interventions did not confer significant functional or histological improvements in a cervical model of SCI. Possible interactions among the treatments may have negated their beneficial effects, emphasizing the challenges that have to be addressed when considering combinatorial drug therapies for SCI."

Pooling preclinical evidence by orthodox meta-analysis is confounded by missing data (publication bias). To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RhoA/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) blocking approaches to (1) analyze the impact of bias that may lead to inflated effect sizes and (2) determine the normalized effect size of functional locomotor recovery after experimental thoracic SCI. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science and hand searched related references. Studies were selected if they reported the effect of RhoA/ROCK inhibitors (C3-exoenzmye, fasudil, Y-27632, ibuprofen, siRhoA, and p21) in experimental spinal cord hemisection, contusion, or transection on locomotor recovery measured by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score or the Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion. Two investigators independently assessed the identified studies. Details of individual study characteristics from each publication were extracted and effect sizes pooled using a random effects model. We assessed risk for bias using a 9-point-item quality checklist and calculated publication bias with Egger regression and the trim and fill method. A stratified meta-analysis was used to assess the impact of study characteristics on locomotor recovery. Thirty studies (725 animals) were identified. RhoA/ROCK inhibition was found to improve locomotor outcome by 21% (95% CI, 16.0-26.6). Assessment of publication bias by the trim and fill method suggested that 30% of experiments remain unpublished. Inclusion of these theoretical missing studies suggested a 27% overestimation of efficacy, reducing the overall efficacy to a 15% improvement in locomotor recovery. Low study quality was associated with larger estimates of neurobehavioral outcome. Taking into account publication bias, RhoA/ROCK inhibition improves functional outcome in experimental SCI by 15%. This is a plausible strategy for the pharmacological augmentation of neurorehabilitation after human SCI. These findings support the necessity of a systematic analysis to identify preclinical bias before embarking on a clinical trial."

Its main effects are mediated by non-specific inhibition of COX enzymes, but it also exerts some COX-independent effects, such as the inhibition of RhoA signaling and the modulation of glial activity. These effects have boosted the use of ibuprofen as a tool to promote axonal regeneration and to increase functional recovery after neural injuries, although with controversial results showing positive and negative outcomes of ibuprofen treatment in several experimental models. We have evaluated the effects of ibuprofen administered at 60 mg/kg twice a day to rats subjected to a mild spinal cord contusion. Our results indicate that ibuprofen ameliorates mechanical hyperalgesia in rats by reducing central hyperexcitability, but failed to produce improvements in the recovery of locomotion. Despite an early effect on reducing microglial reactivity, the ibuprofen treatment did not provide histological evidence of neuroprotection; indeed the volume of cord tissue spared rostral to the lesion was decreased in ibuprofen treated rats. In summary, the early modulation of neuroinflammation produced by the administration of ibuprofen seems to eventually lead to a worse resolution of detrimental events occurring in the secondary injury phase, but also to reduce the development of neuropathic pain."

We carried out 3 separate experiments in which young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats received dorsal over-hemisections at T6-T7, and then were implanted with osmotic minipumps for subcutaneous delivery of ibuprofen or saline. Motor function was assessed with the BBB Locomotor Rating Scale, footprint analysis, and with a grid walk task. Combined group sizes for functional analyses were n=34 rats treated with ibuprofen and n=39 controls. Bladder function was assessed by measuring the amount of urine retained in the bladder twice per day. Four weeks post-injury, CST axons were traced by injecting BDA into the sensorimotor cortex; 5HT axons were assessed by immunostaining. Analysis of data from all rats revealed no significant differences between groups. Analysis of data excluding rats with lesions that were larger than intended indicated improved locomotor function in ibuprofen-treated rats at early post-lesion intervals in one of the individual experiments. Rats that received Ibuprofen did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in bladder function. Quantitative analyses of CST and 5HT axon distribution also did not reveal differences between ibuprofen-treated and control rats. Taken together, our results only partially replicate the findings that treatment with ibuprofen improves motor function after SCI but fail to replicate findings regarding enhanced axon growth."

The small GTPase RhoA is a key molecule of the converging downstream cascade that leads to the inhibition of axonal re-growth. The Rho-pathway integrates growth inhibitory signals derived from extracellular cues, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, Ephrins and repulsive guidance molecule-A, into the damaged axon. Consequently, the activation of RhoA results in growth cone collapse and finally outgrowth failure. In turn, the inhibition of RhoA-activation blinds the injured axon to its growth inhibitory environment resulting in enhanced axonal sprouting and plasticity. This has been demonstrated in various CNS-injury models for direct RhoA-inhibition and for downstream/upstream blockade of the RhoA-associated pathway. In addition, RhoA-inhibition reduces apoptotic cell death and secondary damage and improves locomotor recovery in clinically relevant models after experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). Unexpectedly, a subset of ""small molecules"" from the group of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly the FDA-approved ibuprofen, has recently been identified as (1) inhibiting RhoA-activation, (2) enhancing axonal sprouting/regeneration, (3) protecting ""tissue at risk"" (neuroprotection) and (4) improving motor recovery confined to realistic therapeutical time-frames in clinically relevant SCI models. Here, we survey the effect of small-molecule-induced RhoA-inhibition on axonal plasticity and neurofunctional outcome in CNS injury paradigms. Furthermore, we discuss the body of preclinical evidence for a possible clinical translation with a focus on ibuprofen and illustrate putative risks and benefits for the treatment of acute SCI."

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals."

Unlike most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen suppresses basal RhoA activity (Zhou et al., 2003). A recent report suggested that ibuprofen promotes corticospinal axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (Fu et al., 2007). Here, we confirm that ibuprofen reduces ligand-induced Rho signaling and myelin-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro. Following 4 weeks of subcutaneous administration of ibuprofen, beginning 3 days after spinal cord contusion, animals recovered walking function to a greater degree, with twice as many rats achieving a hind limb weight-bearing status. We examined the relative role of tissue sparing, axonal sprouting, and axonal regeneration in the action of ibuprofen. Histologically, ibuprofen-treated animals display an increase in spared tissue without an alteration in astrocytic or microglial reaction. Ibuprofen increases axonal sprouting from serotonergic raphespinal axons, and from rostral corticospinal fibers in the injured spinal cord, but does not permit caudal corticospinal regeneration after spinal contusion. Treatment of mice with complete spinal cord transection demonstrates long-distance raphespinal axon regeneration in the presence of ibuprofen. Thus, administration of ibuprofen improves the recovery of rats from a clinically relevant spinal cord trauma by protecting tissue, stimulating axonal sprouting, and allowing a minor degree of raphespinal regeneration."

Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma. In contrast, the non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have the axon growth-promoting effects on cultured or lesioned neurons.

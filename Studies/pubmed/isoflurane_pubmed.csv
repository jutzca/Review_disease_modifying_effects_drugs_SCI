However, most previous studies were performed under anesthesia, which significantly alters respiratory network. Therefore, the goal of this work was to assess spontaneous diaphragm recovery post-C2Hx in awake, freely behaving animals. Adult rats were chronically implanted with diaphragm EMG electrodes and recorded during 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Our results reveal that ipsilateral diaphragm activity partially recovers within days post-injury and reaches pre-injury amplitude in a few weeks. However, the full extent of spontaneous ipsilateral recovery is significantly attenuated by anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane). This suggests that the observed recovery may be attributed in part to activation of NMDA receptors which are suppressed by anesthesia. Despite spontaneous recovery in awake animals, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm dysfunction still persists: i) Inspiratory bursts during basal (slow) breathing exhibit an altered pattern, ii) the amplitude of sighs - or augmented breaths - is significantly decreased, and iii) the injured hemidiaphragm exhibits spontaneous events of hyperexcitation. The results from this study offer an under-appreciated insight into spontaneous diaphragm activity and recovery following high cervical spinal cord injury in awake animals."

SCI is known to reorganize the neural circuitry of micturition reflex after injury. Under isoflurane anesthesia, spinal cord of 18 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats was completely transected at the Th9-10 level. Awake cystometry was performed at each time point on controls and 6 SCI animals, and bladder was then harvested for analysis of 29 proteins Millipore kit or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prophylactic dose of ampicillin 100 mg/kg was administered periodically to all SCI animals. Spontaneous recovery of voiding after SCI at 12 weeks was evident from increased intercontractile interval and voiding efficiency during cystometry. Expression of proinflammatory interleukins ([IL] IL-1α and IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) and CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10), CX3CL1, and CCL2 showed significant elevation at 4 and at 8 weeks with slight decrease at 12 weeks. In contrast, expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and neuroprotective factors, CXCL-5, and leptin, was elevated at 8 and at 12 weeks (P < .05). In contrast, expression of CCL3, CCL5, and growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) did not show any significant temporal change after SCI. Spontaneous recovery of reflex voiding at 12 weeks was marked by increased endogenous expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and neuroprotective factors, CXCL-5, and leptin, which suggests that pharmacological suppression of inflammation, can hasten the emergence of reflex voiding after SCI."

Severe compression SCI at low-thoracic level (T8) in adult female Wistar rats was followed by WBV twice a day (2 × WBV) over a 12-week post-injury period. Intact rats and rats with SCI but no WBV-therapy (""No-WBV"") served as controls. Recovery of locomotion was determined by BBB-locomotor rating, foot stepping angle (FSA), rump-height index (RHI), correct ladder steps (CLS) and H-reflex at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks after SCI. Animals were sacrificed by an overdose of Isoflurane (Abbott). One hour later their spinal cords were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h. Samples from the thoracic cord containing the lesion site and from the lumbar intumescence were cut into 10 μm thick longitudinal frozen sections. All functioning capillaries were unequivocally identified because the endogenous peroxidase of the erythrocytes was clearly visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB). A determination of their absolute (in μm2) and proportional areas (percent of photographed tissue) revealed a significantly denser capillary network in the WBV-treated rats: 1,66 ± 0,41% in the ""vibrated"" rats versus 0,79 ± 0,19% in the ""No-WBV"" animals. The portion of the capillary network in intact rats was 1,51 ± 0,69%. Surprisingly, even though the vascularization in the treated animals was significantly increased, this had no beneficial influence on the recovery of functions after SCI. The results of this study provide for the first time evidence that intensive WBV-therapy leads to a significantly denser capillary network in the lesioned spinal cord. However, since this higher capillary density is not associated with improved functional recovery (possibly because it exceeded the balance necessary for functional improvements), optional treatments with lower intensity or less time of WBV-therapy should be tested."

ISMS within the cervical and lumbar spinal cord is capable of evoking a variety of highly-functional movements prior to injury, but the ability of ISMS to evoke forelimb movements after cervical spinal cord injury is unknown. Here we examine the forelimb movements and muscles activated by cervical ISMS both before and after contusion injury. We documented the forelimb muscles activated and movements evoked via systematic stimulation of the rodent cervical spinal cord both before injury and three, six and nine weeks following a moderate C4/C5 lateralized contusion injury. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane to permit construction of somatotopic maps of evoked movements and quantify evoked muscle synergies between cervical segments C3 and T1. When ISMS was delivered to the cervical spinal cord, a variety of responses were observed at 68% of locations tested, with a spatial distribution that generally corresponded to the location of motor neuron pools. Stimulus currents required to achieve movement and the number of sites where movements could be evoked were unchanged by spinal cord injury. A transient shift toward extension-dominated movements and restricted muscle synergies were observed at three and six weeks following injury, respectively. By nine weeks after injury, however, ISMS-evoked patterns were similar to spinally-intact animals. The results demonstrate the potential for cervical ISMS to reanimate hand and arm function following spinal cord injury. Robust forelimb movements can be evoked both before and during the chronic stages of recovery from a clinically relevant and sustained cervical contusion injury."

This is the first study to show how two commonly used anesthetics affect continuously recorded hemodynamic parameters and locomotor recovery during a 2-week period after two levels of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We hypothesized that the level of cardiovascular depression and recovery of locomotor function would be dependent upon the anesthetic used during SCI. Thirty-two adult female rats were subjected to a sham, 25-mm or 50-mm SCI at T3-4 under pentobarbital or isoflurane anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were telemetrically recorded before, during, and after SCI. Locomotor function recovered best in the 25-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. There was no significant difference in locomotor recovery between the 25-mm-injured pentobarbital-anesthetized animals and the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. White matter sparing and extent of intermediolateral cell column loss appeared larger in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, but this was not significant. There were no differential effects of anesthetics on HR and MAP before SCI, but recovery from anesthesia was significantly slower in pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. At the time of SCI, MAP was acutely elevated in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, whereas MAP decreased in the isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Hypotension occurred in the pentobarbital-anesthetized groups and in the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized group. In pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, SCI resulted in acute elevation of HR, although HR remained low. Return of HR to baseline was much slower in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. Severe SCI at T3 produced significant chronic tachycardia that was injury severity dependent. Although some laboratories monitor blood pressure, HR, and other physiological variables during surgery for SCI, inherently few have monitored cardiovascular function during recovery. This study shows that anesthetics affect hemodynamic parameters differently, which in turn can affect functional outcome measures. This supports the need for a careful evaluation of cardiovascular and other physiological measures in experimental models of SCI. Choice of anesthetic should be an important consideration in experimental designs and data analyses."

Exogenous acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is metabolized in the brain to acetyl coenzyme A and subsequently enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. ALCAR administration is neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury, but has not been tested for TBI. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with ALCAR during the first 24 h following TBI in immature rats improves neurologic outcome and reduces cortical lesion volume. Postnatal day 21-22 male rats were isoflurane anesthetized and used in a controlled cortical impact model of TBI to the left parietal cortex. At 1, 4, 12 and 23 h after injury, rats received ALCAR (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or drug vehicle (normal saline). On days 3-7 after surgery, behavior was assessed using beam walking and novel object recognition tests. On day 7, rats were transcardially perfused and brains were harvested for histological assessment of cortical lesion volume, using stereology. Injured animals displayed a significant increase in foot slips compared to sham-operated rats (6 ± 1 SEM vs. 2 ± 0.2 on day 3 after trauma; n = 7; p < 0.05). The ALCAR-treated rats were not different from shams and had fewer foot slips compared to vehicle-treated animals (2 ± 0.4; n = 7; p< 0.05). The frequency of investigating a novel object for saline-treated TBI animals was reduced compared to shams (45 ± 5% vs. 65 ± 10%; n = 7; p < 0.05), whereas the frequency of investigation for TBI rats treated with ALCAR was not significantly different from that of shams but significantly higher than that of saline-treated TBI rats (68 ± 7; p < 0.05). The left parietal cortical lesion volume, expressed as a percentage of the volume of tissue in the right hemisphere, was significantly smaller in ALCAR-treated than in vehicle-treated TBI rats (14 ± 5% vs. 28 ± 6%; p < 0.05). We conclude that treatment with ALCAR during the first 24 h after TBI improves behavioral outcomes and reduces brain lesion volume in immature rats within the first 7 days after injury."

Transient blockage of the CD11d/CD18 integrin has been reported to reduce secondary neuronal damage as well as to improve functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment with an anti-CD11d monoclonal antibody (mAb) would improve motor performance, reduce pain and histopathological damage in animals following clip-compression injury as reported. Adult male Wistar rats (250g) were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the T12 spinal cord exposed by T10 and T11 dorsal laminectomies followed by a 60s period of clip compression utilizing a 35g clip. Control animals received an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody (1B7) while the treated group received the anti-CD11d mAb (217L; 1.0mg/kg) systemically. Open-field locomotion and sensory function were assessed and animals were perfusion-fixed at twelve weeks after injury for quantitative histopathological analysis. As compared to 1B7, 217L treated animals showed an overall non-significant trend to better motor recovery. All animals showed chronic mechanical allodynia and anti-CD11d mAb treatment did not significantly prevent its development. Histopathological analysis demonstrated severe injury to gray and white matter after compression with a non-significant trend in anti-CD11d protection compared to control animals for preserved myelin. Although positive effects with the anti-CD11d mAb treatment have been reported after compressive SCI, it is suggested that this potential treatment requires further investigation before clinical trials in spinal cord injured patients are implemented."

Here, we use a simple outcome measure (volume of retained urine) to assess bladder dysfunction over time following moderate contusion injuries at 3 different thoracic levels (T1, T4, or T9) and complete crush injuries (T1 vs. T9). The volume of urine retained in the bladder was measured daily for fourteen days post injury by anesthetizing the animals with isoflurane, expressing the bladder, and weighing the urine. To compare bladder deficits with the degree of impairment of hindlimb motor function, locomotion was assessed using the BBB open field rating scale. Rats with contusions at T4 and T9 exhibited bladder impairments reflected by increased urine retention from 1 to 12 days post injury. In contrast, rats with contusions at T1 exhibited minimal deficits (smaller volumes of retained urine). Lesion size and overall functional impairment were comparable between groups based on quantitative assessments of lesion area at the epicenter and BBB locomotor scores. Moreover, a sector analysis of sparing of different portions of the white matter revealed no differences in sparing of different funiculi between the groups. Injections of Fluorogold into lumbar segments led to retrograde labeling of a larger number of neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC) following T1 injury when compared to T4 or T9. Thus, moderate contusion lesions at T1 spare a critical descending pathway able to mediate at least reflex voiding in rats."

This study examines the responses of OPN knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice to spinal cord contusion injury. KO and WT mice were injured with a modified New York University impactor. Weights of 10 or 5.6 g were dropped 6.25 mm onto the T13 spinal cord under isoflurane anesthesia. At 24 h, homogenized spinal cords were analyzed for total potassium concentration to estimate lesion volumes. Expression of apoptotic genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and nerve growth factors was measured by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot. In a series of animals, locomotor recovery was assessed with the Basso mouse scale (BMS) for 6 weeks, and histological analyses was performed to determine tissue preservation. Lesion volume showed no significant differences between KO and WT mice at 24 h. RT-PCR indicated that KO mice had significantly less Bcl-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 mRNA compared with WT controls. Western blot also showed that KO had significantly less Bcl-2 7 d after spinal cord injury. KO mice had significantly worse BMS locomotor scores than WT at 6 weeks. KO mice also had a significantly reduced area of spared white matter and fewer neuronal-specific nuclear protein-positive neurons in the spinal cord surrounding the impact site. This result supports a potential neuroprotective role for OPN in the inflammatory response to spinal cord injury."

The authors determined the isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) necessary to block movement in response to supramaximal noxious stimulation, as well as tail-flick and hind paw withdrawal latencies, before and up to 28 days after thoracic spinal transection. Tail-flick and hind paw withdrawal latencies were measured in the awake state to test for the presence of spinal shock or hyperreflexia. The authors measured limb forces elicited by noxious mechanical stimulation of a paw or the tail at 28 days after transection. Limb force experiments were also conducted in other animals that received a reversible spinal conduction block by cooling the spinal cord at the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra. A large decrease in MAC (to </= 40% of pretransection values) occurred after spinal transection, with partial recovery (to approximately 60% of control) at 14-28 days after transection. Awake tail-flick and hind paw withdrawal latencies were facilitated or unchanged, whereas reflex latencies under isoflurane were depressed or absent. However, at 80-90% of MAC, noxious stimulation of the hind paw elicited ipsilateral limb withdrawals in all animals. Hind limb forces were reduced (by >/= 90%) in both chronic and acute cold-block spinal animals. The immobilizing potency of isoflurane increases substantially after spinal transection, despite the absence of a baseline motor depression, or ""spinal shock."" Therefore, isoflurane MAC is determined by a spinal depressant action, possibly counteracted by a supraspinal facilitatory action. The partial recovery in MAC at later time points suggests that neuronal plasticity after spinal cord injury influences anesthetic requirements."

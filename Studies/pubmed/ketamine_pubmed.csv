However, most previous studies were performed under anesthesia, which significantly alters respiratory network. Therefore, the goal of this work was to assess spontaneous diaphragm recovery post-C2Hx in awake, freely behaving animals. Adult rats were chronically implanted with diaphragm EMG electrodes and recorded during 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Our results reveal that ipsilateral diaphragm activity partially recovers within days post-injury and reaches pre-injury amplitude in a few weeks. However, the full extent of spontaneous ipsilateral recovery is significantly attenuated by anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane). This suggests that the observed recovery may be attributed in part to activation of NMDA receptors which are suppressed by anesthesia. Despite spontaneous recovery in awake animals, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm dysfunction still persists: i) Inspiratory bursts during basal (slow) breathing exhibit an altered pattern, ii) the amplitude of sighs - or augmented breaths - is significantly decreased, and iii) the injured hemidiaphragm exhibits spontaneous events of hyperexcitation. The results from this study offer an under-appreciated insight into spontaneous diaphragm activity and recovery following high cervical spinal cord injury in awake animals."

We have recently identified the small organic compound ursolic acid (UA) as a HNK-1 mimetic with the aim to test its therapeutic potential in the central nervous system. UA, a plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid, is well known for its multiple biological functions, including neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we evaluated its functions in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying its positive effects. Oral administration of UA to mice 1 h after SCI and thereafter once daily for 6 weeks enhanced the regaining of motor functions and axonal regrowth, and decreased astrogliosis. UA administration decreased levels of proinflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, in the injured spinal cord at the acute phase of inflammation and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways in the injured spinal cord. Taken together, these results suggest that UA may be a candidate for treatment of nervous system injuries."

They were randomized and divided into four groups with eight animals in each as sham, control, SCI+PEG (polyethylene glycol) and SCI+atorvastatin group. Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and SCI was induced by the weight-drop model. A single level laminectomy was performed at T10 and the spinal column was immobilized with a stereotactic device. Rats in the treatment group received ip atorvastatin at 0.2 mg/kg. Neurological impairments were examined through Modified Tarlov's and inclined angle scores. The SCI section was resected for electron-microscopic analysis, IL-1β and IL-6 level. All data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnet T3 test. Atorvastatin improved locomotor recovery after rat SCI. The results were further confirmed with a statistically significant decrease of IL-1β, IL-6 and lipid peroxide levels. This finding revealed the anti-inflammatory and beneficial effect of atorvastatin on rat SCI. The present study focused on both B and T cell mediated immunity and confirmed the beneficial effect of atorvastatin with decreased expressions of IL-1β and IL-6."

In this study, we evaluated the effect of a calpain inhibitor, AK 295, on spinal cord structure, neurologic function, and apoptosis after spinal cord injury (SCI) in a murine model. Thirty albino Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups of 10 each: the sham-operated control group (group 1), the spinal cord trauma group (group 2), and the spinal cord trauma plus AK 295 treatment group (group 3). After having received a combination of ketamine 60 mg/kg and xylazine 9 mg/kg to induce anesthesia, the rats in groups 2 and 3 were subjected to thoracic trauma by the weight drop technique (40 g-cm). One hour after having been subjected to that trauma, the rats in groups 2 and 3 were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of either dimethyl sulfoxide 2 mg/kg or AK 295 2 mg/kg. The effects of the injury and the efficacy of AK 295 were determined by an assessment of the TUNEL technique and the results of examination with a light microscope. The neurologic performance of 5 rats from group 2 and 5 from group 3 was assessed by means of the inclined plane technique and the modified Tarlov's motor grading scale 1, 3, and 5 days after spinal cord trauma. Light-microscopic examination of spinal cord specimens from group 2 revealed hemorrhage, edema, necrosis, and vascular thrombi 24 hours after trauma. Similar (but less prominent) features were seen in specimens obtained from group 3 rats. Twenty-four hours after injury, the mean apoptotic cell numbers in groups 1 and 2 were zero and 4.57 +/- 0.37 cells, respectively. In group 3, the mean apoptotic cell number was 2.30 +/- 0.34 cells, a value significantly lower than that in group 2 (P < .05). Five days after trauma, the injured rats in group 2 demonstrated significant motor dysfunction (P < .05). In comparison, the motor scores exhibited by group 3 rats were markedly better (P < .05). AK 295 inhibited apoptosis via calpaindependent pathways and provided neuroprotection and improved neurologic function in a rat model of SCI. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the use of AK 295, a calpain inhibitor, after SCI. Our data suggest that AK 295 might be a novel therapeutic compound for the neuroprotection of tissue and the recovery of function in patients with a SCI."

The use of agmatine [4-(aminobutyl)-guanidine-NH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(-NH2)(=NH)], a guanidinium compound formed by decarboxylation of L-arginine by arginine decarboxylase, is a neurotransmitter-neuromodulator with both N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antagonizing and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-inhibiting activities. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the dose-dependent activity of agmatine, an inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor and selective NMDAR antagonist, on biochemical and functional recovery in an experimental rat SCI model. This study involved 40 Wistar albino male rats. The rats were subjected to sleep-awake cycles for 7 days before surgery. In each group, general anesthesia was induced by a 60-mg/kg ketamine injection. For the surgical SCI model, a Yaşargil aneurysm clip was placed in the spinal cord. The study was conducted in the following four main groups: Group I (control group) laminectomy only; Group II, trauma-only group and SCI; Group III, laminectomy, SCI and agmatine 50 mg/kg for 10 days; and Group IV, laminectomy, SCI, and agmatine 100 mg/kg for 10 days. On Day 1, no statistical difference was observed in any group (p < 0.005, analysis of variance [ANOVA] and the Fisher protected least significant difference [PLSD]). On Day 2, no statistical difference was noted among Groups II, III, and IV (p = 0.27, p = 0.42, and p = 0.76, respectively; ANOVA and Fisher PLSD). Beginning on Day 3, recovery in Groups III and IV differed significantly from that in Group II (p < 0.005, ANOVA and Fisher PLSD), and a statistically significant difference between Groups III and IV was observed, which also was present on Days 5, 7, and 10 (p = 0.003, p = 0.0024, and p = 0.0036, respectively; ANOVA and Fisher PLSD). Several observations were noteworthy: motor function scores were reduced significantly in the spinal cord-injured rats compared with the controls (p < 0.005); on Day 1, the agreement of motor function scores in rats in each SCI group indicated that the traumatic event had been replicated equally across all groups (p = 0.59, p = 0.59, and p = 0.28); a statistically significant difference in motor function scores developed on Day 3 between the rats subjected to trauma alone (Group II) and those treated with agmatine (Groups III and IV) (p < 0.005); and no statistically significant intergroup difference in motor function existed at any postinjury interval between the 50- and 100-mg/kg/day agmatine-treated rats (p > 0.005). Agmatine administration following SCI was shown to reduce NO levels significantly. No statistically significant intergroup difference in the reduction of NO levels was found between rats treated with 50- and 100-mg/kg/day doses of agmatine. Administration of a 100-mg/kg/day dose of agmatine reduced the NO levels to those measured in controls. The authors conclude that with additional studies into the role of agmatine, this drug may be helpful in the treatment of patients with SCIs."

The MEPs were recorded and the relationship between the variation of the MEPs and the residual locomotor capacity after spinal cord injury was analyzed. The 6 rabbits in mild-spinal-cord-injury group experienced transient attenuation of their TMS-MEPs, and the locomotor capacity remained intact (scores of 5) in almost all rabbits (5 of 6) when assessed 24 hours later; In the moderate-spinal-cord-injury group the 8 rabbits lost their TMS-MEP immediately after the weight-drop contusion, but they regained them partly in 1 hour one after another and scored 4 or 5 in the assessment of muscle power next day except for one score of 2; 8 rabbits had their spinal cords impaired severely in the contusion procedure and lost their TMS-MEP too but without recovery, their locomotor capacity outcomes were very poor, 5 of them had no response to transcranial magnetic stimulation next day, and in the other 3 rabbits we only found some polyphase waves with variant latency and lower amplitude which did not resemble common compound muscle action potential (CMAPs) evoked by TMS. Myogenic TMS-MEPs was very sensitive to the spinal cord injury and should be a valid technique for intraoperative monitoring, and a slight change of them, even if a transient lose, should be unnecessarily related to a severe movement disorder. The warning threshold for a given patient should depend on the malady itself."

Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from forearm extensor muscles after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. The SSEPs and The MEPs were measured in each animal before and after the injury under ketamine-based anesthesia. After the moderate injury (n = 7), 83% of the animals (6/7) maintained the SSEPs and 100% (7/7) maintained the MEPs. Postoperatively, only one animal who lost the SSEPs post-injury became tetraplegic. The remainder were neurologically intact. In the severely injured animals (n = 7), 5/7 of animals lost SSEPs and subsequently became tetraplegic. The MEPS were maintained in 3/5 (60%) of these tetraplegic animals. Two of seven animals (40%) in this group did not lose SSEPs or MEPs and recovered with no clinical deficit. Our data show a good correlation between the presence of SSEPs and functional recovery in the injured groups. The presence of MEPs in 3/5 (60%) of the tetraplegic animals may imply the existence of functionally active motor fibers after severe spinal trauma."

Neurologic evaluation was conducted on an inclined plane, noting the maximum angle at which an animal was able to maintain orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal midline. Scores were statistically modeled for each group to develop profiles of neurologic deficits. Rats were subjected to a 4-h exposure to isoflurane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or ketamine 7 or 8 days postimplantation. Neurologic outcomes were compared to a SCI reference group which received no postimplant anesthesia. An animal weight/desiccated implant volume (Wa/Vi) ratio of 53 to 73 g/mm3 produced postimplant neurologic deficits which deteriorated to near maximum within 3 days, followed by a gradual improvement beginning at Day 8 and returning to near normal between 21 and 25 days.

Ischemic spinal cord injury may have a similar pathophysiology and hence may respond in a similar fashion. This study was designed to investigate the effects of pretreatment with flunarizine on systemic hemodynamics, spinal cord blood flow, and neurological recovery in a rabbit model of ischemic spinal cord injury. New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and instrumented for systemic blood pressure monitoring and spinal cord blood flow measurements using the microsphere method. After pretreatment with flunarizine or vehicle, ischemic spinal cord injury was created selectively in the caudal regions of the spinal cord by cross-clamping the abdominal aorta for a period of 25 minutes. Spinal cord blood flow was measured before, during, and 15 minutes after cross-clamp removal. Animals were allowed to recover and were graded neurologically at 18 and 24 hours after ischemia. Flunarizine injection was associated with hypotension that was both transient and dose related. Animals pretreated with flunarizine 0.4 mg/kg had significantly improved neurological recovery scores at 18 hours after ischemia (P = .017) compared with vehicle controls. At 24 hours this effect was lessened (P = .095); however, 60% of flunarizine-treated animals retained their ability to hop, whereas all of the vehicle-treated animals were nonambulatory. Flunarizine has a protective effect on neurological recovery after experimental ischemic spinal cord injury. The therapeutic window is narrow, and dosing is limited by untoward hypotension. The mechanism of protection likely involves inhibition of pathological cytosolic calcium accumulation rather than a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle."

SSEPs were cortically recorded and CMEPs were transcortically produced using epidural ball and disc electrodes. SSEPs were elicited and CMEPs were recorded via hindlimb percutaneous needle electrodes. After control records, animals were subjected to a 50-g/cm impact to the dorsal cord surface using a modified weight drop technique. Evaluation of neurological injury was performed by SSEP and CMEP analysis and was compared with neurological assessments obtained before injury and 1 hour, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after injury. Neurohistopathological verification of each spinal cord lesion was performed at 6 weeks after injury. Animals subjected to a 50-g/cm cord impact showed no change in SSEP wave forms, but all components of the CMEP were greatly attenuated with this injury. Acutely, either very weak movement or no movement to noxious stimulation was present without vocalization. There was a spectrum of clinical recovery that correlated closely with the return and normalization of the amplitude of the CMEP in 100% of the animals tested. The eventual degree of clinical and CMEP improvement correlated well with the degree of histological damage present. The results of this study suggest that the CMEP is a reliable indicator of the initial degree of loss of neurological motor function in acute blunt spinal cord injury in the rat, as well as an accurate measure of the degree and extent of recovery. The rat model as outlined here is a simple and inexpensive system for evaluation both clinically and electrophysiologically of the degree of motor recovery from spinal cord injury. This model should prove useful in the evaluation of promising pharmacological agents for potential use in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury."

Case report. A 36-year-old woman presented with acute onset of paresis of the upper and lower extremity (level C5, ASIA B) the day after delivering a healthy daughter (39 weeks' gestation). Prior to giving birth, she was admitted with gestational hypertension. Directly postpartum, blood pressure increased markedly, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome was diagnosed. The next day, tetraplegia developed. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple epidural and subdural hematomas in the cervical and thoracic spinal canal extending from C2 to T8, with displacement and compression of the cord. Three weeks after treatment with intravenous labetalol, she made a significant recovery (level T1, ASIA D). This rare cause of spinal cord injury shows the importance of closely monitoring pregnant patients with hypertension complicated with HELLP syndrome both pre- and postpartum."

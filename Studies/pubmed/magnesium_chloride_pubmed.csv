Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that AC105 would lead to greater tissue sparing at the injury site and improved behavioral outcome when delivered in a clinically realistic time window post-injury. Four hours after contusion/compression injury, Yucatan minipigs were randomized to receive a 30-min intravenous infusion of AC105, magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), or saline. Animals received 4 additional infusions of the same dose at 6-h intervals. Behavioral recovery was tested for 12 weeks using two-dimensional (2D) kinematics during weight-supported treadmill walking and the Porcine Injury Behavior Scale (PTIBS), a 10-point locomotion scale. Spinal cords were evaluated ex vivo by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subjected to histological analysis. Treatment with AC105 or MgSO4 did not result in improvements in locomotor recovery on the PTIBS or in 2D kinematics on weight-supported treadmill walking. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed severe loss of tissue integrity at the impact site, with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity; this was not improved with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Histological analysis revealed no significant increase in gray or white matter sparing with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Finally, AC105 did not result in higher Mg2+ levels in CSF than with the use of standard MgSO4. In summary, when testing AC105 in a porcine model of SCI, we were unable to reproduce the promising therapeutic benefits observed previously in less-severe rodent models of SCI."

Riluzole and magnesium have been widely investigated as neuroprotective agents in animal models of spinal cord injury. As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we aimed to investigate if their neuroprotective efficacy could be cumulative. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of combined administration of riluzole and magnesium chloride in a contusive model of thoracic spinal cord injury. An in vivo experiment was set using female Wistar Han rats that underwent a thoracic spinal cord contusion (T8) using a weight drop method. An hour after injury, animals were randomly distributed to receive (1) saline, (2) riluzole (2.50 mg/kg), (3) magnesium chloride (24.18 mg/kg) in a polyethylene glycol formulation, or (4) a combined treatment (riluzole and magnesium). Subsequent treatments were given in four intraperitoneal injections (spaced 12 hours apart). The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, an activity box test, and a swimming test were used to evaluate behavioral recovery over a 4-week period. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords was performed to measure the extent and volume of the lesion, axonal preservation, serotonergic and glutamatergic fiber sparing, motor neuron survival, and inflammation. Our results show that only the riluzole treatment significantly improved behavioral recovery up to 4 weeks after injury when compared with saline controls (6.2±1.8), with animals achieving weight-supported stepping (9.1±1.2). Riluzole also promoted tissue sparing with significant differences achieved from 200 to 600 µm (caudally to the lesion epicenter), and reduced lesion volume, with animals presenting a significantly smaller lesion (3.23±0.26 mm(3)) when compared with the saline-treated group (4.74±0.80 mm(3)), representing a 32% decrease in lesion volume. Riluzole treatment induced significant axonal preservation, as well as serotonergic fiber sparing, caudally to the injury epicenter. Our results suggest that the combined treatment, although simultaneously targeting two excitotoxic-related mechanisms, did not further improve behavioral and histologic outcome when compared with riluzole given alone."

Here, we used intravenous injection of endothelial-binding lectin followed by histology to show that the number of perfused microvessels at the injury site is decreased by 80-90% as early as 20 min following a moderate T9 contusion in adult female rats. Hemorrhage within the spinal cord also was maximal at 20 min, consistent with its vasoconstrictive actions in the central nervous system (CNS). Microvascular blood flow recovered to up to 50% of normal volume in the injury penumbra by 6 h, but not at the epicenter. A comparison with an endothelial cell marker suggested that many microvessels fail to be reperfused up to 48 h post-injury. The ischemia was probably caused by vasospasm of vessels penetrating the parenchyma, because repeated Doppler measurements over the spinal cord showed a doubling of total blood flow over the first 12 h. Moreover, intravenous infusion of magnesium chloride, used clinically to treat CNS vasospasm, greatly improved the number of perfused microvessels at 24 and 48 h. The magnesium treatment seemed safe as it did not increase hemorrhage, despite the improved parenchymal blood flow. However, the treatment did not reduce acute microvessel, motor neuron or oligodendrocyte loss, and when infused for 7 days did not affect functional recovery or spared epicenter white matter over a 4 week period. These data suggest that microvascular blood flow can be restored with a clinically relevant treatment following spinal cord injury."

To provide physicians with an overview of the neurobiologic challenges of SCI, the current status of investigation for novel therapies that have been translated to human clinical trials, and the preclinical, scientific basis for each of these therapies. An abundance of recent scientific and clinical research activity has revealed numerous insights into the neurobiology of SCI, and has generated an abundance of potential therapies. An increasing number of such therapies are being translated into human SCI trials. Clinicians who attend to SCI patients are increasingly asked about potential treatments and clinical trials. Published data review of novel treatments that are either currently in human clinical trials for acute SCI or about to initiate clinical evaluation. A number of treatments have bridged the ""translational gap"" and are currently either in the midst of human SCI trials, or are about to begin such clinical evaluation. These include minocycline, Cethrin, anti-Nogo antibodies, systemic hypothermia, Riluzole, magnesium chloride in polyethylene glycol, and human embryonic stem cell derived oligodendrocyte progenitors. A systematic review of the preclinical literature on these specific therapies reveals promising results in a variety of different SCI injury models. The SCI community is encouraged by the progression of novel therapies from ""bench to bedside"" and the initiation of clinical trials for a number of different treatments. The task of clinical evaluation, however, is substantial, and many years will be required before the actual efficacy of the treatments currently in evaluation will be determined."

To investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of this magnesium in polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation in a contusive model of cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Intravenously administered magnesium has been extensively investigated as a neuroprotective agent in animal models of SCI, stroke, and traumatic brain injuries, and has been evaluated in large scale clinical trials for the latter 2 indications. We have developed a novel formulation of magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) within PEG, and have previously demonstrated the neuroprotective benefit of this formulation in animal models of thoracic SCI. Twenty-two Sprague Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical hemicontusion at C4-C5 and were randomized 2 hours later to either the MgCl₂ in PEG formulation, or normal saline. Each treatment was administered in 5 intravenous infusions spaced 6 hours apart. Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks, after which the cord was analyzed to measure the extent of gray matter and white matter sparing through the injury site. In the horizontal ladder test, the percentage of forelimb errors made by the animals treated with MgCl₂ in PEG formulation was significantly lower than the saline-treated controls. Histologic analysis also revealed a significantly higher cumulative white matter sparing through the injury site in the MgCl₂ in PEG group. MgCl₂ in a PEG formulation reduced secondary damage and improved behavioral recovery when administered 2 hours after a unilateral cervical hemicontusion injury. These findings are consistent with the neurologic benefit observed when administering this magnesium formulation in contusive and compressive models of thoracic SCI. Demonstrating the robustness of this neuroprotective effect in multiple injury models (and in the cervical injury model in particular) is important when considering the applicability of such a therapy for human SCIs."

Numerous investigators have reported the neuroprotective benefits of magnesium in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) as well, but typically with doses that far exceed human tolerability. To develop magnesium into a clinically relevant therapy for SCI, further refinement and improvement of the magnesium formulation is necessary. In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007). We established that the 254 micromol/kg dose of MgCl(2) was superior to 127 micromol/kg MgCl(2) with respect to tissue sparing and locomotor recovery. Additionally, the number of infusions (2, 4, or 6), time between infusions (6 vs 8 hours), and different magnesium salts (MgCl(2) vs MgSO(4)) were evaluated to determine an ""optimal"" treatment regimen. We observed that an ""optimized"" regimen of MgCl(2) within PEG conferred greater tissue neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery compared to methylprednisolone. Further a 4 hour time window of histologic and behavioral efficacy was established. The goal of these experiments was to help guide the treatment parameters for a clinical trial of magnesium within a polyethylene glycol formulation in acute human spinal cord injury."

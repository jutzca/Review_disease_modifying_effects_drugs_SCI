Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that AC105 would lead to greater tissue sparing at the injury site and improved behavioral outcome when delivered in a clinically realistic time window post-injury. Four hours after contusion/compression injury, Yucatan minipigs were randomized to receive a 30-min intravenous infusion of AC105, magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), or saline. Animals received 4 additional infusions of the same dose at 6-h intervals. Behavioral recovery was tested for 12 weeks using two-dimensional (2D) kinematics during weight-supported treadmill walking and the Porcine Injury Behavior Scale (PTIBS), a 10-point locomotion scale. Spinal cords were evaluated ex vivo by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subjected to histological analysis. Treatment with AC105 or MgSO4 did not result in improvements in locomotor recovery on the PTIBS or in 2D kinematics on weight-supported treadmill walking. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed severe loss of tissue integrity at the impact site, with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity; this was not improved with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Histological analysis revealed no significant increase in gray or white matter sparing with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Finally, AC105 did not result in higher Mg2+ levels in CSF than with the use of standard MgSO4. In summary, when testing AC105 in a porcine model of SCI, we were unable to reproduce the promising therapeutic benefits observed previously in less-severe rodent models of SCI."

Because of its controversial useful effects, the combination of MP and other pharmacological agents to enhance neuroprotective effects is desirable. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) has been shown to have neuroprotective and antihyperalgesic effects. In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of combining MP and MgSO4, on neuropathic pain and functional recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI) in male rats. A total of 48 adult male rats (weight 300-350 g) were used. After laminectomy, complete SCI was achieved by compression of the spinal cord for one minute with aneurysm clips. Single doses of Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), (600 mg/kg), Methylprednisolone (MP), (30 mg/kg) or combining MgSO4 and MP were injected intraperitoneally. Prior to surgery and during four weeks of study Tail flick latency (TFL) and BBB (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan) score and the acetone drop test were evaluated. In mean values of BBB score, a significant difference was observed in SCI+veh compared with other groups (P<0.05). Mean TFL also was significantly higher in SCI+veh compared with other groups (P<0.05). Mean acetone drop test score and weight were significantly different in MgSO4, MP and combining MgSO4 and MP  treated groups compared with SCI+veh group (P<0.05). These findings revealed that MP, MgSO4 and combining MgSO4 and MP treatment can attenuate neuropathic pains following SCI in rats include: thermal hyperalgesia and cold allodynia. They also can yield better improvement in motor function and decrease weight loss after SCI in rats compared with the control group."

Rats were injured by clip compression (50 g; T4) and treated 15 min and 6 hr postinjury intravenously (tail vein) with PEG (1 g/kg, 30% w/w in saline; n = 11), MgSO(4) (300 mg/kg; n = 5), PEG + MgSO(4) (n = 6), or saline (n = 10). Behavioral testing lasted for 6 weeks, followed by histological analysis of the spinal cord. Both PEG and MgSO(4) resulted in enhanced locomotor recovery and lower susceptibility to neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia) compared with saline. At 6 weeks, BBB scores were 7.3 +/- 0.2, 7.7 +/- 0.4, and 6.4 +/- 0.6 in PEG-treated, MgSO(4)-treated, and saline-treated control groups, respectively. Likewise, at 6 weeks PEG-, MgSO(4)-, and saline-treated control animals showed 3.5 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.9, and 5.0 +/- 0.5 avoidance responses to at-level touch, respectively. PEG + MgSO(4) improved locomotor recovery and reduced pain but did not provide additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. Neither treatment, nor their combination, attenuated mean arterial pressure (MAP) increases during autonomic dysreflexia. However, saline-treated controls had significantly lower resting MAP than PEG-treated rats and tended to have lower resting MAP than MgSO(4)-treated rats 6 weeks postinjury. MgSO(4) treatment and PEG + MgSO(4) treatment resulted in significant increases in dorsal myelin sparing, and the latter resulted in significant reductions in lesion volume, compared with saline-treated controls. Furthermore, mean lesion volumes correlated negatively with the corresponding mean BBB scores and positively with the corresponding mean pain scores. In conclusion, both PEG and MgSO(4) enhanced long-term clinical outcomes after SCI."

Hypothermia, thiopental, magnesium, lidocaine, and naloxone were used to pretreat the spinal cord prior to ischemia. Hypothermia and thiopental provided comparable protection: they each increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits in 50% of the animals from 26 to 41 minutes. They also increased from 10 to 30 minutes the time that the postsynaptic waves of the spinal somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) could be absent and the animal still have neurological recovery. Hypothermia and thiopental, when used together, increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits to 57 minutes in 50% of the animals. Naloxone increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits to 36 minutes in 50% of the animals, and increased to 20 minutes the time that the postsynaptic waves of the SSEP could be absent and the animal still have neurological recovery. Magnesium pretreatment improved neurological outcome, possibly by improving collateral circulation as the SSEP did not fail completely during aortic occlusion in all animals. Lidocaine was not beneficial, perhaps because of the prolonged hypotension that resulted."

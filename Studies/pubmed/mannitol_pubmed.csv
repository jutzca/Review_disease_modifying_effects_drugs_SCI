To investigate the effect of mannitol on Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP), postoperative neurological recovery and ultrastructural findings after an experimental SCI. The experimental microsurgery laboratory of a university hospital. A prospective, randomized animal study. Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into three groups (Groups I-III) for this study. Those in Group I were control animals who underwent laminectomy only, and non-traumatized spinal cord samples were obtained 2 weeks later. SCI was produced in Groups II and III using clip compression technique, and cord samples were obtained 2 weeks later. The rats in Group II received 2 g/kg of 20% mannitol intraperitoneally, immediately and three hours after trauma was induced; and those in Group III received the same amount of 0,9% NaCl in the same manner. Preoperative and postoperative SSEP records at the end of 2 weeks were obtained. Electron microscopy examination of the cord samples was done at 2 weeks postoperatively. Fischer's Exact Test. SSEP records, ultrastructural findings and clinical recovery showed that minor neural damage and significant recovery occurred in Group II. This study demonstrates that the administration of 2 g/kg of 20% mannitol produces significant improvement in the neural structures and protects the spinal cord following injury."

The correlation between the change in amplitude of the spinal cord evoked potential after injury and the prognosis for motor recovery of legs was also discussed. (Materials and Methods) The spinal cord of 57 adult dogs was traumatized by the weight dropping technique at the level of Th10. 37 dogs were not treated. The trauma consisted of 300 gm-cm impact injury, 400 gm-cm impact injury and 500 gm-cm impact injury. The motor function of the dogs was observed by clinical scale for rating hind limb motor function (modified Tarlov score) for one month after trauma. 20 dogs with 300 gm-cm contusion were treated with mannitol. 10 dogs were treated with intravenous continuous infusion of mannitol (1 g/kg/hr) 30 minutes after injury and 10 dogs with intravenous bolus injection of mannitol (2 g/kg) at 30 minutes and 3 hours after injury. The spinal cord evoked potential following direct stimulation of the spinal cord was recorded from the epidural space for 5 hours. The recording electrode was located cephalad to the site of the impact injury. (Results and Conclusion) 1. In each group, the amplitude of I potential decreased remarkably immediately after injury. Subsequently, gradual recovery was obtained. The spinal cord evoked potential following impact injury by the weight dropping technique could be estimated one hour after trauma in 300 gm-cm, 30 minutes after trauma in 400 gm-cm injury and immediately after trauma in 500 gm-cm injury. 2. Spinal cord evoked potential was useful in monitoring the recovery potential of the spinal cord. Recovery of amplitude more than 40% indicated a favorable prognosis. On the other hand, recovery of amplitude less than 19% showed a poor prognosis. However, the precise prognosis for motor recovery could not be accurately estimated in dogs with recovery of amplitude between 39% and 20%. 3. In mannitol-treated group with intravenous continuous infusion, the recovery of the amplitude was superior to that in untreated group at a significance level of p less than 0.05. However, in the group with intravenous bolus injection of mannitol, the recovery was transient."

Their clinical data suggested that operative treatment, in fact, worsened the condition. Recent experience with this clinical entity, however, indicates that in selected patients operative intervention may be of value in improving the rate and degree of motor recovery. A retrospective study of all individuals admitted to our hospital (Delaware Valley Spinal Cord Injury Center) with central cervical spinal cord injury was done (28 patients). One-half had been treated with medical therapy alone (Group I); the others were treated both medically and surgically (Group II). Medical therapy consisted of intravenous mannitol, dexamethasone, and sodium bicarbonate given during the acute phase of the injury. Both groups were immobilized using either a halo or a Philadelphia collar. Criteria for entry into the surgical group were one or both of the following: (a) failure to improve progressively after an initial period of improvement, with persistent compression of neural tissue visualized on myelography and (b) unacceptable instability of the spinal bony elements. The patients were given neurological scores based on the motor power of the major muscle groups. The stability of the spine was scored using the Panjabi-White scale. The two groups were compared using Student's t-test and the two-factor analysis of variance. There was no significant difference in initial neurological scores between the groups. The surgical groups had a higher incidence of instability of the bony elements of the cervical spine, as judged by the Panjabi-White scale.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Multifactorial targeted therapy is a promising strategy for SCI. The anti-inflammatory peptide KAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA (KAFAK) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-modified hyaluronan-methylcellulose (HAMC) hydrogel was designed for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal protein delivery. The physical and biological characteristics of HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel were measured in vitro. SCI model was performed in rats and HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel was injected into the injured site of spinal cord. The neuronal regeneration effect was evaluated by inflammatory cytokine levels, behavioral test and histological analysis at 8 weeks post operation. HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel showed minimally swelling property and sustained release of the KAFAK and BDNF. HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel significantly improved the proliferation of PC12 cells in vitro without cytotoxicity. Significant recovery in both neurological function and nerve tissue morphology in SCI rats were observed in HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF group. HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF group showed significant reduction in proinflammatory cytokines expression and cystic cavitation, decreased glial scar formation, and improved neuronal survival in the rat SCI model compared to HAMC group and SCI group. The HAMC-KAFAK/BDNF hydrogel promotes functional recovery of rats with spinal cord injury by regulating inflammatory cytokine levels and improving axonal regeneration."

Timely delivery of specialized care has reduced mortality; however, long-term neurological recovery continues to be limited. In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority. Collaborative international efforts have led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for traumatic SCI based on robust evaluation of current evidence. The current article provides an in-depth review of progress in SCI, covering the above areas."

Previously, we reported on the therapeutic potential of a neural progenitor cell (NPC) and chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) combinatorial therapy for chronic SCI. However, the source of NPCs and delivery system required for ChABC remained barriers to clinical application. Here, we investigated directly reprogrammed human NPCs biased toward an oligodendrogenic fate (oNPCs) in combination with sustained delivery of ChABC using an innovative affinity release strategy in a crosslinked methylcellulose biomaterial for the treatment of chronic SCI in an immunodeficient rat model. This combinatorial therapy increased long-term survival of oNPCs around the lesion epicenter, facilitated greater oligodendrocyte differentiation, remyelination of the spared axons by engrafted oNPCs, enhanced synaptic connectivity with anterior horn cells and neurobehavioral recovery. This combinatorial therapy is a promising strategy to regenerate the chronically injured spinal cord."

Due to the complex nature of SCI pathology, a combination treatment strategy will likely be required for success. We hypothesized that tissue and functional repair would be achieved in a rat model of impact-compression SCI by combining degradation of the glial scar, using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), with recruitment of endogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs), using stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF). To test this hypothesis, we designed a crosslinked methylcellulose hydrogel (XMC) for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal drug delivery. ChABC was released from XMC using protein-peptide affinity interactions while SDF was delivered by electrostatic affinity interactions from polymeric nanoparticles embedded in XMC. Rats with SCI were treated acutely with a combination of SDF and ChABC, SDF alone, ChABC alone, or vehicle alone, and compared to injury only. Treatment with ChABC, both alone and in combination with SDF, resulted in faster and more sustained behavioural improvement over time than other groups. The significantly reduced chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan levels and greater distribution of NPCs throughout the spinal cord tissue with ChABC delivery, both alone and in combination with SDF, may explain the improved locomotor function. Treatment with SDF alone had no apparent effect on NPC number or distribution nor synergistic effect with ChABC delivery. Thus, in this model of SCI, tissue and functional repair is attributed to ChABC."

Stem cell therapy is a promising approach for spinal cord injury (SCI); however, this strategy is currently limited by the poor survival and uncontrolled differentiation of transplanted stem cells. In an attempt to achieve greater survival and integration with the host tissue, we examined the survival and efficacy of adult brain-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) injected within a hydrogel blend of hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) into a subacute, clinically relevant model of rat SCI. Prior to use, HAMC was covalently modified with recombinant rat platelet-derived growth factor-A (rPDGF-A) to promote oligodendrocytic differentiation. SCI rats transplanted with NSPCs in HAMC-rPDGF-A showed improved behavioral recovery compared to rats transplanted with NSPCs in media. Rats with NSPC/HAMC-rPDGF-A transplants had a significant reduction in cavitation, improved graft survival, increased oligodendrocytic differentiation, and sparing of perilesional host oligodendrocytes and neurons. These data suggest that HAMC-rPDGF-A is a promising vehicle for cell delivery to the injured spinal cord."

To achieve this sustained release, anti-NogoA is typically delivered by osmotic minipumps; however, external minipumps are susceptible to infection. To address this issue, we developed a drug delivery system that consists of anti-NogoA-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles dispersed in a hydrogel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (composite HAMC). To optimize in vitro release, we screened formulations for improved anti-NogoA bioactivity and sustained release based on combinations of co-encapsulated trehalose, hyaluronan, MgCO(3), and CaCO(3). Co-encapsulated MgCO(3) and CaCO(3) slowed the rate of anti-NogoA release and did not influence anti-NogoA bioactivity. Co-encapsulated trehalose significantly improved anti-NogoA bioactivity at early release time points by stabilizing the protein during lyophilization. Co-encapsulated trehalose with hyaluronan improved bioactivity up to 28d and dramatically increased the rate and duration of sustained delivery. The sustained release of bioactive anti-NogoA from composite HAMC is a compelling formulation for in vivo evaluation in a model of spinal cord injury."

Our goal was to improve the number and type of regenerated axons within the spinal cord through the addition of different matrices and growth factors incorporated within the lumen of the channel. After complete spinal cord transection at T8, pHEMA-MMA channels, having an elastic modulus of 263+/-13 kPa were implanted into adult Sprague Dawley rats. The channels were then filled with one of the following matrices: collagen, fibrin, Matrigel, methylcellulose, or smaller pHEMA-MMA tubes placed within a larger pHEMA-MMA channel (called tubes within channels, TWC). We also supplemented selected matrices (collagen and fibrin) with neurotrophic factors, fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). After channel implantation, fibrin glue was applied to the cord-channel interface, and a duraplasty was performed with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane. Controls included animals that had either complete spinal cord transection and implantation of unfilled pHEMA-MMA channels or complete spinal cord transection. Regeneration was assessed by retrograde axonal tracing with Fluoro-Gold, and immunohistochemistry with NF-200 (for total axon counts) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP, for sensory axon counts) after 8 weeks survival. Fibrin, Matrigel, methylcellulose, collagen with FGF-1, collagen with NT-3, fibrin with FGF-1, and fibrin with NT-3 increased the total axon density within the channel (ANOVA, p<0.05) compared to unfilled channel controls. Only fibrin with FGF-1 decreased the sensory axon density compared to unfilled channel controls (ANOVA, p<0.05). Fibrin promoted the greatest axonal regeneration from reticular neurons, and methylcellulose promoted the greatest regeneration from vestibular and red nucleus neurons. With Matrigel, there was no axonal regeneration from brainstem motor neurons. The addition of FGF-1 increased the axonal regeneration of vestibular neurons, and the addition of NT-3 decreased the total number of axons regenerating from brainstem neurons. The fibrin and TWC showed a consistent improvement in locomotor function at both 7 and 8 weeks. Thus, the present study shows that the presence and type of matrix contained within synthetic hydrogel guidance channels affects the quantity and origin of axons that regenerate after complete spinal cord transection, and can improve functional recovery. Determining the optimum matrices and growth factors for insertion into these guidance channels will improve regeneration of the injured spinal cord."

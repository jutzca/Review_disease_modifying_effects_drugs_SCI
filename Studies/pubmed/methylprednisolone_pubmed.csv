We studied the effect of locally applied self-assembling micellar formulation of methylprednisolone succinate (MPS) with trifunctional block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (TBC) on functional recovery and tissue drug content after SCI in rats in comparison with local and systemic administration of MPS alone. Variations in the amplitude of motor evoked responses in the hindlimb muscles induced by epidural stimulation during acute phase of SCI and restoration of movements during chronic period after local vs. systemic application of MPS were evaluated in this study. Results demonstrate that local delivery of MPS in combination with TBC facilitates spinal cord sensorimotor circuitry, increasing the excitability. In addition, this formulation was found to be more effective in improvement of locomotion after SCI compared to systemic administration. LC-MS/MS data shows that the use of TBC carrier increases the glucocorticoid content in treated spinal cord by more than four times over other modes of treatment. The results of this study demonstrate that the local treatment of acute SCI with MPS in the form of mixed micelles with TBC can provide improved therapeutic outcome by promoting drug accumulation and functional restoration of the spinal cord."

We aimed to objectively evaluate the effect of timing of decompressive surgery for acute SCI on long-term neurological outcomes. We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data derived from four independent, prospective, multicentre data sources, including data from December, 1991, to March, 2017. Three of these studies had been published; of these, only one study previously specifically analysed the effect of the timing of surgical decompression. These four datasets were selected because they were among the highest quality acute SCI datasets available and contained highly granular data. Individual patient data were obtained by request from study authors. All patients who underwent decompressive surgery for acute SCI within these datasets were included. Patients were stratified into early (<24 h after spinal injury) and late (≥24 h after spinal injury) decompression groups. Neurological outcomes were assessed by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), or International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), examination. The primary endpoint was change in total motor score from baseline to 1 year after spinal injury. Secondary endpoints were ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade and change in upper-extremity motor, lower-extremity motor, light touch, and pin prick scores after 1 year. One-stage meta-analyses were done by hierarchical mixed-effects regression adjusting for baseline score, age, mechanism of injury, AIS grade, level of injury, and administration of methylprednisolone. Effect sizes were summarised by mean difference (MD) for sensorimotor scores and common odds ratio (cOR) for AIS grade, with corresponding 95% CIs. As a secondary analysis, change in total motor score was regressed against time to surgical decompression (h) as a continuous variable, using a restricted cubic spline with adjustment for the same covariates as in the primary analysis. We identified 1548 eligible patients from the four datasets. Outcome data at 1 year after spinal injury were available for 1031 patients (66·6%). Patients who underwent early surgical decompression (n=528) experienced greater recovery than patients who had late decompression surgery (n=1020) at 1 year after spinal injury; total motor scores improved by 23·7 points (95% CI 19·2-28·2) in the early surgery group versus 19·7 points (15·3-24·0) in the late surgery group (MD 4·0 points [1·7-6·3]; p=0·0006), light touch scores improved by 19·0 points (15·1-23·0) vs 14·8 points (11·2-18·4; MD 4·3 [1·6-7·0]; p=0·0021), and pin prick scores improved by 18·3 points (13·7-22·9) versus 14·2 points (9·8-18·6; MD 4·0 [1·5-6·6]; p=0·0020). Patients who had early decompression also had better AIS grades at 1 year after surgery, indicating less severe impairment, compared with patients who had late surgery (cOR 1·48 [95% CI 1·16-1·89]; p=0·0019). When time to surgical decompression was modelled as a continuous variable, there was a steep decline in change in total motor score with increasing time during the first 24-36 h after injury (p<0·0001); and after 36 h, change in total motor score plateaued. Surgical decompression within 24 h of acute SCI is associated with improved sensorimotor recovery. The first 24-36 h after injury appears to represent a crucial time window to achieve optimal neurological recovery with decompressive surgery following acute SCI. None."

To date, systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) have shown promise in SCI. However, systemic immunosuppression can have detrimental side effects. Therefore, immunomodulatory approaches including the use of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) could represent an attractive alternative. While emerging preclinical data suggests that hIgG is neuroprotective after SCI, the optimal time window of administration and the mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. These knowledge gaps were the focus of this research study. Female adult Wistar rats received a clip compression-contusion SCI at the C7/T1 level of the spinal cord. Injured rats were randomized, in a blinded manner, to receive a single intravenous bolus of hIgG (2 g/kg) or control buffer at 15 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) or 4 h post-SCI. At 24 h and 8 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological and neurobehavioral analyses were undertaken. At all 3 administration time points, hIgG (2 g/kg) resulted in significantly better short-term and long-term outcomes as compared to control buffer. No significant differences were observed when comparing outcomes between the different time points of administration. At 24 h post-injury, hIgG (2 g/kg) administration enhanced the integrity of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) by increasing expression of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in BSCB integrity were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, lower amounts of albumin and Evans Blue in the injured spinal cord and greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. After hIgG (2 g/kg) treatment, there were more neutrophils in the spleen and fewer neutrophils in the blood. hIgG also co-localized with endothelial cell ligands that mediate neutrophil extravasation into the injured spinal cord. Importantly, short-term effects of delayed hIgG (2 g/kg) administration were associated with enhanced tissue and neuron preservation, as well as neurobehavioral and sensory recovery at 8 weeks post-SCI. hIgG (2 g/kg) shows promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by hIgG (2 g/kg) in the injured spinal cord might be explained in twofold. First, hIgG might antagonize neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord by co-localizing with endothelial cell ligands that mediate various steps in neutrophil extravasation. Second, hIgG could traffic neutrophils towards the spleen by increasing expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. Overall, we demonstrate that delayed administration of hIgG (2 g/kg) at 1 and 4-h post-injury enhances short-term and long-term benefits after SCI by modulating local and systemic neuroinflammatory cascades."

SCI is a serious traumatic disease of the central nervous system. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays important roles in SCI. Metformin has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. Whether metformin could improve SCI through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway remains unclear. Rats were divided into sham group, SCI group, SCI + metformin group, metformin + XAV939 group (XAV939 is an effective inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway), and methylprednisolone group. BBB scores were used to detect motor function recovery at different time points (0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) in SCI rats. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, TUNEL, HE and Nissl staining were used to observe the morphological characteristics of spinal cord tissue and the expression of inflammation and apoptosis in spinal cord neurons. Metformin(50 mg/kg) promoted motor functional recovery in rats after SCI, increased the expressions of β-catenin and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inhibited neuron apoptosis and inflammatory response, and improved the recovery of pathological morphology at the injury site by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We found a possible mechanism that metformin could reduce inflammation and apoptosis, and promote functional recovery of SCI rats through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway."

Following SCI pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase at the lesion site and play important roles in secondary tissue damage. Methylprednisolone (MP) is a glucocorticoid, and minocycline is a tetracycline-derived antibiotic both with neuroprotective effects on central nervous system trauma. However, there are limited studies on their effects on SCI. In this study, we aimed to evaluate effects of MP+minocycline combined treatment on cellular distribution and localization of TNF-α And IL-6 after SCI. Eighty Wistar rats were divided into three main groups as the intact control group, sham operation group, and experimental control group that received spinal cord compression injury. Following the injury, the experimental control group was subdivided into four groups as control, methylprednisolone treatment, minocycline treatment and, MP+minocycline combined treatment groups. Tissue samples were obtained from all groups at 24 hours and 72 hours after the injury. We found a significant decrease in TNF-α And IL-6 expressions in combined treatment group at 24 hours after injury. Also, there was a significant decrease in MDA and increase in SOD levels in this group. Furthermore, decreased lipid peroxidation and neuronal and glial cell death were also observed in combined treatment group. These results suggest that MP+minocycline combined treatment promotes functional recovery and, it should be considered as an effective treatment protocol following SCI."

Group C also received methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) after 3 h of injury. The control group (group A) did not receive corticoids or stem cells. Voiding and motor performance evaluations were performed daily for 90 days post-transplantation. Cells were labeled with PKH26 or PKH67 for in vitro monitoring. For in vivo screening, the cells were evaluated for bioluminescence. The levels of some cytokines were quantified in different times. Euthanasia was performed 90 days post-transplant. β-tubulin III expression was evaluated in the spinal cord of the animals from all groups. As a result, we observed a recovery of 66.6 % and 61.9 % in urinary continence of animals from groups B and C, respectively. Partial recovery of motor was observed in 23.8 % and 19 % of the animals from groups B and C, respectively. Cells remained viable at the site up to 90 days after transplantation. No significant difference was observed in levels of cytokines and thickness of urinary bladders between groups. A smaller percentage of tissue injury and higher concentrations of neuropils were observed in the spinal cords of the animals from groups B and C than control group. Thus, hADSCs transplantation with or without MPSS, contributed to the improvement in voiding and motor performance of Wistar rats submitted to compressive spinal cord injury."

The vast majority of treatments aim to prevent or at least stop the progression of secondary neurotoxic events during the acute period. Ozone has been found to have potent antiinflammatory effects, to activate the immune system, and to have a substantial impact on the antioxidant system. In this study the authors aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of ozone and their possible roles in recovery from spine injury, assessed based on biochemical, histological, and neurological parameters using an experimental spine injury model in rats. The study included 31 female Wistar albino rats. The rats were divided randomly into 5 groups, with 7 rats in each group except the sham group, which contained 3 rats, as follows: group 1 (sham), laminectomy; group 2 (control), laminectomy and spinal trauma with no medical treatment (0.5 ml isotonic saline applied 1 hour postsurgery); group 3, single medical treatment with 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone applied intraperitoneally 1 hour after laminectomy and trauma; group 4, single medical treatment with 60 μg/ml ozone at 0.7 mg/kg applied intraperitoneally 1 hour after laminectomy and trauma; and group 5, double medical treatment with 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone and 60 μg/ml ozone at 0.7 mg/kg applied intraperitoneally 1 hour after laminectomy and trauma. After neurosurgery, neurobehavioral tests were performed in all groups. After 7 days of follow-up, all the rats were killed. Biopsy specimens obtained from trauma sites were examined using H & E, cresyl violet, immunohistochemical (anticonnexin-43), and TUNEL staining processes. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were measured in blood samples. The level of neurobehavioral healing was the highest in the double-treatment group (group 5), and the difference between the groups was significant. The minimum IL-6 level was found in group 5, indicating that the antiinflammatory impact was the most significant in this group (p = 0.01). Additionally, ozone was found to reduce oxidant stress more effectively than methylprednisolone (p = 0.03). Although methylprednisolone was superior to ozone in terms of the antiinflammatory effect, this effect was greater in group 5. Nevertheless, the number of neurons in group 5 was close to that of the control group, and the number of apoptotic cells was the least in group 5 (p < 0.001). In acute spinal injury, the combined application of methylprednisolone and ozone was found to have a greater antiinflammatory effect, hasten clinical recovery, and increase histological recovery compared with methylprednisolone therapy alone. This study showed that this combination therapy of methylprednisolone with the addition of ozone might have a more beneficial effect in the treatment of spinal injury than methylprednisolone therapy alone."

The injured spinal tissues were collected for assessing C‑X3‑C motif chemokine ligand 1(CX3CL1)/C‑X3‑C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) expression at each time point via western blotting (WB) and quantitative PCR. The cellular localization of the proteins was detected by immunofluorescence. Another batch of rats (subdivided into sham, injury model, AZD8797 and methylprednisolone groups) were used to evaluate locomotive recovery with a Basso Beattie Bresnahan score. Based on the expression level of CX3CR1, these rats were sacrificed at the most prominent stage of CX3CR1 expression (10 days after SCI), for assessing the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α/interleukin (IL)‑6/IL‑1β and the expression of CX3CL1/CX3CR1/caspase 3/Bcl‑2/Bax in the spinal cord tissues through WB and ELISA. Additionally, apoptosis and necrosis in the injured spinal cord were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‑-mediated dUTP nick‑end labeling staining/fluoro‑jade B staining. Expression levels of both CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 reached their peak 10 days after the injury, followed by a dramatic downward trend at 14 days. The enhanced expression of CX3CR1 was detected in astrocytes and microglia of the injured spinal cord. AZD8797 improved locomotive recovery after 10 days of SCI and was as effective as methylprednisolone. The effect of AZD8797 was mediated by suppressing apoptosis, necrosis and inflammatory responses, as assessed by WB/ELISA and morphological examinations. The current study has demonstrated that AZD8797 can effectively block overwhelming inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis after SCI and facilitate early recovery of locomotive function."

Spinal cord contusion injury was induced in adult male rats at thoracic level T9/T10 using the Infinite Horizon impactor. One hour after lesion the animals were treated with a sub-occipital injection of human bmSC into the cisterna magna. No immune suppression was used. One dose of bmSC consisted, on average, of 2.3 million non-manipulated cells in 100 μL suspension, which was processed out of fresh human bone marrow from the iliac crest of healthy volunteers. Treatment efficacy was compared with intraperitoneal injections of methylprednisolone (MP) and saline. The recovery of motor functions was assessed during a surveillance period of nine weeks. Adverse events as well as general health, weight and urodynamic functions were monitored daily. After this time, the animals were perfused, and the spinal cord tissue was investigated histologically. Rats treated with bmSC did not reject the human implants and showed no sign of sickness behavior or neuropathic pain. Compared to MP treatment, animals displayed better recovery of their SCI-induced motor deficits. There were no significant differences in the recovery of bladder control between groups. Histological analysis at ten weeks after SCI revealed no differences in tissue sparing and astrogliosis, however, bmSC treatment was accompanied with reduced axonal degeneration in the dorsal ascending fiber tracts, lower Iba1-immunoreactivity (IR) close to the lesion site and reduced apoptosis in the ventral grey matter. Neuroinflammation, as evidenced by CD68-IR, was significantly reduced in the MP-treated group. Human bmSC that were prepared by negative selection without expansion in culture have neuroprotective properties after SCI. Given the effect size on motor function, implantation in the acute phase was not sufficient to induce spinal cord repair. Due to their immune modulatory properties, allogeneic implants of bmSC can be used in combinatorial therapies of SCI."

The rat SCI model was prepared using the modified Allen's method with the animals randomly divided into the following 4 groups (n=10 for each group): SCI; methylprednisolone (300 mg/kg); high-frequency electrotherapy; and combination treatment with electrotherapy combined with methylprednisolone (300 mg/kg). The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score, somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) were used to assess spinal function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NF-κB expression levels were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-2 expression levels were determined by ELISA, and caspase 3 activity was also assessed. In all treatment groups, BDNF mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased, whilst those of NF-κB were reduced. Additionally, an elevated BBB score, improved SEPs and MEPs, inhibited caspase 3 activity and downregulated TNF-α and IL-2 expression levels were observed, compared with the SCI group (P<0.05). However, the combination group exhibited more significant effects on SCI. In conclusion, methylprednisolone combined with high frequency electrotherapy may improve the symptoms of SCI by increasing the expression level of BDNF, reducing that of NF-κB, and suppressing the secretion of inflammatory factors."

Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations."

We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library (to May 22, 2018) for studies comparing neurologic recoveries, adverse events, and in-hospital costs between ASCI patients who underwent high-dose MP treatment or not. Data were synthesized with corresponding statistical models according to the degree of heterogeneity. We enrolled 16 studies (1,863 participants) including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 13 observational studies. Pooled results indicated that MP was not associated with an increase in motor score improvement (RCTs: p = 0.84; observational studies: p = 0.44) and incidence of recovery by at least one grade on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale or Frankel (p = 0.53). Meanwhile, MP did not lead to better sensory recovery (p = 0.07). However, MP was associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and respiratory tract infection (p = 0.01). The difference in the overall in-hospital costs between MP and control groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.78). Based on the current evidence, high-dose MP treatment, in comparison to controls, does not contribute to better neurologic recoveries but may increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ASCI. Therefore, we recommend against routine use of high-dose MP early after ASCI."

The blood-spinal cord barrier consists of pericytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, which are collectively termed the neurovascular unit. These cells support spinal cord homeostasis by expressing tight junction proteins. Physical trauma to the spinal cord disrupts the barrier, which leads to neuroinflammation by facilitating immune cell migration to the damaged site in a process involving immune cell adhesion. Immunosuppressive strategies, including methylprednisolone (MPSS), have been investigated to treat SCI. However, despite some success, MPSS has the potential to increase a patient's susceptibility to wound infection and impaired wound healing. Hence, immunomodulation may be a more attractive approach than immunosuppression. Approved for modulating neuroinflammation in certain disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) has shown promise in the setting of experimental SCI, though the optimal dose and mechanism of action remain undetermined. Female adult Wistar rats were subjected to moderate-severe clip compression injury (35 g) at the C7-T1 level and randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV) bolus of hIgG (0.02, 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2 g/kg), MPSS (0.03 g/kg), or control buffer at 15 min post-SCI. At 24 h and 6 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological, and neurobehavioral effects of hIgG were analyzed. At 24 h post-injury, human immunoglobulin G co-localized with spinal cord pericytes, astrocytes, and vessels. hIgG (2 g/kg) protected the spinal cord neurovasculature after SCI by increasing tight junction protein expression and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in vascular integrity were associated with changes in spinal cord inflammation. Interestingly, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased serum expression of inflammatory cytokines and co-localized (without decreasing protein expression) with spinal cord vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a protein used by immune cells to enter into inflamed tissue. Acute molecular benefits of hIgG (2 g/kg) led to greater tissue preservation, functional blood flow, and neurobehavioral recovery at 6 weeks post-SCI. Importantly, the effects of hIgG (2 g/kg) were superior to control buffer and hIgG (0.4 g/kg), and comparable with MPSS (0.03 g/kg). hIgG (2 g/kg) is a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate secondary pathology in SCI through antagonizing immune cell infiltration at the level of the neurovascular unit."

In this study, i.v. administered poly(lactide-coglycolide) nanoparticles were internalized by circulating monocytes and neutrophils, reprogramming these cells based on their physicochemical properties and not by an active pharmaceutical ingredient, to exhibit altered biodistribution, gene expression, and function. Approximately 80% of nanoparticle-positive immune cells were observed within the injury, and, additionally, the overall accumulation of innate immune cells at the injury was reduced 4-fold, coinciding with down-regulated expression of proinflammatory factors and increased expression of antiinflammatory and proregenerative genes. Furthermore, nanoparticle administration induced macrophage polarization toward proregenerative phenotypes at the injury and markedly reduced both fibrotic and gliotic scarring 3-fold. Moreover, nanoparticle administration with the implanted multichannel bridge led to increased numbers of regenerating axons, increased myelination with about 40% of axons myelinated, and an enhanced locomotor function (score of 6 versus 3 for control group). These data demonstrate that nanoparticles provide a platform that limits acute inflammation and tissue destruction, at a favorable risk-benefit ratio, leading to a proregenerative microenvironment that supports regeneration and functional recovery. These particles may have applications to trauma and potentially other inflammatory diseases."

Therefore, the development of alternative therapeutic agents for the treatment of SCI is of great clinical significance. In the present study, an acute SCI rat model was induced and, following a modified Allen method, the function of pectolinarigenin (PG) in SCI was investigated. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=6 in each group); a sham surgery group and an SCI + saline group were used as negative controls and an SCI + MP (30 mg/kg) group was used as a positive control. The remaining animals were subdivided into three groups: SCI + PG (10 mg/kg); SCI + PG (30 mg/kg); and SCI + PG (50 mg/kg). Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor rating scoring was performed to assess functional recovery. Nissl staining and TUNEL staining were used to evaluated neuronal lesion volume and apoptosis, respectively. The results demonstrated that PG significantly improved functional recovery and reduced tissue loss, and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, a western blotting assay was conducted to measure the expression of genes associated with apoptosis. The data suggested that PG downregulated the activated caspase-3, caspase-9 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase expression and reduced the Bax: Bcl2 ratio. The findings of the present study suggested that PG may exert a protective effect against SCI in rats, potentially by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and PG may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic agent against SCI."

Albumin-based nanoparticles, which can encapsulate therapeutic drugs and release cargo in a controlled pattern, show high biocompatibility and low toxicity. The Nogo protein, expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes, can inhibit axonal growth by binding with the axonal Nogo receptor (NgR). Peptide NEP1-40, an NgR antagonist, can bind specifically to Nogo, significantly improving functional recovery and axon growth in the corticospinal tract. Therefore, we hypothesized that delivering MP within nanoparticles decorated with NEP1-40 could avoid the disadvantages of free MP and enhance its therapeutic efficacy against SCI. We used human serum albumin to prepare MP-loaded NPs (MP-NPs), to whose surface we conjugated NEP1-40 to form NEP1-40-MP-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated successful formation of nanoparticles. NEP1-40-MP-NPs were taken up significantly better than MP-NPs by the Nogo-positive cell line RSC-96 and were associated with significantly higher Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores in rats recovering from SCI. Micro-computed tomography assay showed that NEP1-40-MP-NPs mitigated SCI-associated loss of bone mineral density and accelerated spinal cord repair. NEP1-40-MP-NPs can enhance the therapeutic effects of MP against SCI. This novel platform may also be useful for delivering other types of drugs."

Immunofluorescence and western blot assays were performed to measure immunoreactivity and expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neuronal marker neurofilament protein, microglial marker CD11b and astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein in the injured spinal cord. Huangqin flavonoid extraction markedly reduced spinal cord hematoma, inflammatory cell infiltration and cavities and scars, and increased the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale scores; these effects were identical to those of methylprednisolone. Huangqin flavonoid extraction also increased immunoreactivity and expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurofilament protein, and reduced immunoreactivity and expression levels of CD11b and glial fibrillary acidic protein, in the injured spinal cord.

Aim of the Study: This study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of methylprednisolone and levetiracetam on SCI. Materials and Methods: In this study, 42 male Wistar Albino rats, each weighing 300-350 g, were separated into three main groups: control group, acute and subacute stage groups. With the exception of the control group, a T7-8 dorsal laminectomy was performed on the spinal column of the rats.

The damaged spinal cord was removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. Results: Both pharmacological agents were determined to have improved the histopathological architecture in damaged neural tissues during the acute period of SCI, but could not sustain this activity in the subacute period. Neither pharmacological agent affected the biochemical data in the acute nor subacute stages. Conclusions: Both pharmacological agents showed histopathological healing effects in injured tissues during the acute phase of SCI in this rat model but these effects could not be sustained in the subacute period. No effect on biochemical data was seen in either the acute or subacute period. There is a need for further advanced studies to determine the effects of levetiracetam on the healing processes in SCI."

The current treatment for moderate to severe DCM consists of surgical decompression, which, while effective in most cases, can result in neuroinflammation and spinal cord reperfusion injury, leading to perioperative neurological complications and suboptimal neurological recovery. The primary objective of this study was to assess, in a translationally relevant animal model of DCM, the efficacy of perioperative methylprednisolone (MP) in enhancing neurological recovery and to evaluate its effect on the inflammatory response following decompression. DCM was induced in C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, an aromatic polyether material was implanted underneath the C5-C6 laminae to cause progressive compression of the cervical spinal cord due to focal ossification. Decompressive surgery was undertaken at 12 weeks post initial biomaterial implantation. Animals received one dose of MP (30 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min before decompression and at 2 weeks after decompression. Acute analysis of secreted cytokines and spinal cord microvasculature was complemented with immunohistochemistry for glial and neuronal cell markers. Locomotor outcomes were measured using the CatWalk system. The composition of circulating white blood cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. A single dose of MP before decompression significantly sped locomotor recovery (*p < 0.05) and reduced the incidence of perioperative motor complications, without affecting the composition of circulating white blood cells. Histological assessment of the spinal cord showed significant neuronal preservation and a modest reduction in parenchymal inflammation. Our data suggest that MP reduces perioperative neurological complications following decompressive surgery for DCM by protecting neurons from inflammation, without compromising the composition of circulating immune cells. We propose that MP, which is commonly used for neurological disorders including spinal cord injury, be considered as a perioperative adjunct to decompressive surgery to attenuate neurological complications."

In this study, Governor Vessel electroacupuncture combined with decompression at different time points was used to treat acute spinal cord injury. The rat models were established by inserting a balloon catheter into the atlanto-occipital space. The upper cervical spinal cord was compressed for 12 or 48 hours prior to decompression. Electroacupuncture was conducted at the acupoints Dazhui (GV14) and Baihui (GV 20) (2 Hz, 15 minutes) once a day for 14 consecutive days. Compared with decompression alone, hind limb motor function recovery was superior after decompression for 12 and 48 hours combined with electroacupuncture. However, the recovery of motor function was not significantly different at 14 days after treatment in rats receiving decompression for 12 hours. Platelet-activating factor levels and caspase-9 protein expression were significantly reduced in rats receiving electroacupuncture compared with decompression alone. These findings indicate that compared with decompression alone, Governor Vessel electroacupuncture combined with delayed decompression (48 hours) is more effective in the treatment of upper cervical spinal cord injury. Governor Vessel electroacupuncture combined with early decompression (12 hours) can accelerate the recovery of nerve movement in rats with upper cervical spinal cord injury. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to confirm whether it is possible to obtain additional benefit compared with early decompression alone."

In this study, clinical progressions of 11 patients diagnosed with SCIWORA were analyzed, and terminologic differences were discussed. The clinical findings of 11 adults with a diagnosis of SCIWORA at the time of diagnosis and in the long term were analyzed according to the ASIA classification scheme. The presence of a correlation between radiological findings from the early and late periods and the clinical findings was investigated. High-dose methylprednisolone treatment was administered to all newly diagnosed patients in the early period, and the clinical response was observed. Clinical, prognostic, and radiological comparisons with SCIWORA cases reported in the literature were conducted. Seven patients received a diagnosis of cervical SCIWORA, and 4 patients had thoracal SCIWORA. Neurologic findings at the time of diagnosis and in the early and late periods vary independent of radiological findings. In the cases where significant neurologic recovery was not observed within the first 3 days, significant recovery also was not seen in the later period. In the cases where neurologic recovery was seen, improvements in sphincter function and sensory and motor deficits were observed. In patients diagnosed with SCIWORA, early neurologic response is the determining factor for prognosis. Clinical findings and prognosis demonstrate no correlation with radiological findings."

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an endogenous protein which regulates cell proliferation, growth and differention. Previous studies reported that EGF exerts neuroprotective effect in spinal cord after SCI. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EGF-mediated protection in different regions of nervous system have not shown yet. In this study, we aimed to examine possible anti-apoptotic and protective roles of EGF not only in spinal cord but also in brain following SCI. Twenty-eight adult rats were divided into four groups of seven animals each as follows: sham, trauma (SCI), SCI + EGF and SCI + methylprednisolone (MP) groups. The functional neurological deficits due to the SCI were assessed by behavioral analysis using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor test. The alterations in pro-/anti-apoptotic protein levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in spinal cord and frontal cortex. In our study, EGF promoted locomotor recovery and motor neuron survival of SCI rats. EGF treatment significantly decreased Bax and increased Bcl-2 protein expressions both in spinal cord and brain when compared to SCI group. Moreover, antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were increased following EGF treatment similar to MP treatment. Our experiment also suggests that alteration of the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax may result from decreased apoptosis following EGF treatment. As a conclusion, these results show, for the first time, that administration of EGF exerts its protection via regulating apoptotic and oxidative pathways in response to spinal cord injury in different regions of central nervous system."

Timely management is required in polytrauma patients with a spinal cord injury. A high oxygen saturation level must be maintained and a mean arterial blood pressure of 85 mm Hg is recommended. Reduction via traction or urgent surgical decompression, as indicated, should be considered. Reduction that is performed within a few hours postinjury may reverse neurologic deficits, and decompression that is performed within 24 hours postinjury increases the likelihood of substantial recovery. Neuroprotection with the use of methylprednisolone is not recommended in polytrauma patients with a cervical spine injury. Early surgical treatment is safe in polytrauma patients with a cervical spine injury who are adequately resuscitated. The surgical approach is directed by the fracture type and the requirements for decompression.

Expression of transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 genes was determined using real-time quantitative PCR. BMMSCs intervention better promoted recovery of nerve function of rats with SCI, mitigated nerve cell damage, and decreased expression of transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 genes than MP and/or VC.

The search yielded 723 citations, 13 of which satisfied inclusion criteria. Among these, 6 were primary research articles and 7 were previous systematic reviews. Based on the included research articles, there was moderate evidence that the 24-hour NASCIS II (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies) MPSS regimen has no impact on long-term neurological recovery when all postinjury time points are considered. However, there is also moderate evidence that subjects receiving the same MPSS regimen within 8 hours of injury achieve an additional 3.2 points (95% confidence interval = 0.10 to 6.33; P = .04) of motor recovery compared with patients receiving placebo or no treatment. Although safe to administer, a 24-hour NASCIS II MPSS regimen, when all postinjury time points are considered, has no impact on indices of long-term neurological recovery. When commenced within 8 hours of injury, however, a high-dose 24-hour regimen of MPSS confers a small positive benefit on long-term motor recovery and should be considered a treatment option for patients with SCI."

In recent years, curcumin has served as a potential and novel therapeutic drug in SCI. Our study was intended to investigate the precise effect of MP and curcumin in SCI. We examined the function of MP and curcumin in a SCI model rat, both in vivo and in vitro, and found that there was a momentous improvement in Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores in the MP-treated group when compared with Cur-treated group within 14 days. Results obtained from the histological, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural examinations evidenced the curative effect of MP was better than curcumin before Day 14. Nonetheless, there was a significant variation in the treatment effect between the MP-treated and Cur-treated groups after 14 days. The curcumin's effectiveness was more obvious than MP after 14 days following SCI. As such, we surmise that curcumin has a better therapeutic potential than MP with a prolong treatment time in the wake of SCI. Anat Rec, 301:686-696, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Solexa high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze differential gene expression. Compared with methylprednisolone alone, differential expression of 316 genes was detected in injured spinal cord treated with methotrexate and methylprednisolone. The 275 up-regulated genes were mainly related to nerve recovery, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions, while 41 down-regulated genes were mainly related to proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic functions. These results indicate that methotrexate combined with methylprednisolone exhibited better effects on inhibiting the activity of inflammatory cytokines and enhancing antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects and thereby produced stronger neuroprotective effects than methotrexate alone.

MPSS treatment became the standard of care in adults despite a lack of evidence supporting clinical benefit. More recently, new guidelines from neurological surgeon groups recommended no longer using MPSS for ASCI, due to questionable clinical benefit and known complications. However, little information exists in the pediatric population regarding MPSS use in the setting of ASCI. The aim of this paper was to describe steroid use and side effects in patients with ASCI at the authors' Level 1 pediatric trauma center in order to inform other hospitals that may still use this therapy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine adherence in ordering and delivery according to the guideline of the authors' institution and to determine types and frequency of complications. Inclusion criteria included age < 17 years, blunt trauma, physician concern for ASCI, and admission for ≥ 24 hours or treatment with high-dose intravenous MPSS. Exclusion criteria included penetrating trauma, no documentation of ASCI, and incomplete medical records. Charts were reviewed for a predetermined list of complications. RESULTS A total of 602 patient charts were reviewed; 354 patients were included in the study. MPSS was administered in 59 cases. In 34 (57.5%) the order was placed correctly. In 13 (38.2%) of these 34 cases, MPSS was administered according to the recommended timeline protocol. Overall, only 13 (22%) of 59 patients received the therapy according to protocol with regard to accurate ordering and administration. Among the patients with ASCI, 20 (55.6%) of the 36 who received steroids had complications, which was a significantly higher rate than in those who did not receive steroids (8 [24.2%] of 33, p = 0.008). Among the patients without ASCI, 10 (43.5%) of the 23 who received steroids also experienced significantly more complications than patients who did not receive steroids (50 [19.1%] of 262, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS High-dose MPSS for ASCI was not delivered to pediatric patients according to protocol with a high degree of reliability. Patients receiving steroids for pediatric ASCI were significantly more likely to experience complications than patients not receiving steroids. The findings presented, including complications of steroid use, support removal of high-dose MPSS as a treatment option for pediatric ASCI."

There is a prolonged recovery phase, which may continue for many years. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an uncommon relapsing inflammatory central nervous system condition in which TM can be the first presenting symptom. As TM and NMO affect many patients in the prime of their working life, the disorder can impose a significant demand on health resources. There are currently no robust controlled trials in children or adults to inform the optimal treatment of TM. However, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is being effectively used in the management of a range of neurological conditions. Although other interventions such as plasma exchange (PLEX) in addition to intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone therapy can be beneficial in TM, PLEX is costly and technically challenging to deliver in the acute setting. IVIG is more readily accessible and less costly. To evaluate whether additional and early treatment with IVIG is of extra benefit in TM compared with standard therapy with IV steroids. A multicentre, single-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial of IVIG compared with standard therapy for the treatment of TM in adults and children. Patients aged ≥ 1 year diagnosed with either acute first-onset TM or first presentation of NMO. Target recruitment was 170 participants (85 participants per arm). Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to treatment with IV methylprednisolone only or treatment with IV methylprednisolone plus 2 g/kg of IVIG in divided doses within 5 days of the first commencement of steroid therapy. Primary outcome measure - American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale at 6 months post randomisation, with a good outcome defined by a two-grade change. Secondary and tertiary outcome measures - ASIA motor and sensory scales, Expanded Disability Status Scale, health outcome, quality of life, Client Service Receipt Inventory and International Spinal Cord Injury Pain, Bladder and Bowel Basic Data Sets. In total, 26 participants were screened and two were randomised into the study. With the limited sample size, treatment effect could not be determined. However, we identified barriers to accrual that included strict inclusion criteria, the short enrolment window, challenges associated with the use of the ASIA Impairment Scale as an outcome measure and estimation of the incidence of TM. The study did not reach the end point and the effect of IVIG in TM/NMO could not be determined.

SCI did not affect mechanical (df: 24, 145; F=0.5; p=0.09), and cold allodynia (df: 24, 145; F=0.3; p=0.17) but significantly increased mechanical (df: 24, 145; F=21.4; p<0.001) and heat hyperalgesia (df: 24, 145; F=16.1; p<0.001). Treatment with MPSS and 1 and 2-weeks LLLT improved mechanical hyperalgesia (p<0.05) and heat hyperalgesia (p<0.01). The increased level of IL-6 following SCI was also compensated by administration of MPSS or LLLT (df: 4, 10; F=8.74; p=0.003). Findings show that long periods of LLLT have better effects in improving the complication of SCI. In summation, since LLLT does not cause the side effects of MPSS, long-term use of LLLT may be a proper alternative for MPSS in decreasing post SCI side effects."

Expediently delivering interventions during the early postinjury period can have a tremendous impact on long-term functional recovery. This is largely due to the unique pathophysiology of SCI where the initial traumatic insult (primary injury) is followed by a progressive secondary injury cascade characterized by ischemia, proapoptotic signaling, and peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration. Over the subsequent hours, release of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic debris (DNA, ATP, reactive oxygen species) cyclically adds to the harsh postinjury microenvironment. As the lesions mature into the chronic phase, regeneration is severely impeded by the development of an astroglial-fibrous scar surrounding coalesced cystic cavities. Addressing these challenges forms the basis of current and upcoming treatments for SCI. This paper discusses the evidence-based management of a patient with SCI while emphasizing the importance of early definitive care. Key neuroprotective therapies are summarized including surgical decompression, methylprednisolone, and blood pressure augmentation. We then review exciting neuroprotective interventions on the cusp of translation such as Riluzole, Minocycline, magnesium, therapeutic hypothermia, and CSF drainage. We also explore the most promising neuroregenerative strategies in trial today including Cethrin™, anti-NOGO antibody, cell-based approaches, and bioengineered biomaterials. Each section provides a working knowledge of the key preclinical and patient trials relevant to clinicians while highlighting the pathophysiologic rationale for the therapies. We conclude with our perspectives on the future of treatment and research in this rapidly evolving field."

In the current study, 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone was injected into rats with spinal cord injury immediately post-injury and at 1 and 2 days post-injury.

Because of their potent anti-inflammatory effects, they have been introduced in multiple sclerosis (MS). Investigation has shown not only an anti-inflammatory, but also supposed neuroprotective mechanism of action. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in a mouse model of traumatic SCI. SCI was produced by extradural compression for 1 min of the spinal cord at the T6-7 level using an aneurysm clip, and DMF and MMF (both at 30 mg/kg) were administered by oral gavage to the mice 1 and 6 h after SCI. For locomotor activity, study mice were treated with FAEs once daily for 10 days. We observed that mice treated with DMF exhibited a significant and sustained recovery of motor function. FAEs significantly reduced the severity of inflammation by a modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis factors, and increased neutrophic factors such as anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), anti-glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT3). Our results showed important protective effects of DMF in an animal model of SCI, considerably improving recovery of motor function, possibly by reducing the secondary inflammation and tissue injury that characterize this model.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 μg 17β-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c)."

The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 μg/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 μg was found to be as effective as 100 μg in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes. Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury.

Sixteen adult beagle dogs with SCI were assigned to four treatment groups: control, MPSS, AD-MSCs, and AD-MSCs + MPSS. Additionally, one dog was used to evaluate the distribution of AD-MSCs in the body after injection. AD-MSCs (1 × 10(7) cells) were injected intravenously once a day for 3 days beginning at 6 hours post-SCI. MPSS was also injected intravenously according to the standard protocol for acute SCI. A revised Tarlov scale was used to evaluate hindlimb functional recovery. The levels of markers for oxidative metabolism (3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl) and inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were also measured. At 7 days post-treatment, hindlimb movement had improved in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; however, subjects in the groups treated with MPSS exhibited gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed fewer hemorrhages and lesser microglial infiltration in the AD-MSCs group. The green fluorescent protein-expressing AD-MSCs were clearly detected in the lung, spleen, and injured spinal cord; however, these cells were not detected in the liver and un-injured spinal cord. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine were decreased in the MPSS and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; 4-hydroxynenonal and cyclooxygenase-2 levels were decreased in all treatment groups; and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator transcription 3 levels were decreased in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups. Our results suggest that early intravenous injection of AD-MSCs after acute SCI may prevent further damage through enhancement of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, without inducing adverse effects. Additionally, this treatment could also be used as an alternative intravenous treatment modality for acute SCI."

In all groups, the spinal cord injury model was created by the weight drop method. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined by kit. Histopathological examination was also performed. Neurological evaluation was carried out with the Tarlov scoring system. The results showed both MP and PDMSCs had neuroprotective effects, and combining the administration of MP with PDMSCs was shown a significant effect on the recovery of neurological function. Therefore, the combined use of MP and PDMSCs can be used as a potential therapeutic method for SCI."

G-CSF, but not MP, in rats with SCI. In addition, G-CSF significantly decreased the expression of astrocytic TGF-β1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein around the injury site. Furthermore, rats with G-CSF treatment showed increased neurofilament expression beyond the glial scars. Direct i.t. administration of G-CSF provides a promising therapeutic option for SCI or related spinal diseases."

The purpose of this project was to investigate the early dynamic changes and MP's efficacy on axonal damage, blood flow, and calcium influx into axons in a mouse SCI model. YFP H-line and Thy1-GCaMP transgenic mice were used in this study. Two-photon microscopy was used for imaging of axonal dieback, blood flow, and calcium influx post-injury. We found that MP treatment attenuated progressive damage of axons, increased blood flow, and reduced calcium influx post-injury. Furthermore, microglia/macrophages accumulated in the lesion site after SCI and expressed the proinflammatory mediators iNOS, MCP-1 and IL-1β. MP treatment markedly inhibited the accumulation of microglia/macrophages and reduced the expression of the proinflammatory mediators. MP treatment also improved the recovery of behavioral function post-injury.

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI."

The combination of MP and other pharmacological agents aimed at enhancing functional recovery is desirable as the beneficial effects of MP are controversial, due to a variety of side-effects. Aminoguanidine (AG), a small water-soluble compound, is potentially useful in the treatment of acute SCI. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of MP and AG, administered in combination, following SCI in adult rats. In rats with SCI, the combination therapy group treated with AG (75 mg/kg) and MP (0.75 mg/kg) exhibited significantly reduced levels of cytokine expression and cell apoptosis compared with those in the control group. In addition, the data demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly enhanced the recovery of limb function. These data clearly suggest that treatment with a combination of MP and AG represents a promising strategy of clinically applicable pharmacological therapy for the rapid initiation of neuroprotection following SCI."

Although some aspects of the immune response are beneficial, it is thought that leukocyte recruitment and activation in the acute phase of injury results in the production of cytotoxic substances that are harmful to the nervous tissue. Therefore, suppression of excessive inflammation in the spinal cord could serve as a therapeutic strategy to attenuate tissue damage. The immunosuppressant methylprednisolone has been used in the setting of SCI, but there are complications which have attenuated the initial enthusiasm. Hence, there is interest in other immunomodulatory approaches, such as intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIg). Importantly, IVIg is used clinically for the treatment of several auto-immune neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIPD) and Kawasaki disease, with a good safety profile. Thus, it is a promising treatment candidate for SCI. Indeed, IVIg has been shown by our team to attenuate the immune response and result in improved neurobehavioral recovery following cervical SCI in rats through a mechanism that involves the attenuation of neutrophil recruitment and reduction in the levels of cytokines and cytotoxic enzymes Nguyen et al. (J Neuroinflammation 9:224, 2012). Here we review published data in the context of relevant mechanisms of action that have been proposed for IVIg in other conditions. We hope that this discussion will trigger future research to provide supporting evidence for the efficiency and detailed mechanisms of action of this promising drug in the treatment of SCI, and to facilitate its clinical translation."

We demonstrated functional restoration of injured spinal cord by self-assembled nanoparticles composed of ferulic acid modified glycol chitosan (FA-GC). Chitosan and ferulic acid are strong neuroprotective agents but their systemic delivery is difficult. Our data has shown a prolonged circulation time of the FA-GC nanoparticles allowing for effective delivery of both chitosan and ferulic acid to the injured site. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were found both in the gray matter and white matter. The in vitro tests demonstrated that nanoparticles protected primary neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Using a spinal cord contusion injury model, significant recovery in locomotor function was observed in rats that were intravenously administered nanoparticles at 2 h post injury, as compared to non-improvement by methylprednisolone administration. Histological analysis revealed that FA-GC treatment significantly preserved axons and myelin and also reduced cavity volume, astrogliosis, and inflammatory response at the lesion site. No obvious adverse effects of nanoparticles to other organs were found. The restorative effect of FA-GC presents a promising potential for treating human SCIs."

The SCI animals were randomly assigned to five groups: sham control group, SCI model group, the methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) group, the 10 mg/kg apigenin treatment group and the 20 mg/kg apigenin treatment group. First, neuronal function after SCI was evaluated with Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) and the result showed that injured animals treated with apigenin showed a significant increase in BBB scores. To explore the underlying mechanism, antioxidative effect of apigenin was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities after SCI. Apigenin treatment reversed the decrease of SOD and GSH-Px activity, and the increase of MDA level caused by SCI, suggesting its antioxidative role in response to the injury. In addition, apigenin treatment decreased serum interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 release after SCI, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin. Finally, apigenin treatment affected the expression level of apoptosis-related gene Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3, which indicated its antiapoptosis role after SCI.

The results showed that both infliximab and MP could lower the expressions of NF-κB, TRADD, and FADD 24 hours after the ASCI, and increased Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan score on the 14th and the 21st days after ASCI, suggesting possible neuroprotective effectiveness on attenuating the severity of neurological deficits and improving the locomotor function in the rat ASCI model. Moreover, infliximab combined with MP exhibited the more powerful ability to this amelioration. Infliximab combined with methylprednisolone may be an effective treatment for the recovery of ASCI. Further study is needed to determine if this neuroprotective effect is seen for long-term outcomes especially in human ASCI."

Because of its controversial beneficial effects, the combination of MP and other pharmacological agents aimed at enhancing functional recovery is desirable. The phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram has been implicated in promotion of regeneration due to elevating cAMP. In the present study, we sought to determine the effects of MP and rolipram, administered in combination, after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats. Here we show that in vitro administration of rolipram and MP significantly increased neuron survival and promoted neurite outgrowth of neurons on the inhibitory substrate CSPGs by upregulation of MMP-2 expression; in vivo administration of rolipram and MP inhibited CSPG expression and increase CSPG digestion after rat SCI. Rolipram and MP combining treatment promoted significant neuroprotection through reduced motoneuron death, minimized lesion cavity, and increased regeneration of lesioned corticospinal tract (CST) axons beyond the lesion site after SCI. Enhanced functional recovery was also observed. Overall, our study strongly suggested that the combination treatment of MP and rolipram may represent a promising strategy for clinically applicable pharmacological therapy for rapid initiation of neuroprotection after SCI."

Removal of reactive species may reduce secondary damage following SCI. This study explored the effectiveness of a catalytic antioxidant - Mn (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) - in removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress, and improving functional recovery in vivo in a rat impact SCI model. The efficiency of MnTBAP was also compared with that of methylprednisolone - the only drug used clinically in treating acute SCI. In vivo measurements of time courses of ROS production by microdialysis and microcannula sampling in MnTBAP, methylprednisolone, and saline (as vehicle control)-treated SCI rats showed that both agents significantly reduced the production of hydrogen peroxide, but only MnTBAP significantly reduced superoxide elevation after SCI. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that MnTBAP scavenged both of the preceding ROS, whereas methylprednisolone had no effect on either. By counting the immuno-positive neurons in the spinal cord sections immunohistochemically stained with anti-nitrotyrosine and anti-4-hydroxy-nonenal antibodies as the markers of protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation, we demonstrated that MnTBAP significantly reduced the numbers of 4-hydroxy-nonenal-positive and nitrotyrosine-positive neurons in the sections at 1.55 to 2.55 mm and 1.1 to 3.1 mm, respectively, rostral to the injury epicenter compared to the vehicle-treated animals. By behavioral tests (open field and inclined plane tests), we demonstrated that at 4 hours post-SCI treatment with MnTBAP and the standard methylprednisolone regimen both significantly increased test scores compared to those produced by vehicle treatment. However, the outcomes for MnTBAP-treated rats were significantly better than those for methylprednisolone-treated animals. This study demonstrated for the first time in vivo and in vitro that MnTBAP significantly reduced the levels of SCI-elevated ROS and that MnTBAP is superior to methylprednisolone in removing ROS. Removal of ROS by MnTBAP significantly reduced protein nitration and membrane lipid peroxidation in neurons. MnTBAP more effectively reduced neurological deficits than did methylprednisolone after SCI - the first most important criterion for assessing SCI treatments. These results support the therapeutic potential of MnTBAP in treating SCI."

A rat model of acute SCI was established using the modified Allen's method. At 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 14 days after injury, injured T10 spinal cord specimens were harvested. GB significantly increased inclined plane test scores and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale scores in SCI rats from postoperative day 3 to day 14. The effect was equal to that of the positive control drug, MP. Western blot analysis showed that JAK(2) was significantly phosphorylated from 4 h after SCI, peaked at 12 h and gradually decreased thereafter, accompanied by phosphorylation of STAT(3) with a similar time course. GB was shown to significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of JAK(2) and STAT(3) in rats with SCI. It significantly increased the ratio of B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) protein expression at 24 h, led to an obvious down-regulation of caspase-3 gene and protein expression at 3 days, and significantly decreased the cell apoptosis index at each time point after SCI. This effect was similar to that obtained with the JAK-specific inhibitor, AG490. Our experimental findings indicated that GB can protect rats against acute SCI, and that its underlying mechanism may be related to the inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation, improvement of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, decreased caspase-3 gene and protein expression and further inhibition of secondary cell apoptosis following SCI."

At 24 h post-SCI, there was a massive loss of motor function and cysts formation in the spinal cord. The SCI mice, following 3 days and onwards, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the population and hypertrophy of GFAP + astrocytes, suggesting the occurrence of reactive astrogliosis. Intra-fourth ventricular administration of CART (54-102) or intravenous treatment with MP, dose dependently improved motor function score, while CART-antibody (intra-fourth ventricular) was ineffective. This neuroprotective effect of MP was potentiated by the subeffective dose of CART and antagonized by CART-antibody. CART or MP treatment not only prevented the cysts formation, but also significantly attenuated the population of GFAP + astrocytes at days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-SCI and the hypertrophy of astrocytes at day 14 and 28. The histological consequence of SCI, like cysts formation in the spinal cord, was rapidly improved by CART and/or MP. Taken together, the data suggest that CART may exert its neuroprotective effect via inhibition of post-SCI astrogliosis and participate in the MP mediated neuroprotection."

Although neurological deficit is usually related to the severity of spinal injury, this is different in spinal cord concussion. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate a group of 24 patients with spinal cord concussion, to design a diagnostic algorithm and propose an effective therapy with a good prognosis for the patients. We reviewed clinical records of 9 768 patients hospitalised at the Department of Spinal Surgery, University Hospital in Motol, from September 2002 till December 2010, and of 457 patients treated at other departments of the Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010; this was a total of 10 225 patients. The data were retrospectively analysed and only the patients with a clear history of trauma and subsequent conservative therapy were selected to comprise a group characterised by the generally known criteria of spinal cord concussion: (1) spinal injury with immediate neurological deficit of varying degree; (2) neurological deficit corresponding to the level of spinal injury; (3) recovery of neurological function within 72 hours of injury; (4) no morphological evidence of injury to the spinal structures obtained by imaging methods. This group comprised 24 patients. The patients were followed up from 6 to 95 months, with a mean of 46 months and a median of 48 months, at intervals of 6 and 12 weeks and 6 and 12 months after injury, and then every following year. The recorded information included the patient's age at the time of injury, their gender, the mechanism of injury, reports on alcohol consumption, the first detected neurological deficit, its development immediately after injury, during the hospital stay and at follow-ups in the out-patient department, methylprednisolone administration according to the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) 2, and findings of imaging methods, particularly MRI. Our group consisted of 22 men (91.7%) and two women (8.3%), with an average age of 29 years; the average age was 30 years in men and 18.5 years in women. Seven patients (29.2%) were younger than 18 years, with an average of 16.14 years; the remaining 17 patients (70.8%) were older than 18 years, with an average of 34.35 years. The major mechanisms of injury included falls from a height in 10 patients (41.7%) and injury due to alcohol consumption in five patients (20.1%). Clinical findings involved lesions of the medullary cone in 12 (50.0%), cervical spinal cord in seven (29.2%) and thoracic spinal cord in five (20.8%) patients. Motor function deficit was present in all patients, of whom 10 (41.2%) showed a complete loss of motor function. Impaired sensory function was found in 21 (87.5%) patients. One patient had perianal and genital sensory deficit and one (4.2%) had urinary retention. Neither radiograms nor CT scans showed traumatic changes in any of the patients; MRI findings free of any traumatic spinal changes were recorded in 21 patients (87.5%). One patient had oedema of the T5 and T8 vertebral bodies. No complications were recorded. All patients experienced rapid resolution of neurological deficit, which occurred within 6 hours of injury in two (8.4%), within 12 hours in two (8.4%), within 24 hours in 12 (50.0%) and within 48 hours in six (25.0%) patients, and later than 48 hours after injury in two patients (8.4%). However, recovery always occurred within 72 hours of injury. A good prognosis for patients with this injury is supported by our findings, because all patients experienced rapid resolution of neurological deficit within 72 hours of injury. This result is in agreement with the relevant international studies reporting no serious complications associated with spinal trauma. There are no clear recommendations for administration of high doses of methylprednisolone according to the NASCIS system. Spinal cord concussion is not a frequent injury; in our study, it accounted for 3.54% of the patients with trauma histories out of the total number of 678 patients, or for 2.40% out of 997 injured spinal levels. The first steps should be the same as in any other injury to the spinal cord. An early examination of the patient with imaging methods including MRI is of primary importance. At present administration of methylprednisolone according to the NASCIS system is disputable. The patient diagnosed with spinal cord concussion has a good prognosis, with rehabilitation as the main therapeutic approach."

Forty adult Wistar albino rats were randomized into five groups: control, SCI alone (50 g/cm weight drop), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) (30 mg/kg), curcumin + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (300 mg/kg), and DMSO alone (0.1 mg/kg).

Curcumin was more effective than DMSO and MPSS in reducing LPO, whereas DMSO was more effective than curcumin and MPSS in minimizing ultrastuctural changes. The results of this study indicate that curcumin exerts a beneficial effect by decreasing LPO and may reduce tissue damage. Since ultrastructural and neurological findings does not support biochemical finding, our findings do not exclude the possibility that curcumin has a protective effect on the spinal cord ultrastructure and neurological recovery after SCI.

Failure to adhere to certain guiding principles can be detrimental to the long-term neurologic and functional outcome of these patients. Therapy for the hyperacute phase of traumatic SCI focuses on stabilizing vital signs and follows the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) algorithm for ensuring stability of airway, breathing and circulation, and disability (neurologic evaluation)-with spinal stabilization-and exposure. Spinal stabilization, with cervical collars and long backboards, is used to prevent movement of a potentially unstable spinal column injury to prevent further injury to the spinal cord and nerve roots, especially during prehospital transport. Surgery to stabilize the spine is undertaken after life-threatening injuries (hemorrhage, evacuation of intracranial hemorrhage, acute vascular compromise) are addressed. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission is to be considered for all patients with high SCI or hemodynamic instability, as well as those with other injuries that independently warrant ICU admission. Avoidance of hypotension and hypoxia may minimize secondary neurologic injury. Elevating the mean arterial pressure above 85 mmHg for 7 days should be considered, to allow for spinal cord perfusion. The use of intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone) is controversial. Early tracheostomy in patients with lesions above C5 may reduce the number of ventilator days and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Select patients may benefit from the placement of a diaphragmatic pacer. Aggressive measures, including CoughAssist and Intermittent Positive Pressure Breaths (IPPB), should be used to maintain lung recruitment and aid in the mobilization of secretions. Some patients with high SCI who are dependent on mechanical ventilation can eventually be liberated from the ventilator with consistent efforts from both the patient and the caregiver, along with some patience. Intermittent catheterization by the patient or a caregiver may be associated with a lower incidence of urinary tract infections, compared with an in-dwelling urinary catheter. Early mobilization of patients and a multidisciplinary approach (including respiratory therapists, nutritional experts, physical therapists, and occupational therapists) can streamline care and may improve long-term outcomes. A number of investigational drugs and therapies offer hope of neurologic recovery for some patients."

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 02 Aug 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2011, issue 3 (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1948 to July Week 3 2011, EMBASE (Ovid) 1974 to 2011 week 17, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to Aug 2011, ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to Aug 2011 and PubMed [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/] (searched 04 Aug 2011) for records added to PubMed in the last 90 days). Files of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) were reviewed (NASCIS was founded in 1977 and has tracked trials in this area since that date). We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and previously published reviews. All randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. One review author extracted data from trial reports. Japanese and French studies were found through NASCIS and additional data (e.g. SDs) were obtained from the original study authors. Eight trials are included in this review, seven used methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post-injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg over 15 minutes, with maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial results were replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data was obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This indicated significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy, when administration commenced within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that, if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status are observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries. A modified regimen was found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. The risk of bias was low in the largest methyprednisolne trials. Overall, there was no evidence of significantly increased complications or mortality from the 23 or 48 hour therapy. High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. One trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. There is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacologic therapy for acute spinal cord injury."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a major public health issue in developed countries as well as worldwide. The pathophysiology of SCI is characterized by an initial primary injury followed by secondary deterioration. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of SCI remain to be fully understood, it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress have a significant role in the pathophysiology of SCI. Thus, alleviating oxidative stress may be an effective strategy for therapeutic intervention of SCI. The aim of this review was to describe (i) the sources of ROS as well as the major antioxidant defenses with particular attention being paid to lipid peroxidation; (ii) the biomarkers of oxidative stress in SCI and (iii) the neuroprotective effects of various compounds with antioxidative properties in animal models of SCI. PubMed, one of the most comprehensive biomedical databases, was searched from 1976-2011. All relevant papers were read by title, abstract and full-length article. Oxidative stress is considered a hallmark of injury of SCI. Thus, alleviating oxidative stress may be an effective way of therapeutic intervention of SCI. Two of these agents, the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone and the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad, have been shown to possess significant antioxidant activities and improve recovery of SCI patients in clinical trials. Other promising botanical compounds and their molecular targets and mechanisms of action with regard to potential protection against SCI were also described. These include carotenoids and phenolic compounds. ROS and oxidative stress have a significant role in the pathophysiology of SCI. Alleviating oxidative stress is be an effective strategy for therapeutic intervention of SCI. Extensive research over the past several decades has identified numerous bioactive compounds that have antioxidative stress benefits in animal models of SCI. Thus, continued studies on bioactive compounds with ROS-scavenging capacity may lead to the development of effective antioxidant-based modalities for treating SCI in human subjects."

A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted. Two-hundred and one patients were randomized to 1 of 4 analgesic epidural pastes at the time of lumbar spinal surgery: combination paste (morphine + methylprednisolone), steroid paste (methylprednisolone alone), morphine paste (morphine alone), or placebo. The primary outcome measures used were analgesic consumption and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Secondary outcome measures were: modified American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) score, Short Form 36 General Health Survey (SF-36), Aberdeen Pain Index (ABPI), time to ambulation and time to discharge from hospital. Administration of combination and steroid paste, but not morphine paste, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI) components of the MPQ in the first 3 days after surgery. Likewise, postoperative in-patient narcotic analgesic consumption was reduced in the combination paste and steroid paste group, but not in the morphine paste group. No difference in time to ambulation or discharge, SF-36 scores, ABPI scores, or neurologic recovery was observed. An analgesic paste containing methylprednisolone acetate is effective at reducing postoperative pain after lumbar decompressive surgery. Mixing effective doses of morphine sulfate in the paste abrogates the expected analgesic effects of epidural morphine."

Previous data from our laboratory indicate that estrogen (17β-estradiol) at a high dose may attenuate multiple damaging pathways involved in SCI and improve locomotor outcome. Since use of high dose estrogen may have detrimental side effects and therefore may never be used in the clinic, the current study investigated the efficacy of this steroid hormone at very low doses in SCI. In particular, we tested the impact of dosing (1-10 μg/kg), mode of delivery (intravenous vs. osmotic pump), and delay in estrogen application (15 min-4 h post-SCI) on microgliosis and neuronal death in acute SCI in rats. Treatment with 17β-estradiol (1-10 μg/kg) significantly reduced microglial activation and also attenuated apoptosis of neurons compared to untreated SCI animals. The attenuation of cell death and inflammation by estrogen was observed regardless of mode and time of delivery following injury. These findings suggest estrogen as a potential agent for the treatment of individuals with SCI."

Thus, to minimize apoptosis and irradiation risks after SCI, this study investigated the effects of steroid injections before irradiation. Thirty-two rats were used for the experimental procedure. After a traumatic SCI, they were divided into 4 groups of 8 rats each: (1) a control group that only had rats with a SCI (Group 1); (2) a group that received MP at 30 minutes, 6 hours and 24 hours, and then received irradiation 2 days after the SCI (Group 2); (3) a group that received MP at 30 minutes, and irradiation 2 days after the SCI (Group 3); and (4) a group that received irradiation 2 days after the traumatic SCI (Group 4). The degree of recovery using the inclined plane climbing test was greatest in Group 2, followed by Group 3, Group 4, and Group 1. The cavitation lesions, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling -positive apoptosis, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocyte count, and CC-1-positive oligodendrocyte count significantly decreased in the irradiated groups (Groups 2, 3, 4) compared to the control group (Group 1).

At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p<0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p<0.05).

Early spinal decompression and stabilization was performed as soon after injury in both the groups. According to The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score, there was an average improvement by 3 months postinjury of 12.4 points in the MPSS group and 13.8 points in the non-MPSS group. In patients with complete motor loss, average ASIA motor score improved 9.0 points in the MPSS group and 12.6 points in the non-MPSS group. For patients with incomplete motor loss, average ASIA motor score improvement was 14.1 and 15.5 points in the MPSS and non-MPSS groups, respectively.In the MPSS group, 19 patients developed pneumonia, 13 developed urinary tract infections, and 5 developed wound infections. Incidence of pneumonia was significantly increased with the use of MPSS medication.

However, many have questioned the efficacy of MPSS because of its marginal effects. Additionally there has been criticism of both study design and statistical interpretation. The functional consequences of experimental SCI have been assessed in many ways. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of MPSS vs. saline solution (SS) following moderate T10 contusion injury in rat. Functional recovery was evaluated using the 21-point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor recovery scale, the inclined plane, the beam walk, footprint analysis and the horizontal ladder. To optimize the precision and accuracy of functional results we examined the locomotion on a treadmill using three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Stereology was used to estimate the amount of damaged tissue. The results of the traditional functional methods showed that administration of the NASCIS dosage of MPSS following acute spinal cord contusion did not lead to any significant differences in the functional recovery of MPSS- vs. SS-treated animals. More importantly, the results of the 3D kinematic showed that the MPSS administration did not affect the flexion/extension of the hip, knee and ankle joints during the step cycle. Finally, stereological results revealed no statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups. Altogether, our results support data previously reported by several authors, suggesting that MPSS does not lead to improved functional outcome following experimental acute SCI."

In order to prove if early metabolic reactivation is a better therapeutic option than antioxidant therapy in the acute phase of TSCI, spinal cord contusions were performed in adult rats using a well-characterized weight drop technique at thoracic 9 level. After TSCI, pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase (NDC) enzyme was used to maintain energy levels, antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and catalase (ANT) were used to decrease oxidative damage and methylprednisolone (MP), which has both therapeutic properties, was used as a control. Rats were divided into one sham group and six with TSCI; one of them received no treatment, and the rest were treated with NDC, MP, NDC + MP, NDC + ANT or ANT. The ANT group decreased lactate and creatine phosphokinase levels and increased the amount of preserved tissue (morphometric analysis) as well as functional recovery (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan or BBB motor scale). In contrast, NDC treatment increased lipid peroxidation, measured through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, as well as spinal cord tissue destruction and functional deficit. Early metabolic reactivation after a TSCI may be deleterious, while natural early metabolic inhibition may not be a ""secondary mechanism of injury"" but a ""secondary neuroprotective response"". While increased antioxidant defence after a TSCI may currently be an ideal therapeutic strategy, the usefulness of metabolic reactivation should be tested in the sub-acute or chronic phases of TSCI and new strategies must continue to be tested for the early ones."

The literature survey has led to the following conclusions: 1. The primary zone of traumatic damage enlarges due to local vascular disturbances, hypoxia, and the resulting inflammation. 2.

Our purpose was to explore emergency department (ED) response to this shifting information by assessing the impact of NASCIS and the 2002 report on MPSS protocols and to study factors associated with MPSS administration. Availability of protocols and hospital characteristics were determined by survey of all hospitals with EDs in South Carolina. Protocol copies were obtained and reviewed for accuracy based on NASCIS. Patient hospital discharge information was collected through the state Office of Research and Statistics, and factors associated with receiving MPSS were evaluated using multivariable techniques. Having a protocol was associated with trauma level designation and volume of traumatic spinal cord injury patients per annum, with 100% of Level I trauma facilities having a protocol. Across all trauma levels, 40% of reporting EDs had an MPSS protocol, with 86% of these accurate, and none withdrawn during the study. Patient factors associated with being less likely to receive MPSS were female gender, injury below thoracic level, and treatment in an undesignated trauma center. Shifting information on the benefit of MPSS did not lead to withdrawal of protocols over the study time period.

In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007). We established that the 254 micromol/kg dose of MgCl(2) was superior to 127 micromol/kg MgCl(2) with respect to tissue sparing and locomotor recovery. Additionally, the number of infusions (2, 4, or 6), time between infusions (6 vs 8 hours), and different magnesium salts (MgCl(2) vs MgSO(4)) were evaluated to determine an ""optimal"" treatment regimen. We observed that an ""optimized"" regimen of MgCl(2) within PEG conferred greater tissue neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery compared to methylprednisolone.

Sixty-two studies were included, which involved a wide variety of animal species and strains. Overall, beneficial effects of MP administration were obtained in 34% of the studies, no effects in 58%, and mixed results in 8%. The results were inconsistent both among and within species, even when attempts were made to detect any patterns in the results through subgroup analyses.

Surgical decompression is known to improve clinical outcomes, but the timing of surgical decompression remains controversial. A nylon tie was used to constrict the spinal cord in 18 adult male beagle dogs. The animals were then prospectively randomized to 3 groups: 1) surgical decompression at 6 hours and intravenous methylprednisolone; 2) surgical decompression at 6 hours and intravenous saline; and 3) intravenous methylprednisolone without surgical decompression. Each animal was evaluated by somatosensory-evoked potentials, daily neurologic assessment, and histologic examination at 2 weeks following injury. Immediately following spinal cord constriction, all animals were paraplegic, incontinent, and the somatosensory-evoked potentials were abolished. Surgical decompression 6 hours after injury, with or without methylprednisolone, led to significantly better neurologic function at 2 weeks than methylprednisolone alone. In the setting of acute and persistent spinal cord compression in beagle dogs, surgical decompression 6 hours after injury, with or without methylprednisolone, is more effective for improving neurologic recovery than methylprednisolone alone."

Recently, it was reported that interferon-beta possessed significant neuroprotection after experimental transient ischemic stroke. However, to our knowledge, there have been no previous reports about the neuroprotective effect of interferon-beta after spinal cord injury. Rats were randomly allocated into 5 groups. Group 1 was control and after clinical examination, normal spinal cord samples were obtained. Group 2 was introduced 50 g/cm contusion injury. Group 3 was vehicle, immediately after trauma 1 mL of physiologic saline was injected. Group 4 was given 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate intraperitoneally immediately after trauma. Group 5 was given 1 x 10(7) IU interferon-beta immediately and 0.5 x 10(7) IU interferon-beta 4 hours after trauma. Animals were examined by inclined plane and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale 24 hours after trauma. Spinal cord samples obtained following clinical evaluations. Neutrophil infiltration was evaluated by myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation was estimated by thiobarbituric acid test.

We therefore aimed to develop a practical medication for SCI. Per oral treatment with withanoside IV, which was previously shown to regenerate neuronal networks in the brain, improved locomotor functions in mice with SCI. In the spinal cord after SCI, axons were crushed in the white matter and gray matter, and central nervous system (CNS) myelin level decreased. In mice treated with withanoside IV (10micromol/kg body weight/day, for 21 days), axonal density and peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin level increased. The loss of CNS myelin and increase in reactive gliosis were not affected by withanoside IV. These results suggest that oral administration of withanoside IV may ameliorate locomotor functions by facilitating both axonal regrowth and increase in PNS myelin level."

An annual incidence of 15 to 40 traumatic SCI cases per million population has been reported worldwide, and a conservative estimate for Singapore would be 23 cases per million. With continued improvements in medical care, an increasing prevalence of SCI patients is expected, with corresponding need for comprehensive rehabilitation services led by specialist rehabilitation physicians. A literature search, review, and summary of findings of recent studies relating to factors associated with recovery, as well as interventions for rehabilitation and promotion of healing of the injured spinal cord was performed. Many SCI patients show improvements in motoric and neurologic level, but those with complete injuries have poor chance of improving American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores. SCI of violent aetiology tends to be more neurologic complete, and those without sacral sparing less likely to improve. Older patients generally do well in activities of daily living. Women have better motor score improvement, although men have better Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores generally. Electrodiagnostic tests such as somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) can help with prognostication, as can imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Immediate surgery for spinal decompression may improve recovery, but whether routine surgery after SCI improves function remains unclear, as does the timing. Methylprednisolone and similar agents appear to help limit secondary injury processes. Rehabilitation interventions such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) and body-weight supported treadmill ambulation training may be effective, as may neural-controlled prostheses and devices. Substances that promote repair and regeneration of the injured spinal cord such as GM-1, 4-AP, BDNG, GDNF, Nogo and MAG-inhibitors, have been studied. Transplanted tissues and cells, such as blood macrophages, bone marrow transplant with GM-CSF, olfactory ensheathing cells, fetal tissues, stem or progenitor cells, have been reported to produce neurological improvements."

Injured rats received either saline or a single dose of rhEPO within 30 min after SCI. The results showed that the significant improvement of functional outcome observed in rhEPO-treated rats was associated with a better preservation of myelin in the ventral white matter. Moreover, the significant increase of both the number of NG2-positive OPCs and the labeling for Nogo-A, a marker of differentiated oligodendrocytes, suggested that rhEPO treatment could result in the generation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes. Sparing of fiber tracts in the ventral white matter was confirmed by the increased density of the serotonergic plexus around motor neurons. As for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, only phosphacan, increased in saline-treated rats, returned to normal levels in rhEPO group, probably reflecting a better maintenance of glial-axolemmal relationships along nerve fibers. In conclusion, this investigation expands previous studies supporting the pleiotropic neuroprotective effect of rhEPO on secondary degenerative response and its therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCI and confirms that the preservation of the ventral white matter, which contains descending motor pathways, may be critical for limiting functional deficit."

By these means CsA may diminish overproduction of free radicals and secondarily, lipid peroxidation (LP), both observed after acute spinal cord (SC) injury. Studies performed on reliable experimental models, using a well-standardized CsA dosing scheme, showed that a low dose of this drug inhibits the expression and activity of constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthases (NOS), two enzymes strongly involved in the production of NO after SCI. Likewise, this compound inhibits LP. This inhibition is equivalent to the one induced by methylprednisolone (MP) at a high dose, but without the deleterious effects of the latter upon the survival of the animals. Moreover, inhibition of LP by CsA significantly correlates with a decrease in the demyelination process at the epicenter of the lesion, a significant survival of neurons in the red nucleus and enhanced motor recovery in animals submitted to a severe SC contusion. CsA acts as a neuroprotector agent after SC injury; hence, this drug may be useful in the treatment of acute SCI. CsA deserves further study in experimental animal models and in humans."

Neither MP alone nor the combination treatment improved Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan 21-point open-field locomotor scores at 2-12 weeks after SCI. These scores were ~4 points in the control, MP, and combination treatment groups, respectively, at 2 weeks after severe SCI at T4.

Control and MP-treated rats responded to approximately five of 10 stimuli to their backs and three of 10 stimuli to their hind paws. MP treatment increased areas of neurofilament and myelin near the injury site at T4 and T12. Thus, MP treatment spared tissue, but had no corresponding effect on neurological function. In contrast, the combination treatment did not spare myelin significantly. These neurological outcomes after treatment with MP contrast with the consistent and significant improvements after treatment with the anti-CD11d mAb. Effects of MP on the lesion were significant, but myelin sparing was less than that caused by the anti-CD11d mAb. The presence of MP in the combination therapy appeared to reverse the positive effects of the mAb. The poor neurological outcome after MP treatment may relate to the long-lasting reduction in hematogenous monocyte/macrophages within the injury site that it causes and to the prolongation of a neutrophil presence. These findings demonstrate that the non-selective and enduring effects of immunosuppressive therapy with MP not only fail to improve neurological outcomes, but also can block the beneficial actions of selective therapies such as the anti-CD11d mAb. Combination treatments that cause intense immunosuppression should be viewed with caution."

Treatment with an ecto-domain of the rat NgR (27-310) fused to a rat IgG [NgR(310)ecto-Fc] (50 microm intrathecal, 0.25 microL/h for 28 days) or MP alone (30 mg/kg i.v., 0, 4 and 8 h postinjury) improved the rate and extent of functional recovery measured using Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scoring and footprint analysis. The effect of MP treatment on BBB score was apparent the day after SCI whereas the effect of NgR(310)ecto-Fc was not apparent until 2 weeks after SCI. NgR(310)ecto-Fc or MP treatment resulted in increased axonal sprouting and/or regeneration, quantified by counting biotin dextran amine-labeled corticospinal tract axons, and increased the number of axons contacting motor neurons in the ventral horn gray matter caudal to the lesion. Combined treatment with NgR(310)ecto-Fc and MP had a more pronounced effect on recovery of function and axonal growth compared with either treatment alone.

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). In 1990 the results of the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS II) were published, which showed that the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP), which had been previously shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, could improve neurological recovery in spinal-cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI since the drug was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy was obtained in a third NASCIS trial (NASCIS III). In recent years, the use of high-dose MP in acute SCI has become controversial largely on the basis of the risk of serious adverse effects versus what is perceived to be on average a modest neurological benefit. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone was also tested in NASCIS II based upon the demonstration of its beneficial effects in SCI models. Although it did not a significant overall effect, some evidence of efficacy was seen in incomplete (i.e., paretic) patients. The monosialoganglioside GM1 has also been examined in a recently completed clinical trial in which the patients first received high-dose MP treatment. However, GM1 failed to show any evidence of a significant enhancement in the extent of neurological recovery over the level afforded by MP therapy alone. The present paper reviews the past development of MP, naloxone, tirilazad, and GM1 for acute SCI, the ongoing MP-SCI controversy, identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development, and suggests some promising neuroprotective approaches that could either replace or be used in combination with high-dose MP."

Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the spinal cord samples were examined for lipid peroxidation. Spinal cord ultrastructure was evaluated and grading system was used for quantitative evaluation. Trauma increased tissue MDA levels. Treatment with methylprednisolone and phenytoin decreased MDA levels compared to trauma in all doses. Significant ultrastructural neuroprotection was observed with 30 mg/kg of phenytoin treatment according to general neural score.

Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed Wilcoxon test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). There were no complications at insertion of the OFS; there was one case of wound infection after explantation (5% infection rate). One patient was lost to follow up after 6 months.

Subsequent trials of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) and GM-1 have added to the evidence basis that informs the current management practices for acute SCI. The last 50 years have seen a conceptual shift from the pessimism of the past to a cautious optimism that the meager prognosis for neurologic recovery in acute SCI will yield to the progress of medical science. Major advances in the understanding of primary and secondary injury mechanisms have led to the preclinical study of many promising pharmacological therapies, all with the goal of improving neurologic outcome. A few of these drugs have stood the test of animal model experiments and have made it to the forum of human clinical trials. The NASCIS trials of methylprednisolone have been acknowledged widely as the first human studies to claim improved neurologic outcome.

Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of MP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action."

During the study period, 91 cases of spinal cord or spinal column injury were identified, and 30 cases involving a spinal cord injury were identified. Cauda equina injuries were excluded. Seven craniocervical, 12 cervical, 5 thoracic, and 6 thoracolumbar cases were identified. There were 6 cases of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. Eight of the 30 patients received methylprednisolone at the time of admission. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 54 (mean = 19) months. Twenty patients presented with complete injuries (ASIA grade A). Of these, 7 died, 7 had no neurologic recovery, and 6 experienced neurologic improvement. Five of these six eventually became ambulatory with functional gains occurring over a 4- to 50-week period. None of these 5 patients was found to have spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. Of the remaining 10 patients (grades B-D), 8 experienced improvements in neurologic function. Cervical dislocation injuries were associated with a low likelihood of neurologic improvement and atlanto-occipital injuries were associated with early death. Recovery of neurologic function following severe traumatic spinal cord injury occurs with a significantly greater incidence in children than adults, and these improvements can occur over a prolonged postinjury period."

Groups using MP and PNI combined, implant vehicle, and injury with no treatment were also included. Amount of sprouting at the injury sites was significantly different depending on treatment. It was abundant in PNI-treated rats, moderate in rats treated with vehicle or nontreated, and limited in rats given MP with or without PNI (chi2, p=0.0084). This sprouting showed an aberrant course and was located in proliferating tissue at the site of injury, characterized by the presence of ependymal cells, macrophages, and myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells.

Correlation of the amount of sprouting vs. functional outcome or vs. amount of spared tissue was not significant, while correlation of functional outcome vs. amount of spared tissue was significant (p<0.0001).

Recent evidence suggests, however, that immune activity--and specifically autoimmune activity--is evoked by the insult, is beneficial if properly regulated and is amenable to boosting. Thus, for example, vaccination with an altered peptide ligand derived from myelin basic protein reduces the progressive degeneration of neurons that escaped the initial insult, thereby promoting recovery after SCI. As the steroid drug methylprednisolone (MP) is currently the only treatment available for patients with SCI, our purpose in the present study was to examine the mutual compatibility of the two treatments within the post-traumatic therapeutic window. We show, using rats of two different strains, that if MP is injected concomitantly with the therapeutic vaccination, the beneficial effect of the vaccination is diminished. However, if MP is given immediately after the insult and the vaccination 48 h later, MP does not detract from the beneficial effect of the vaccination. These results demonstrate that the therapeutic window after SCI can accommodate immediate administration of MP plus a delayed therapeutic vaccination."

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). Indeed, the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP) has been shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, and to improve neurological recovery in spinal cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI, since it was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy has been obtained. This article explains the process of the discovery, development, and Food and Drug Administration regulation of new drugs for SCI; reviews the past development of MP and tirilazad for acute SCI; identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development; and suggests some promising therapeutic approaches that could either replace or be added to high-dose MP."

The present study was designed to investigate whether continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after MP treatment promotes functional recovery in severe SCI. Contusion injury was produced at the T10 vertebral level of the spinal cord in adult rats. The rats received MP intravenously immediately after the injury and BDNF was infused intrathecally using an osmotic mini-pump for six weeks. Immunohistochemical methods were used to detect ED-1, Growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43), neurofilament (NF), and choline acethyl transferase (ChAT) levels. BDNF did not alter the effect of MP on hematogenous inflammatory cellular infiltration. MP treatment with BDNF infusion resulted in greater axonal survival and regeneration compared to MP treatment alone, as indicated by increases in NF and GAP-43 gene expression. Adjunctive BDNF infusion resulted in better locomotor test scores using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) test.

Searches were carried out on several databases and also on the Internet. Specialist SCI and spinal injury related websites were searched, specifically the Spinal Injuries Association, the British Association of Spinal Cord Injury Specialists and the National Spinal Cord Injury Association. Three separate search strategies were devised to find studies relating to the four key areas. Two reviewers independently screened all study citations for inclusion. The lists of all retrieved studies were scanned for additional studies. Quality of studies was assessed and data were extracted by one reviewer then checked by the second. Data from included studies were summarised within each key area. For dichotomous data, relative risks were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Pooled relative risks were calculated as appropriate. For continuous data, mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and, if data were pooled, weighted mean differences were calculated. Searches were carried out to identify economic evaluations, details of these together with a critical appraisal of quality are presented in structured tables. Quality was assessed using a checklist supplemented with additional comments on the adequacy of methodology where appropriate. For spinal fixation versus no fixation, 68 retrospective observational studies were found that suggested some benefits of fixation surgery. Only four studies were found on fixation surgery in SIUs compared with non-SIU hospitals and no significant differences were seen. All 28 studies concerning delayed referral to a SIU were retrospective observational studies. In most, study details were poorly reported and there was doubt over the comparability of groups at baseline and on confounding factors. Times of referral and transfer were not reported separately. Evidence suggested an effect in favour of the SIU group for neurological improvement. No relevant published studies of any design were found regarding how many people with a new SCI are discharged from hospital without ever being transferred to an SIU. Two systematic reviews were found that assessed the effectiveness of steroids. No studies were identified that considered both costs and the impact on patient outcomes of a given intervention. Although there was evidence to suggest some benefits of fixation surgery and also a benefit of immediate referral to SIUs compared with delayed or no referral, owing to the limitations of the data these should be interpreted with caution. Not enough data were found to assess whether surgery is more beneficial when carried out in SIUs and further research is required in this area. Well-designed prospective observational studies with appropriately matched controls are needed. High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy may be effective in promoting some degree of neurological recovery if given within 8 hours of injury. There is a need for more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological therapy for acute SCI. No published studies of any design were found to answer the question of how many people with acute SCI are discharged from hospital without ever being transferred to an SIU. Primary research involving audit of selected hospital records should be commissioned and published. The search strategy did not identify any full economic evaluations. Future research should include full economic evaluations, possibly alongside a large RCT, which fully consider the costs and consequences of implementing interventions."

This semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic has been reported to inhibit the expression and activity of several mediators of tissue injury, including inflammatory cytokines, free radicals and matrix metalloproteinases, making it a suitable candidate for study. Mice were subjected to extradural compression of the spinal cord using a modified aneurysm clip, following which they received treatment with either minocycline or vehicle beginning 1 h after injury. Behavioural testing of hindlimb function was initiated 3 days after injury using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, and at 1 week using the inclined plane test. Functional assessments demonstrated that minocycline administration significantly improved both hindlimb function and strength from 3 to 28 days after injury compared with vehicle controls. Furthermore, gross lesion size in the spinal cord was significantly reduced by minocycline, and there was evidence of axonal sparing as determined using fluorogold labelling of the rubrospinal tract and by Bielchowsky silver stain. Finally, a comparison of minocycline against the currently approved treatment for acute SCI in humans, methylprednisolone, demonstrated superior behavioural recovery in the minocycline-treated animals."

Today, however, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the development of neuroprotective interventions, and progress toward regenerative interventions are increasing hope for functional restoration. This study addresses the present understanding of SCI, including the etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and scientific advances. The discussion of treatment options includes a critical review of high-dose methylprednisolone and GM-1 ganglioside therapy. The concept that limited rebuilding can provide a disproportionate improvement in quality of life is emphasized throughout. New surgical procedures, pharmacologic treatments, and functional neuromuscular stimulation methods have evolved over the last decades that can improve functional outcomes after spinal cord injury, but limiting secondary injury remains the primary goal. Tissue replacement strategies, including the use of embryonic stem cells, become an important tool and can restore function in animal models. Controlled clinical trials are now required to confirm these observations. The ultimate goal is to harness the body's own potential to replace lost central nervous system cells by activation of endogenous progenitor cell repair mechanisms."

Axonal regeneration was analyzed by counting the number of corticospinal axons, anterogradely labeled with biotin dextran tetramethylrhodamine, caudal to the lesion. Lesioned control rats, receiving either no treatment or vehicle, had abortive axonal regrowth (1 mm) and poor DFR success (38 and 42%, respectively).

Between 1997 and 1998, 22 new cases of ACCSCI-U were identified (15 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 45.9 years (range, 13-75 years). They were all treated nonsurgically. Neurologic impairment, as evaluated by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor and sensory scores, was assessed on patient arrival at the emergency department and followed prospectively at intervals from admission to the 2-year follow-up. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed acutely (1 hours to 2 days after injury), subacutely (3-21 days after injury), and chronically (3-9 months after injury). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the variables that were associated with neurologic improvement. No patient sustained cervical fractures. The mean sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canals (14.8 mm) was smaller than that of normal subjects in Japan. Of these 22 patients, seven (32%) had radiologic evidence of developmental cervical canal stenosis and two (9%) had evidence of ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. Thirteen (59%) had cervical spondylosis: of these, four (31%) had cervical stenosis. Nonsurgical treatment resulted in nearly full neurologic recovery within approximately 6 weeks after the injury. None of the patients went on to need surgery. Their average ASIA score of motor, light touch sensation, and pin sensation was increased from 82.2, 104.5, and 104.3 at admission to 99.3, 111.2, and 111.0, respectively, at 2 years after injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the best predictor associated with a better neurologic recovery of motor, light touch sensation, and pin sensation was the absence of MRI findings of abnormal signal intensity in the spinal cord, with an odds ratio of 64 (P < 0.006), 13 (P < 0.04),and 15 (P < 0.03), respectively. The results also revealed that percent deficit improvement became significant at 1 week after injury to predict neurologic recovery at 2-year follow-up points. In patients with ACCSCI-U, a favorable neurologic prognosis can be predicted following nonsurgical treatment. Most recovery occurred by 6 weeks, and patients with severe initial neurologic damage and old age had poorer recovery. Touch and pin sensation recovered at the same rate, whereas motor recovered more quickly. The absence of abnormal MRI signal intensity in the spinal cord and a good early neurologic improvement were the significant predictors of long-term improvement in neurologic function."

For the NASCIS, Japanese and French trials, additional data (e.g. SDs) have been obtained from the original authors. There are few trials in this area of medical care. Only one steroid has been extensively studied, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, which has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg administered over 15 minutes with a maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial was replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data has been obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This analysis indicates significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy when administration commences within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (for a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status is observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries and a modified regimen found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. High dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacological therapy shown to have efficacy in a Phase Three randomized trial when it can be administered within eight hours of injury. A recent trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. There is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacological therapy for acute spinal cord injury."

This has led to questions concerning the clinical importance of the increase in neurological recovery observed following administration of methylprednisolone (MP) within 8 hours of acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The safety of the therapy has also been questioned. Both neurological and functional recovery were assessed in NASCIS III, a trial that followed an almost identical protocol to NASCIS II. In the current analysis locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) nonparametric regression is used to model the extent of recovery in the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) that is predicted by improvement in the NASCIS/American Spinal Cord Injury Association motor scores that were documented in NASCIS III 1 year after SCI, and the models are applied to the extent of motor recovery demonstrated in NASCIS II. The models predict improvement in FIM that would be expected from the motor function recovery observed in NASCIS II. Estimates are provided overall and for patients with complete and incomplete neurological loss at time of injury. The authors review recent evidence obtained from randomized studies documenting adverse effects that may result from high-dose MP therapy. The relationship between motor function and FIM is strongly nonlinear and dependent on initial level of injury and degree of injury severity. In the best statistical model, the expanded motor score could be used to explain 77.2% of the variability in the FIM. Based on the mean MP-related 3.6-unit improvement in the motor score for patients with complete injuries and 7.3 for those with incomplete injuries owed to MP in NASCIS II, 18.6% of patients would improve six or more FIM points and 9% nine or more points, respectively. In those with complete neurological injury, the mean motor improvement of 3.6 predicted that 63.9% of the patients would improve three or more FIM points and 12.1% six or more points to a maximum of eight points. Of those with incomplete neurological injury, a 7.3 mean improvement in motor function predicted that 27.4% would gain six or more FIM points and that 21% would gain nine or more points to a maximum of 15 points. Analysis of the current best evidence from SCI and other randomized surgical trials in which high-dose MP has been administered provides no grounds for concern about commonly studied adverse effects. The extent of MP therapy-related motor function recovery observed in NASCIS II predicted clinically important recovery in the FIM. Reasons to be cautious with regard to this prediction include the lack of robustness in statistical modeling, some loss of validity in the FIM, and considerable heterogeneity in the SCI population. Whatever functional activity is ascribed to high-dose MP therapy, it is does not appear to be associated with risk of adverse outcomes."

The mechanisms for its beneficial actions are not entirely clear, but experimental evidence suggests MPSS affords some degree of neuroprotection. As many studies with rat models of SCI have been unable to demonstrate improved behavioral outcome or tissue sparing after MPSS treatment, we chose to stereologically assess whether it alters lesion volume and tissue sparing over time, as well as long-term behavioral recovery. Adult rats subjected to contusion SCI with the NYU impactor were administered either MPSS or saline for 24 hr beginning 5 min post injury. Over time the lesion dimensions were extremely dynamic, such that by 6 weeks post injury the volumes were reduced to a third of those seen after the first week. MPSS marginally reduced lesion volumes across time vs. controls, but the amount of spared gray and white matter remained unaltered between the two groups. Behavioral results further showed that MPSS failed to improve recovery of hind-limb function. These findings add to the emerging scrutiny of MPSS as the standard therapy for acute SCI, as well as indicate the existence of a therapeutic window for tissue sparing restricted to the first several days after this type of SCI in rats. Equally important, our results caution the use of lesion volume dimensions or percent tissue sparing at the epicenter as indicators of therapeutic efficacy because neither reflects the actual amount of tissue sparing."

More recent interest has focused on the role of surgical reduction and decompression, particularly ""early"" surgery. A review of the current evidence available in the literature suggests that there is no standard of care regarding the role and timing of surgical decompression. There are insufficient data to support overall treatment standards or guidelines for this topic. There are, however, Class II data indicating that early surgery (<24 hours) may be done safely after acute SCI. Furthermore, there are Class III data to suggest a role for urgent decompression in the setting of 1) bilateral facet dislocation and 2) incomplete spinal cord injury with a neurologically deteriorating patient. Whereas there is biologic evidence from experimental studies in animals that early decompression may improve neurologic recovery after SCI, the relevant time frame in humans remains unclear. To date, the role of decompression in patients with SCI is only supported by Class III and limited Class II evidence and accordingly can be considered only a practice option. Accordingly, there is a strong rationale to undertake prospective, controlled trials to evaluate the role and timing of decompression in acute SCI."

Furthermore, they were mixtures of differing distributions from different study strata, so that overall conclusions depend on the mixture of patients seen. The prognosis of these patients with spinal cord injury seen at 28 centers in North America during the mid-1990s appears better than was often assumed earlier. The general patterns are similar across different measurement scales, although there are intriguing differences. The patterns in different strata are different in specifics, and complete injuries do less well.

Seventy-five percent of the delegates answered that they used or recommended methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Nevertheless, the delegates had an average of 1.5 reservations about administering methylprednisolone. The most common reservation was that they did not think the improvement conferred to the patients by administering methylprednisolone had been clinically or functionally proven. There were reservations about the validity of the statistical analysis used in the NASCIS studies and by the omission of a placebo group in NASCIS III. The majority of the delegates thought it was not medicolegally negligent to withhold the administration of methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury.

Pharmacologic strategies focus on the control of secondary injury processes, primarily lipid peroxidation (LP), and the salvage of as much white matter as possible. The first effective neuroprotective agent was methylprednisolone (MP), a glucocorticosteroid that in high doses improves neurological recovery in animals and humans following acute SCI. Tirilazad is a more targeted non-glucocorticoid LP inhibitor that has been shown to be neuroprotective and has fewer side effects than MP. Future SCI therapy is likely to encompass various neuroprotective agents, including inhibitors of LP, inhibitors of the nitric oxide-derived reactive oxygen species peroxynitrite, inhibitors of calpain (which is responsible for degrading the spinal cord cytoskeleton), and inhibitors of post-traumatic apoptosis of neurons and myelin-forming oligodendroglia.

The level of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA increased from 6 h after SCI and reached a maximum after 48 h. NT-3 mRNA level was enhanced by PC-SOD treatment, but not by MP treatment. Thus, the effect of MP in suppressing these pro-inflammatory genes expression was more than that of PC-SOD. The difference in motor function in the early and later stage may be partially due to differences in expression of IL-1beta and NT-3 after either treatment, through an IL-1beta-dependent or NT-3-mediated repair response."

Histologically the injury site was scored in four groups and immunohistochemically Wallerian Degeneration (WD), astrocytosis and expression of beta-amyloid protein was identified. In examining the IP data, no significant difference was recognized between the group means (P-value>0.5). For the TSR, there were no differences in the group responses. For the TS, the differences were not statistically significant.

The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy."

NASCIS II was initially reported by National Institutes of Health announcements, National Institutes of Health facsimiles to emergency room physicians, and the news media. The subsequent report in the New England Journal of Medicine implied that there was a positive result in the primary efficacy analysis for the entire 487 patient sample. However, this analysis was in fact negative, and the positive result was found only in a secondary analysis of the subgroup of patients who received treatment within 8 hours. In addition, that subgroup apparently had only 62 patients taking methylprednisolone and 67 receiving placebo. The NASCIS II and III reports embody specific choices of statistical methods that have strongly shaped the reporting of results but have not been adequately challenged or or even explained. These studies show statistical artifacts that call their results into question. In NASCIS II, the placebo group treated before 8 hours did poorly, not only when compared with the methylprednisolone group treated before 8 hours but even when compared with the placebo group treated after 8 hours. Thus, the positive result may have been caused by a weakness in the control group rather than any strength of methylprednisolone. In NASCIS III, a randomization imbalance occurred that allocated a disproportionate number of patients with no motor deficit (and therefore no chance for recovery) to the lower dose control group. When this imbalance is controlled for, much of the superiority of the higher dose group seems to disappear. The NASCIS group's decision to admit persons with minor SCIs with minimal or no motor deficit not only enables statistical artifacts it complicates the interpretation of results from the population actually sampled. Perhaps one half of the NASCIS III sample may have had at most a minor deficit. Thus, we do not know whether the results of these studies reflect the severely injured population to which they have been applied. The numbers, tables, and figures in the published reports are scant and are inconsistently defined, making it impossible even for professional statisticians to duplicate the analyses, to guess the effect of changes in assumptions, or to supply the missing parts of the picture. Nonetheless, even 9 years after NASCIS II, the primary data have not been made public. The reporting of the NASCIS studies has fallen far short of the guidelines of the ICH/FDA and of the Evidence-based Medicine Group. Despite the lucrative ""off label"" markets for methylprednisolone in SCI, no Food and Drug Association indication has been obtained. There has been no public process of validation. These shortcomings have denied physicians the chance to use confidently a drug that many were enthusiastic about and has left them in an intolerably ambiguous position in their therapeutic choices, in their legal exposure, and in their ability to perform further research to help their patients."

This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between 3 to 8 hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries and a modified regimen found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. High dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacological therapy shown to have efficacy in a Phase Three randomized trial when it can be administered within 8 hours of injury. High dose methylprednisolone has been accepted as standard therapy in many countries.

The melanocortin melanotropin is known to improve axonal regeneration following sciatic nerve injury, and to stimulate corticospinal outgrowth after partial spinal cord transection. Recently, we showed that intrathecally administered alphaMSH had beneficial effects on functional recovery after experimental SCI. Since both drugs have shown their value in intervention studies after (experimental) spinal cord injury (ESCI), we decided to study the effects of combined treatment. Our results again showed that alphaMSH enhances functional recovery after ESCI in the rat and that MP, although not affecting functional recovery adversely by itself, abolished the effects observed with alphaMSH when combined.

The current standard of care is to administer MP as a bolus of 30 mg/kg followed by a 23-h infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h to spinal cord injured patients. To better understand the role of MP in neuroprotection, we have studied how MP administration affects macrophage accumulation, tissue loss, and axonal dieback at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after a complete transection of the eighth thoracic spinal cord in the adult rat. A 30 mg/kg dose of MP was administered intravenously at 5 min, and 2 and 4 h after injury. The number of ED1 (antibody against microglia/macrophages) -positive cells was quantified in a 500-micrometer-wide strip of tissue directly adjacent and parallel to the transection. At all time points, MP treatment led to a significant decrease in the number of ED1-positive cells in both rostral and caudal stumps. Over the 2-month post-transection period, the average MP-induced reduction in the number of ED1-positive cells was 82% in the rostral cord stump and 66% in the caudal stump. Using a computerized image analysis system, it was observed that MP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tissue loss in both cord stumps at 2, 4 and 8 week post-injury. Over the 2-month post-lesion period, the average MP-induced reduction in tissue loss in the caudal cord stump was higher than that in the rostral stump; 48 versus 37%, respectively. Immunostaining for neurofilaments and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) revealed the presence of numerous axons near and in the lesion site. Anterograde neuronal tracing with biotinylated dextran amine showed that, in MP-treated animals, dieback of vestibulospinal fibres, but not of corticospinal fibres, was significantly diminished at all time points studied. In addition, with MP administration, 1 and 2 weeks after injury, an increase in the number of vestibulospinal fibres was found at 1 and 2 mm from the transection, suggesting transient regenerative sprouting of these fibres. The results demonstrate that treatment with MP shortly after spinal cord transection in the adult rat led to a long-term reduction of ED1-positive cells and spinal tissue loss, reduced dieback of vestibulospinal fibres, and a transient sprouting of vestibulospinal fibres near the lesion at 1 and 2 weeks post-lesion. The possible relationships between the inflammatory changes, spinal tissue sparing, and axonal survival and sprouting are complex and need to be further explored."

Recent efforts have focused on understanding the biochemical basis of secondary injury and developing pharmacologic agents to intervene in the progression of neurologic deterioration. The Third National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study investigators concluded that methylprednisolone improves neurologic recovery after acute spinal cord injury and recommended that patients who receive methylprednisolone within 3 hours of injury should be maintained on the treatment regimen for 24 hours. When methylprednisolone therapy is initiated 3 to 8 hours after injury, it should continue for 48 hours.

Whereas the primary injury is fated by the circumstances of the trauma, the outcome of the secondary injury may be amenable to therapeutic modulation. This article reviews the pathogenetic determinants of these two phases of injury and summarizes the pharmacological manipulations that may restore neurological function after SCI. Experimental models of SCI and their inherent limitations in simulating human SCI are surveyed. The pathogenesis of primary and secondary injury, as well as the theoretical bases of neurological recovery, are examined in detail. The effects of glucocorticoids, lazeroids, gangliosides, opiate antagonists, calcium channel blockers, glutamate receptor antagonists, antioxidants, free radical scavengers, and other pharmacological agents in both animal models and human trials are summarized. Practical limitations to inducing neural regeneration are also addressed. The molecular events that mediate the pathogenesis of SCI are logical targets for pharmacological manipulation and include glutamate accumulation, aberrant calcium fluxes, free radical formation, lipid peroxidation, and generation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Enhancement of neural regeneration and plasticity comprise other possible strategies. Pharmacological agents must be given within a narrow window of opportunity to be effective.

Neurotrophins play important roles in normal development of central and peripheral nervous system. It is reported that traumatic insults to the brain alter the expression of these neurotrophins. These responses are considered to trigger a cascade of cellular protection and repair. First, we investigated the temporal and spatial expression patterns of neurotrophin and IL-1 beta mRNAs in the area of spinal cord lesion. Second, we examined if methylprednisolone (MP) affects the expression of these genes in SCI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 gms) were laminectomized at T10. Spinal cord was crushed by clipping (holding force 60 gms, 1 sec). Rats were killed at 1, 6, 12, 24 h, and 72 h after the injury and the spinal cord was rapidly removed and frozen sections were cut. Second, the other group of rats were treated with MP (165 mg/kg) just after SCI and sacrificed at 6 h. The levels of neurotrophins and IL-1 beta mRNAs were evaluated by in situ hybridization histochemistry. IL-1 beta mRNA level was elevated at 1 h and 6 h and attenuated at 12 h. The increased level of BDNF and NT3 mRNAs were first observed at 6 h and the labeling was enhanced at 24 h and 72 h. In MP treated group, the levels of IL-1 beta, BDNF and NT3 mRNAs were attenuated compared with those of MP-untreated SCI group. Steroid hormone therapy diminishes the post-traumatic inflammatory cascades which produce edema and swelling and worsen neuronal injury. However, glucocorticoid may hinder the endogenous repair mechanism.

Recently agreed upon international standards establish a uniform neurologic classification to measure clinical outcomes. They are currently in use in three multicenter studies in more than 40 SCI centers in the United States. The Model System SCI centers report the use of these measures, such as impairment grades and neurologic levels, in almost 15,000 cases over the past 20 years and, more recently, motor scores in 3,500 patients. The NASCIS II multicenter trial on methylprednisolone used motor and sensory scores as endpoints in close to 500 patients, but have incorporated the international standards, which include a disability measure, in NASCIS III. The study of ganglioside effectiveness also is using these measures in many patients. In more focused studies, neurologic assessment soon after injury can predict walking in motor complete injuries based on pin prick sensation, and in motor incomplete injuries based on impairment grade and age. Eventual upper extremity function can be estimated based on the motor examination within 72 hours of injury. Both the motor score and motor level are more reliable in predicting upper extremity function than the single sensory level. This presumably reflects the greater importance of motor recovery on functional outcome. The proximal muscles of the lower extremities caudal to the lesion site recover before distal muscles, and this may be mediated by axons descending in the ventral tracts, which control primarily proximal rather than distal muscles. These axons may be preferentially spared and/or have greater capacity to compensate than those present in the lateral columns. In conclusion, standard neurologic assessment in SCI is extremely valuable in monitoring recovery in order to prognosticate functional outcome, evaluate effectiveness of drug interventions, and provide valuable clues to possible underlying mechanisms of recovery. The elucidation of these mechanisms will aid in the refinement of current treatments and development of new strategies to enhance neurologic recovery and functional outcome."

In conclusion, we suggest that it seems unlikely that any single intervention strategy will be sufficient to ensure regeneration of damaged pathways and recovery of function after SCI. Clearly, work from a number of laboratories indicates that the dogma that mature CNS neurons are inherently incapable of regeneration of axons after injury is no longer tenable. The issue, rather, is to identify and reverse the conditions that limit regeneration after SCI. After SCI, a hierarchy of ""intervention-strategies"" may be required to restore suprasegmental control leading to recovery of function. The hierarchy may be both temporal and absolute. For example, early interventions (such as the administration of methylprednisolone within hours of the injury) may be required to interrupt the secondary injury cascade and restrict the extent of damage after SCI. At the injury site itself, interventions to minimize the secondary injury effects may be followed by interventions to alter the environment at the site of injury to provide a terrain conducive to axonal elongation. For example, one might envision strategies to downregulate the expression of molecules that limit growth and upregulate the expression of those that support growth. Early after the injury, axotomized neurons may require neurotrophic support either for their survival or to initiate and maintain a cell body response supporting axonal elongation. There may be an absolute hierarchy as well. Particular populations of neurons may have very specific requirements for regenerative growth. For example, the conditions that enhance the regenerative growth of descending motor pathways may differ from those required by ascending sensory systems. One may also want to design strategies to restrict the plasticity of some pathways (e.g., nociceptive) and enhance the growth in other pathways. The demands on the CNS for anatomic reorganization after SCI may be far less formidable than one might at first imagine. If one assumes that recovery of function will require regenerative growth of large numbers of axons over long distances in a point-to-point topographically specific fashion, the idea of recovery of function becomes daunting. On the other hand, it has been shown in many studies and in many areas of the CNS that as little as 10% of a particular pathway can often subserve substantial function. Furthermore, regrowth over relatively short distances can have major functional consequences. For example, relatively modest changes in the level of SCI can have relatively profound effects on the functional consequences of injury. This is particularly true in cervical SCI: an individual with a C5/6 SCI is dramatically more impaired than one with C7/8 injury. One might envision relatively short distance growth across the injury site to re-establish suprasegmental control. Coupled with strategies to enhance the anatomic and functional reorganization of spinal cord circuitry caudal to the level of the injury, even modest long distance growth may have sufficient functional impact. One might imagine the ability to learn to ""use"" even modest quantities of novel inputs in functionally useful, appropriate ways."

In two independent randomized blinded experiments, treatment with either alpha MSH (75 micrograms/kg of body weight administered subcutaneously every 48 h for 3 weeks after trauma) or single high-dose (30 mg/kg, 30 min after injury) methylprednisolone was compared with saline treatment in rats subjected to a moderately severe 20-gcm weight drop injury. Spinal cord function was monitored using behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological parameters. In both experiments, alpha MSH significantly improved recovery, as illustrated by Tarlov scores, thoracolumbar height, and amplitude of rubrospinal motor evoked potentials. The magnitude of the alpha MSH effect on motor performance was comparable with the one observed after treatment with methylprednisolone. The reproducible neurological and electrophysiological improvement in spinal cord function of animals treated with alpha MSH suggests a new lead in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury."

The rationale for this regimen has been based upon the need for high doses (i.e., 30 mg/kg initial IV dose) to inhibit posttraumatic lipid peroxidation (LP) in the injured spinal segment. However, injury also triggers the immediate calcium-mediated activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the release of arachidonic acid, and the enzymatic formation of potentially deleterious prostaglandins (PGE2 alpha, PGE2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and leukotrienes (LTs). Thus, in view of the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated inhibition of PLA2 that underlies much of MP's antiinflammatory actions, an additional neuroprotective mechanism may relate to an inhibition of eicosanoid formation. Using the cat spinal cord compression model (180g x 5 min at L3; Na pentobarbitol anesthesia), we examined whether 30 min postinjury dosing with MP (30 mg/kg IV) could attenuate spinal tissue eicosanoid levels measured by enzyme immunoassay at 1 h (Experiment 1). Pial blood flow was measured over the dorsal columns at the injury site using laser doppler flowmetry to monitor posttraumatic hyperperfusion as an index of the microvascular pathophysiology of acute SCI. In vehicle treated animals at 1 h postinjury, there was a significant increase in the tissue levels of PGF2 alpha (+290%), PGE2 (+260%), TXB2 (stable analog of TXA2, +126%), and LTB4 (+73%) in comparison to sham, uninjured animals. However, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (stable analog of prostacyclin or PGI2) and LTC4 did not increase. Methylprednisolone did not reduce the increase in eicosanoid production. In the case of LTB4 and LTC4, MP actually increased the levels further. In addition, we examined the effects of a double dose MP regimen (30 mg/kg IV at 30 min plus 15 mg/kg IV at 2.5 h postinjury) on spinal cord eicosanoid levels at 4 h postinjury (Experiment 2). At 4 h postinjury, significant increases in PGF2 alpha, PGE2, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were observed, and with the exception of PGE2, no MP attenuation of the increased eicosanoids was seen. These results fail to provide evidence that postinjury administration of high dose MP exerts a significant anti-PLA2 action. On the other hand, MP effectively inhibited secondary spinal cord pial hyperperfusion, which is believed to be largely mediated by free radical-lipid peroxidative mechanisms. Thus, it seems likely that the protective action of MP on the acute microvascular pathophysiology of SCI is mediated by its well-documented effects on posttraumatic LP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Glucocorticosteroids were first used in patients with acute spinal cord injury in the 1960s.

The true benefit of steroid therapy is unclear because of the difference in outcome of the two placebo groups who entered the protocol before and after 8 hours.

However, until the raw patient data from NASCIS II is made available for independent review, the actual benefit of intensive steroid therapy will remain elusive. Even with the controversies and unresolved issues, we advocate initiation of intensive glucocorticosteroid therapy as soon as possible after acute spinal cord injury, and not beyond the first 8 hours. There is too much data available to arrive at any other conclusion."

Because GM1 may have additive or synergistic effects when used with MP, the authors compared MP, GM1, and MP+GM1 treatments in a graded rat spinal cord contusion model. Spinal cord injury was caused by dropping a rod weighing 10 gm from a height of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 cm onto the rat spinal cord at T-10, which had been exposed via laminectomy. The lesion volumes were quantified from spinal cord Na and K shifts at 24 hours after injury and the results were verified histologically in separate experiments. A single dose of MP (30 mg/kg), given 5 minutes after injury, reduced 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes by 56% (p = 0.0052), 28% (p = 0.0065), and 13% (p > 0.05) in the three injury-severity groups, respectively, compared to similarly injured control groups treated with vehicle only. Methylprednisolone also prevented injury-induced hyponatremia and increased body weight loss in the spine-injured rats. When used alone, GM1 (10 to 30 mg/kg) had little or no effect on any measured variable compared to vehicle controls; when given concomitantly with MP, GM1 blocked the neuroprotective effects of MP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, GM1 partially prevented MP-induced reductions in lesion volumes, while 10 to 30 mg/kg of GM1 completely blocked these effects of MP. The effects of MP on injury-induced hyponatremia and body weight loss were also blocked by GM1. Thus, GM1 antagonized both central and peripheral effects of MP in spine-injured rats. Until this interaction is clarified, the authors recommend that MP and GM1 not be used concomitantly to treat acute human spinal cord injury. Because GM1 modulates protein kinase activity, protein kinases inhibit lipocortins, and lipocortins mediate anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, it is proposed that the neuroprotective effects of MP are partially due to anti-inflammatory effects and that GM1 antagonizes the effects of MP by inhibiting lipocortin. Possible beneficial effects of GM1 reported in central nervous system injury may be related to the effects on neural recovery rather than acute injury processes."

Methylprednisolone treatment administered early following injury has been found to improve recovery below the lesion in patients initially diagnosed as having complete or incomplete injuries; it also leads to greater (but still relatively small) improvement in the injury level. The analysis indicates that delayed treatment with methylprednisolone is associated with decreased neurological recovery.

Although much work remains, four criteria that are logically required to establish the pathophysiological importance of oxygen radical reactions have been met, at least in part. First of all, oxygen radical generation and lipid peroxidation appear to be early biochemical events subsequent to CNS trauma. Second, a growing body of direct or circumstantial evidence suggests that oxygen radical formation and lipid peroxidation are linked to pathophysiological processes such as hypoperfusion, edema, axonal conduction failure, failure of energy metabolism, and anterograde (wallerian) degeneration. Third, there is a striking similarity between the pathology of blunt mechanical injury to CNS tissue and that produced by chemical induction of peroxidative injury. Fourth, and most convincing, is the repeated observation that compounds that inhibit lipid peroxidation or scavenge oxygen radicals can block posttraumatic pathophysiology and promote functional recovery and survival in experimental studies. Nevertheless, the significance of oxygen radicals and lipid peroxidation ultimately depends on whether it can be demonstrated that early application of effective antifree radical or antiperoxidative agents can promote survival and neurological recovery after CNS injury and stroke in humans. The results of the NASCIS II clinical trial, which have shown that an antioxidant dosing regimen with methylprednisolone begun within 8 hr after spinal cord injury can significantly enhance chronic neurological recovery, strongly supports the significance of lipid peroxidation as a posttraumatic degenerative mechanism. However, ongoing Phase III trials with the more selective and effective antioxidant U74006F (tirilazad mesylate) will give a more clear-cut answer as to the therapeutic importance of inhibition of posttraumatic free radical reactions in the injured CNS."

The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds further supports the concept that LP is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacological neuroprotection."

The study showed that patients who received the drug within 8 hr after injury improved, whereas those who received the drug later did not. The drug significantly increased recovery even in severely injured patients who were admitted with no motor or sensory function below the lesion, contradicting a long-held dogma that such patients would not recover. Some researchers, however, have questioned the stratification of the patient population, the use of summed neurologic change scores, and the absence of functional assessments. The stratification by injury severity and treatment time was planned a priori and based on objective criteria. Detailed analyses revealed no differences between groups attributable to stratification or randomization. While multivariate analyses of the summed neurologic scores were used, the conclusions were corroborated by other analytical approaches that did not rely on summed scores. For example, treatment with methylprednisolone more than doubled the probability that patients would convert from quadriplegia or paraplegia to quadriparesis or paraparesis, analgesia to hypalgesia, and anesthesia to hypesthesia. The treatment also significantly improved neurologic scores in lumbosacral segments, indicating that beneficial effects were not limited to segments close to the lesion site. The treatment did not significantly affect mortality or morbidity. The study strongly suggests that methylprednisolone has significant beneficial effects in human spinal cord injury, that these effects occur only when the drug is given within 8 hr, and that it helps even in patients with severe spinal cord injuries. These conclusions have important implications for spinal cord injury care and research."

The recent National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) showed that very high dose methylprednisolone given within 8 hr after injury improves neurologic recovery. The mechanism is believed to be inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Many other drugs have been claimed to be beneficial in animal studies, including other lipid peroxidation inhibitors, free radical scavengers, opiate receptor blockers, NMDA receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, and protease inhibitors. In chronic spinal cord injury, much progress also has been made. Myelin was found to possess factors that inhibit axonal regeneration. Blocking these factors enhances spinal cord regeneration. Monosialic gangliosides (GM1) were recently found to improve neurologic recovery in spinal-cord-injured patients. Given as late as 48-72 hr after injury, the mechanism of action is not well understood. However, the GM1 results give hope that recovery mechanisms can be manipulated pharmacologically. Nonregenerative therapy for chronic spinal cord injury is also being developed. Several drugs, including 4-aminopyridine and baclofen, respectively blockers of potassium channels and GABA-B receptors, improve conduction in demyelinated axons. These drugs may be useful for identifying patients who might benefit from remyelination therapy. Finally, NASCIS has complicated acute spinal cord injury studies. To bring a drug to clinical trial, an investigator must now determine the optimal treatment dose, timing, and duration over a range of injury severities, in comparison and combination with methylprednisolone. This requirement has so increased the scale of drug testing that multicenter laboratory trials may be necessary."

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacologic agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger alpha tocopherol (i.e., vitamin E) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurologic recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for the treatment of acute neural injury. The glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant dosages, improves chronic neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of methylprednisolone is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions. Novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids have been developed that are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than methylprednisolone.

The delayed decline of evoked potentials and blood flow suggest secondary injury processes that may respond to pharmacological therapy. High dose methylprednisolone (15-30 mg/kg) dramatically improved blood flow, extracellular ionic shifts, blood flow, and evoked potentials in cat spinal cords. Methylprednisolone also decreased tissue ionic shifts and improved locomotory recovery.

Treatment of spinal cord-injured cats with high doses of MP promoted or spared locomotor function and preserved spinal cord tissue. Extending these findings in cats to humans, it was recently demonstrated that high doses of MP administered within 8 h of injury significantly improved neurologic recovery in human spinal cord-injured patients. The compound U74006F is one of a series of 21-aminosteroids that, unlike MP, lack glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid or other hormonal activity yet are potent inhibitors of lipid perioxidation. Over a 100-fold range of doses, U74006F promoted recovery of locomotor function in spinal cord-injured cats. The lowest effective dose for U74006F was 100 times lower than the maximally effective dose for MP. The efficacy of U74006F is unchanged if treatment is initiated within 4 h of injury. However, if treatment is delayed for 8 h, the therapeutic potency of U74006F is substantially reduced.

A growing body of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological evidence has suggested that oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, working in concert with aberrant calcium fluxes and eicosanoid generation in particular, plays a key role in progressive post-traumatic spinal cord degeneration. Of particular importance, lipid peroxidation has been linked to microvascular damage and hypoperfusion which, if severe enough, can lead to a secondary ischemic insult to the tissue. The ability of intensive dosing with the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone to beneficially affect post-traumatic ischemia and to promote chronic neurologic recovery in spinal cord injured animals has been correlated not with its glucocorticoid activity, but rather with the ability to inhibit post-traumatic spinal lipid peroxidation. In view of this, a novel series of non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroids has been developed which lack glucocorticoid activity but are more effective inhibitors of nervous tissue lipid peroxidation than the glucocorticoid steroids. One of these, U74006F, has now been studied in some detail and appears to be a promising new agent for the acute treatment of spinal cord (and brain) trauma.

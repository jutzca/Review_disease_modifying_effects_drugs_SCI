He underwent anterior corpectomy, decompression, fusion of C6-T1 vertebrae, and halo placement. The American Spinal Injury Association grade of his spinal cord injury (SCI) was C6 C tetraplegia. Severe orthostatic hypotension in the upright position complicated the patient's rehabilitation program. Midodrine was prescribed, and other medications with possible adverse effects were adjusted. Significant improvement after taking midodrine was reflected in the orthostatic vital signs and symptoms, as well as in FIM instrument scores. Staff noted improvements with therapy participation and functional status. The patient tolerated the midodrine well and had no significant side effects."

Using an aneurysm mini-clip model of contusive SCI, T9-10 laminectomies were performed for 60 male rats. Animals were divided into six experimental groups (n = 10 per group) as follows: a minocycline administered positive control group, a saline-vehicle negative control group, a sham-operated group, and three experimental groups which received separate doses of sumatriptan (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg). Behavioural assessments were used to evaluate locomotor activity and neuropathic pain for 28 days. At the end of the study, spinal cord tissues were collected from sacrificed animals for histopathological analysis. Levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and two pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α and interleukin [IL]-1β) were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sumatriptan significantly (P < 0.001) improved the locomotor activity in SCI group. Sumatriptan was also more effective than the positive control, i.e. minocycline (0.3 mg/kg). Additionally, sumatriptan and minocycline similarly attenuated the mechanical and thermal allodynia in SCI (P < 0.001). TNF-α, IL-1β and CGRP levels in sumatriptan- and minocycline-treated groups significantly (P < 0.001) decreased compared to controls. Histopathological analysis also revealed a markedly improvement in hemorrhage followed by inflammatory cell invasion, neuronal vacuolation, and cyst formation in both sumatriptan- and minocycline-treated groups compared to control animals. Sumatriptan improves functional recovery from SCI through its anti-inflammatory effects and reducing pro-inflammatory and pain mediators."

Following SCI pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase at the lesion site and play important roles in secondary tissue damage. Methylprednisolone (MP) is a glucocorticoid, and minocycline is a tetracycline-derived antibiotic both with neuroprotective effects on central nervous system trauma. However, there are limited studies on their effects on SCI. In this study, we aimed to evaluate effects of MP+minocycline combined treatment on cellular distribution and localization of TNF-α And IL-6 after SCI. Eighty Wistar rats were divided into three main groups as the intact control group, sham operation group, and experimental control group that received spinal cord compression injury. Following the injury, the experimental control group was subdivided into four groups as control, methylprednisolone treatment, minocycline treatment and, MP+minocycline combined treatment groups. Tissue samples were obtained from all groups at 24 hours and 72 hours after the injury. We found a significant decrease in TNF-α And IL-6 expressions in combined treatment group at 24 hours after injury. Also, there was a significant decrease in MDA and increase in SOD levels in this group. Furthermore, decreased lipid peroxidation and neuronal and glial cell death were also observed in combined treatment group. These results suggest that MP+minocycline combined treatment promotes functional recovery and, it should be considered as an effective treatment protocol following SCI."

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of minocycline, a promising agent for post-injury treatment, prophylactic administration. In a rat model of SCI through contusion injury, T9 vertebra laminectomy was performed on 40 Sprague-Dawley male rats provided from Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). The reason behind selecting only male rats in our study was the fact that menstrual cycle of female rats affects healing process. Rodents were divided into a sham-operated group, a control group receiving only saline, a minocycline-treated group, and a minocycline pretreated group. Locomotor scaling, behavioral tests for neuropathic pain, and weight changes were evaluated and compared through a 28-days period. At the end of the study, tissue samples were taken to assess neuroinflammatory cytokine and histopathological changes. Minocycline pretreatment was as effective as its post-SCI administration regarding locomotor activity recovery, mechanical pain, and thermal allodynia. Furthermore, spinal cord inflammation and histopathological alterations were both similar in pretreatment and treatment groups indicating substantially better status. None of the treatments could have completely restore or prevent the spinal cord damage. Minocycline pretreatment can show promising therapeutic effects similar to its post-injury administration, inhibiting inflammatory microglial activity."

Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations."

We validated our screening platform by showing that Riluzole and Minocycline, two molecules that are in clinical trials for SCI, promote rescue of the locomotor function of the transected larvae. Further validation of the platform was obtained through the blind identification of D-Cycloserine, a molecule scheduled to enter phase IV clinical trials for SCI.

Treatment of SCI still remains a tremendous challenge clinically. Minocycline could target comprehensive secondary injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a known sealing agent, is able to seal the damaged cell membranes and reduce calcium influx, thereby exerting neuroprotective capacity. Here, an E-selectin-targeting sialic acid - polyethylene glycol - poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SAPP) copolymer was designed for delivering hydrophobic minocycline to achieve combinational therapy of SCI. The obtained SAPP copolymer could self-assemble into micelles with critical micelle concentration being of 13.40 μg/mL, and effectively encapsulate hydrophobic minocycline. The prepared drug-loaded micelles (SAPPM) displayed sustained drug release over 72 h, which could stop microglia activation and exhibited excellent neuroprotective capacity in vitro. The SAPP micelles were efficiently accumulated in the lesion site of SCI rats via the specific binding between sialic acid and E-selectin. Due to the targeting distribution and combinational effect between PEG and minocycline, SAPPM could obviously reduce the area of lesion cavity, and realize more survival of axons and myelin sheaths from the injury, thus distinctly improving hindlimb functional recovery of SCI rats and conferring superior therapeutic effect in coparison with other groups. Our work presented an effective and safe strategy for SCI targeting therapy. Besides, neuroprotective capacity of PEG deserves further investigation on other central nervous system diseases."

However, MH is only neuroprotective at high concentrations that cannot be achieved by systemic administration, which limits its clinical efficacy. We have developed a hydrogel-based MH delivery system that can be injected into the intrathecal space for local delivery of high concentrations of MH, without damaging spinal cord tissue. Implantation of MH hydrogel after unilateral level-C4/5 contusion SCI robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by in vivo recordings of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and electromyography (EMG) amplitudes. MH hydrogel also decreased lesion size and degeneration of cervical motor neuron somata, demonstrating its central neuroprotective effects within the injured cervical spinal cord. Furthermore, MH hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by the axons of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by both detailed neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from the diaphragm using cholera toxin B (CTB). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that local MH hydrogel delivery to the injured cervical spinal cord is effective in preserving respiratory function after SCI by protecting the important neural circuitry that controls diaphragm activation."

In this experimental study, adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. Rats received an intraperitoneal injection of minocycline immediately after SCI, and then 24 hours after the injury. Transplantations were performed 7 days after the injury. Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale (BBB). After that, the animals were sacrificed, and T11 segment of the spinal cord was removed after 5 weeks, and then used for histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical assessments. Western blot analysis was applied to determine the protein expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL1β) and caspase3. The results of this study showed that the combination of OECs graft and minocycline reduced the functional deficits and diminished cavitation and astrogliosis in spinal tissue. The analysis of protein expression by western blotting revealed that minocycline treatment along with OECs transplantation further decreased the level of IL-1β, TNF-α, caspase-3, and the oxidative stress as compared with when minocycline or OECs transplantation was used alone. The combinatory treatment with OECs graft and minocycline induced a more effective response to the repair of spinal cord injury, and it is considered a therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCI."

Spinally-injured patients receive opioids within hours of arrival at the emergency room, and prolonged opioid regimens are often employed for the management of post-SCI chronic pain. However, previous studies in our laboratory suggest that the effects of opioids such as morphine may be altered in the pathophysiological context of neurotrauma. Specifically, we have shown that morphine administration in a rodent model of SCI increases mortality and tissue loss at the injury site, and decreases recovery of motor and sensory function, and overall health, even weeks after treatment. The literature suggests that opioids may produce these adverse effects by acting as endotoxins and increasing glial activation and inflammation. To better understand the effects of morphine following SCI, in this study we used flow cytometry to assess immune-competent cells at the lesion site. We observed a morphine-induced increase in the overall number of CD11b+ cells, with marked effects on microglia, in SCI subjects. Next, to investigate whether this increase in the inflammatory profile is necessary to produce morphine's effects, we challenged morphine treatment with minocycline. We found that pre-treatment with minocycline reduced the morphine-induced increase in microglia at the lesion site. More importantly, minocycline also blocked the adverse effects of morphine on recovery of function without disrupting the analgesic efficacy of this opioid. Together, our findings suggest that following SCI, morphine may exacerbate the inflammatory response, increasing cell death at the lesion site and negatively affecting functional recovery."

Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority.

Inhibitory factors in the lesion scar and poor intrinsic neural regeneration capacity restrict functional recovery after injury. Minocycline, which has neuroprotective activity, can alleviate secondary injury, but the long-term administration of this drug may cause toxicity. Polysialic acid (PSA) is a large cell-surface carbohydrate that is critical for central nervous system development and is capable of promoting precursor cell migration, axon path finding, and synaptic remodeling; thus, PSA plays a vital role in tissue repair and regeneration. Here, we developed a PSA-based minocycline-loaded nanodrug delivery system (PSM) for the synergistic therapy of spinal cord injury. The prepared PSM exerted marked anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities both in vitro and in vivo. The administration of PSM could significantly protect neurons and myelin sheaths from damage, reduce the formation of glial scar, recruit endogenous neural stem cells to the lesion site, and promote the regeneration of neurons and the extension of long axons throughout the glial scar, thereby largely improving the locomotor function of SCI rats and exerting a superior therapeutic effect.

Minocycline, a clinically available antibiotic agent with anti-inflammatory properties, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects in a variety of animal models and improved motor recovery in a Phase-2 human trial. Here, we leveraged our recently developed T3 severe contusion model in the rat to determine the ability of minocycline to preserve descending sympathoexcitatory axons and improve cardiovascular control after SCI. Forty-one male Wistar rats were randomized to either a treatment group (minocycline; n = 20) or a control group (vehicle; n = 21). All rats received a severe T3 contusion.

Neuroanatomical correlates (lesion area, descending sympathoexcitatory axons) were assessed, in addition to an assessment of cardiovascular control (hemodynamics, autonomic dysreflexia) and motor behavior. Here, we show that minocycline reduces lesion area, increases the number of descending sympathoexctitatory axons traversing the injury site, and ultimately reduces the severity of autonomic dysreflexia. Finally, we show that autonomic dysreflexia is a more sensitive marker of treatment stratification than motor function."

Animals were divided into a SHAM-operated group and five treatment groups. The treatments included normal saline as a vehicle control group, minocycline 90 mg/kg and metformin at the doses of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg. Locomotor scaling, behavioral tests for neuropathic pain and weight changes were evaluated and compared through a 28-days period.

Metformin 50 mg/kg improved the locomotors ability (p < 0.001) and decreased sensitivity to mechanical and thermal allodynia (p < 0.01). These results were compatible with minocycline effect on SCI (p > 0.05). While metformin led to weight loss, both metformin and minocycline significantly decreased neuroinflammation in the assessment of cord tissue histopathology, and levels of TNF-α and interleukin-1β (p < 0.001). Metformin could be considered as an alternative therapeutic agent for SCI, as it potentially attenuates neuroinflammation, sensory and locomotor complications of cord injury."

The secondary injury mechanisms that MH can potentially target include inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, ischemia, hemorrhage, and edema. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of the multifaceted actions of MH. Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are partially achieved through conserved mechanisms such as modulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways as well as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Additionally, MH can directly inhibit calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mitochondrial calcium uptake, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzymatic activity, and iron toxicity. It can also directly scavenge free radicals. Because it can target many secondary injury mechanisms, MH treatment holds great promise for reducing tissue damage and promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury."

Surgical management has been growing in popularity over the years and remains an option as it helps reduce spinal cord compression and alleviate pain. Elevating mean arterial pressures to prevent spinal cord ischemia and avoiding the second hit of SCI have become more common as opposed to high dose steroids. Ongoing clinical trials with pharmacological agents such as minocycline and riluzole have shown early, promising results in their ability to reduce cellular damage and facilitate recovery. Though SCI can be life changing, the available treatment options have aimed to reduce pain and minimize complications and maintain quality of life alongside rehabilitative services."

Expediently delivering interventions during the early postinjury period can have a tremendous impact on long-term functional recovery. This is largely due to the unique pathophysiology of SCI where the initial traumatic insult (primary injury) is followed by a progressive secondary injury cascade characterized by ischemia, proapoptotic signaling, and peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration. Over the subsequent hours, release of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic debris (DNA, ATP, reactive oxygen species) cyclically adds to the harsh postinjury microenvironment. As the lesions mature into the chronic phase, regeneration is severely impeded by the development of an astroglial-fibrous scar surrounding coalesced cystic cavities. Addressing these challenges forms the basis of current and upcoming treatments for SCI. This paper discusses the evidence-based management of a patient with SCI while emphasizing the importance of early definitive care. Key neuroprotective therapies are summarized including surgical decompression, methylprednisolone, and blood pressure augmentation. We then review exciting neuroprotective interventions on the cusp of translation such as Riluzole, Minocycline, magnesium, therapeutic hypothermia, and CSF drainage. We also explore the most promising neuroregenerative strategies in trial today including Cethrin™, anti-NOGO antibody, cell-based approaches, and bioengineered biomaterials. Each section provides a working knowledge of the key preclinical and patient trials relevant to clinicians while highlighting the pathophysiologic rationale for the therapies.

Minocycline hydrochloride (MH) is a clinically available antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drug that has been shown to target a broad range of secondary injury mechanisms via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, MH is only neuroprotective at high concentrations. The inability to translate the high doses of MH used in experimental animals to tolerable doses in human patients limits its clinical efficacy. In addition, the duration of MH treatment is limited because long-term systemic administration of high doses of MH has been shown to cause liver toxicity and even death. We have developed a drug delivery system in the form of hydrogel loaded with polysaccharide-MH complexes self-assembled by metal ions for controlled release of MH. This drug delivery system can be injected into the intrathecal space for local delivery of MH with sufficient dose and duration, without causing any additional tissue damage. We show that local delivery of MH at a dose that is lower than the standard human dose (3 mg/kg) was more effective in reducing secondary injury and promoting locomotor functional recovery than systemic injection of MH with the highest dose and duration reported in experimental animal SCI (90-135 mg/kg)."

Young adult male rats were subjected to experimental SCI by weight compression method. Minocycline (50mg/kg) and FK506 (1mg/kg) were administered orally in combination and individually to the SCI group daily for three weeks. During these three weeks, the recovery was measured using behavioral motor parameters (including BBB, Tarlov and other scorings) every other day for 29days after SCI. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the segment of the spinal cord centered at the injury site was removed for the histopathological studies as well as for biochemical analysis of monoamines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and some oxidative stress indices, such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), total glutathione (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). All behavioral results indicated that both drugs induced significant recovery from SCI with respect to time. The biochemical and histopathological results supported the behavioral findings, revealing significant recovery in the regeneration of the injured spinal tissues, the monoamine levels, and the oxidative stress indices. Overall, the effects of the tested drugs for SCI recovery were as follows: FK506+minocycline>minocycline>FK506 in all studied parameters. Thus, minocycline and FK506 may prove to be a potential therapy cocktail to treat acute SCI. However, further studies are warranted."

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI."

A spinal contusion was made at the T12 spinal segment in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using the NYU impactor. Behavioral tests for motor function were conducted before and after SCI and before and after TENS application. To assess spasticity, the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) was used before and after SCI, high-frequency (HF)/low-frequency (LF) TENS application at 3 different intensities (motor threshold [MT], 50% and 90% MT) or minocycline administration. Immunohistochemistry for microglia was performed at the lumbar spinal segments. Motor recovery reached a plateau approximately 28 days after SCI. Spasticity was well developed and was sustained above the MAS grade of 3, beginning at 28 days after SCI. HF-TENS at 90% MT significantly alleviated spasticity. Motor function did not show any significant changes with LF- or HF-TENS treatment. HF-TENS significantly reduced the proportion of activated microglia observed after SCI. Minocycline, the microglia inhibitor, also significantly alleviated spasticity with the reduction of activated microglia expression.

A total of 80 adult male Spraque-Dawley rats (breeded by the Baskent University Animal Research Center) were randomly divided into 4 groups. A T10 contusion injury was produced by using modified Allen technique in all groups except the control group. No medication was administered to the rats in the trauma group. Minocycline was administered intraperitoneally and intravenously to the treatment groups. Short-term and/or long-term neuroprotective effects of minocycline on the lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, glutathione), apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling), ultrastructure of spinal cord (tissue electron microscopy), and behavioral assessments (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan) were evaluated. As compared with the trauma group, tissue malondialdehyde and glutathione levels demonstrated that minocycline significantly diminishes lipid peroxidation. Electromicroscopic study showed that minocycline preserves the ultrastructure of spinal cord tissue in the early post-traumatic period. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling positive cells both 1 day and 28 days after SCI. Behavioral assessments showed significant improvement in the hind limb functions of minocycline receiving rats starting 7 days after the SCI. Any statistically significant difference was not found between intraperitoneal or intravenous routes for minocycline injection. Minocycline is neuroprotective and contributes to functional improvement after traumatic SCI by eliminating the destructive process of secondary injury. Having both satisfying anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in experimental models, it promises to be of therapeutic use in human SCI."

Animal studies and early clinical trials support its use in several neurological diseases. In animal spinal cord injury models, minocycline improved neurological and histological outcomes, reduced neuronal and oligodendroglial apoptosis, decreased microglial activation and reduced inflammation. A single-centre, human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of minocycline administration after spinal cord injury was undertaken for the purposes of dose optimization, safety assessment and to estimate outcome changes and variance. Neurological, functional, pharmacological and adverse event outcomes were compared between subjects administered 7 days of intravenous minocycline (n = 27) or placebo (n = 25) after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The secondary outcome used to assess neurological differences between groups that may warrant further investigation was motor recovery over 1 year using the American Spinal Cord Injury Association examination. Recruitment and analyses were stratified by injury severity and injury location a priori given the expected influence of these on the sensitivity of the motor exam. Minocycline administered at higher than previously reported human doses produced steady-state concentrations of 12.7 µg/ml (95% confidence interval 11.6-13.8) in serum and 2.3 µg/ml (95% confidence interval 2.1-2.5) in cerebrospinal fluid, mimicking efficacious serum levels measured in animal studies. Transient elevation of serum liver enzymes in one patient was the only adverse event likely related to the study drug. Overall, patients treated with minocycline experienced six points greater motor recovery than those receiving placebo (95% confidence interval -3 to 14; P = 0.20, n = 44). No difference in recovery was observed for thoracic spinal cord injury (n = 16). A difference of 14 motor points that approached significance was observed in patients with cervical injury (95% confidence interval 0-28; P = 0.05, n = 25). Patients with cervical motor-incomplete injury may have experienced a larger difference (results not statistically significant, n = 9). Functional outcomes exhibited differences that lacked statistical significance but that may be suggestive of improvement in patients receiving the study drug. The minocycline regimen established in this study proved feasible, safe and was associated with a tendency towards improvement across several outcome measures. Although this study does not establish the efficacy of minocycline in spinal cord injury the findings are encouraging and warrant further investigation in a multi-centre phase III trial.

Simvastatin is one of many hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors prescribed to lower cholesterol. These drugs are also known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, improve endothelial function, and modulate the immune system in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and SCI. As both drugs have translational potential, we evaluated their neuroprotective properties here in a clinically relevant model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical contusion SCI at C5 and were randomized to receive: 1. Minocycline 90 mg/kg x 3 days, 2. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days, 3. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days then 5mg/kg x 35 days, or 4. Saline (Control). Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, modified Montoya staircase test and grooming test. Forepaw sensitivity was also assessed using the electronic von Frey Aesthesiometer. The corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts were traced and the spinal cords were harvested 7 weeks after injury. The extent of gray matter and white matter sparing and corticospinal and rubrospinal tract sprouting were evaluated in cross sections of the spinal cord. In the end, neither minocycline nor simvastatin treatment was associated with improved performance on the behavioral tests, as compared to saline controls. Performance on the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, and von Frey sensory test were similar among all groups. Animals treated for 42 days with simvastatin scored significantly higher in the grooming score compared to other groups, but retrieved significantly fewer pellets on the modified Montoya staircase test than control and minocycline treated animals. Histologically, there were no significant differences in white and gray matter sparing and in the extent of corticospinal and rubrospinal sprouting between the four groups. In conclusion, both minocycline and simvastatin failed to improve functional and histological recovery in our model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury."

Here, we show that minocycline improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing apoptosis of oligodendrocytes via inhibition of proNGF production in microglia. After SCI, the stress-responsive p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was activated only in microglia, and proNGF was produced by microglia via the p38MAPK-mediated pathway. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced proNGF production in microglia in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Furthermore, minocycline treatment inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor expression and RhoA activation after injury.

We analyzed minocycline's neuroprotective effects over 28 days following contusion SCI and found significant functional recovery compared to tetracycline. Histology, immunocytochemistry, and image analysis indicated statistically significant tissue sparing, reduced apoptosis and microgliosis, and less activated caspase-3 and substrate cleavage.

A combination of growth factors, the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline, and cyclosporine A immunosuppression was used to enhance the survival of transplanted adult NPCs. Our results show the presence of a substantial number of surviving NPCs in the injured spinal cord up to 10 weeks after transplantation at the subacute stage of SCI. In contrast, cell survival was poor after transplantation into chronic lesions. After subacute transplantation, grafted cells migrated >5 mm rostrally and caudally. The surviving NPCs integrated principally along white-matter tracts and displayed close contact with the host axons and glial cells. Approximately 50% of grafted cells formed either oligodendroglial precursor cells or mature oligodendrocytes. NPC-derived oligodendrocytes expressed myelin basic protein and ensheathed the axons. We also observed that injured rats receiving NPC transplants had improved functional recovery as assessed by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale and grid-walk and footprint analyses.

Adult rats were subjected to a C7-C8 dorsal column transection, and the presence of apoptotic oligodendrocytes was assessed within the ascending sensory tract (AST) and descending CST in segments (3-7 mm) both proximal and distal to the injury site.

We first evaluated cytochrome c release at the injury epicenter after a T10 contusive SCI in rats. Cytochrome c release peaked at approximately 4-8 h postinjury. A dose-response study generated a safe pharmacological regimen that enabled i.p. minocycline to significantly lower cytosolic cytochrome c at the epicenter 4 h after SCI. In the long-term study, i.p. minocycline (90 mg/kg administered 1 h after SCI followed by 45 mg/kg administered every 12 h for 5 days) markedly enhanced long-term hind limb locomotion relative to that of controls. Coordinated motor function and hind limb reflex recoveries also were improved significantly. Histopathology suggested that minocycline treatment alleviated later-phase tissue loss, with significant sparing of white matter and ventral horn motoneurons at levels adjacent to the epicenter. Furthermore, glial fibrillary acidic protein and 2',3' cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase immunocytochemistry showed an evident reduction in astrogliosis and enhanced survival of oligodendrocytes. Therefore, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c is an important secondary injury mechanism in SCI. Drugs with multifaceted effects in antagonizing this process and microgliosis may protect a proportion of spinal cord tissue that is clinically significant for functional recovery. Minocycline, with its proven clinical safety, capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrated efficacy during a clinically relevant therapeutic window, may become an effective therapy for acute SCI."

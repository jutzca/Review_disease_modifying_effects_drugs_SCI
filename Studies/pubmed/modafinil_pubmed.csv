To determine the effects of Modafinil (MOD), given orally, following a complete SCI compared with animals receiving MBET and transected untreated animals and examine if changes exist in Connexin 36 (Cx-36) protein levels in the lumbar enlargement of animals for the groups described. Center for Translational Neuroscience, Little Rock, AR, USA. Adult female rats underwent complete transection (Tx) at T10 level. H-reflex testing was performed 30 days following Tx in one group, and after initiation of treatment with MOD in another group, and after MBET training in the third group. The Lumbar enlargement tissue was harvested and western blots were performed after immunoprecipitation techniques to compare Cx-36 protein levels. Statistically significant decreases in low frequency-dependent depression of the H-reflex were observed in animals that received MOD and those that were treated with MBET compared with the Tx, untreated group. Statistically significant changes in Cx-36 protein levels were not observed in animals treated with MOD compared with Tx, untreated animals. Normalization of the loss of low frequency -dependent depression of the H-reflex was demonstrated in the group receiving MOD and the group receiving MBET compared with the Tx, untreated group. Further work is needed to examine if Cx-36 protein changes occur in specific subregions of the spinal cord."

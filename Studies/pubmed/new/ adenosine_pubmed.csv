We previously showed the neuroprotective effects of COA-Cl, a novel synthesized adenosine analog, in a rat stroke model. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of COA-Cl in acute phase of SCI. SCI was induced in rats at the T9 vertebra by using a drop device. Rats were divided into acute and subacute groups. A 5-day dose of 6 mg/kg COA-Cl in saline was given to the acute group immediately after SCI and the subacute group 4 days after SCI. Motor function assessed by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scoring and inclined plane test improved significantly in the acute group while the subacute group did not. Histological evaluation and TUNEL staining revealed that both the cavity volume and apoptosis were significantly decreased in the acute group compared with the subacute group. In addition, pERK/ERK was increased in the acute group 7 days after SCI. These results suggest that COA-Cl exerts neuroprotective effects via the ERK pathway when administered in the acute phase after SCI, resulting in the recovery of motor function. COA-Cl could be a novel therapeutic agent for the acute phase of SCI.","adenosine"

So, we aimed to test the effect of treatment with miR-139-5p on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in mice with SCI and investigate the underlying mechanism. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-139-5p directly targeted mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), and miR-139-5p treatment suppressed Mst1 protein expression in damaged spinal cords of mice. Wild-type mice and Mst1(-/-) mice were exposed to SCI and treated with miR-139-5p agomir via intrathecal infusion. Treatment of SCI mice with miR-139-5p accelerated locomotor functional recovery, reduced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulations, and promoted neuronal survival in damaged spinal cords. Treatment with miR-139-5p enhanced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα), improved mitochondrial function, and suppressed NF-κB-related inflammation in damaged spinal cords. Deficiency of Mst1 had similar benefits in mice with SCI. Furthermore, miR-139-5p treatment did not provide further protection in Mst1(-/-) mice against SCI. In conclusion, miR-139-5p treatment enhanced functional recovery and reduced pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through targeting Mst1.","adenosine"

Curbing neuroinflammation would reduce the neuronal death and benefit functional recovery. In the current study, we used a HO-1-encoding lentivirus to transduce microglia, and adoptively transferred these microglia into injured rat spinal cords. Lentivirus-induced overexpression of exogenous HO-1 significantly inhibited microglia-mediated inflammatory response after SCI, as demonstrated by lower expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in transferred microglia. In addition, the overall post-SCI neuroinflammation was also suppressed by HO-1-overexpressing microglia, as indicated by less leukocyte infiltration and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the spinal cord. Consistently, the tissue damage and neuronal apoptosis were decreased in injured spinal cords, while the locomotor function was moderately improved. We further identified that adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling was involved in the regulatory effect of HO-1 on microglia, because HO-1 overexpression increased the activating phosphorylation of AMPKα. Moreover, the AMPK inhibitor compound C diminished the anti-inflammatory effect of HO-1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia in vitro. Taken together, we proved that microglial HO-1 reduced acute post-SCI neuroinflammation. Our study might provide a promising therapeutic approach to benefit SCI recovery.","adenosine"

However, both preclinical and clinical studies indicate the capacity of electrical and pharmacological interventions to synergistically increase the engagement of spinal sensorimotor networks and regain motor function after SCI. This study explored whether selective pharmacological antagonism of the adenosine A1 receptor subtype synergizes with ESS, thereby increasing motor response. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological antagonism of A1 receptors during ESS would produce facilitatory effects in spinal sensorimotor networks detected as an increased amplitude of spinally-evoked motor potentials and sustained duration of ESS induced activity. Terminal experiments were performed in adult rats using trains of stereotyped pulses at 40 Hz delivered at L5 with the local administration to the cord of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). We demonstrated that ESS combined with the blockage of A1 receptors increased the magnitude of the endogenous modulation and postponed the decay of responses that occur during ESS alone. Although DPCPX significantly increased the yield of repetitive stimulation in intact spinal cords, the effects of A1 antagonism on motor evoked responses after an acute spinal transection was not detected. These studies support the future investigation of the optimal dosage, methods of delivery, and systemic effects of the synergistic application of A1 antagonists and spinal stimulation in the intact and injured spinal cord.","adenosine"

In Chinese traditional medicine, the agonist of a purinergic receptor is believed to have a positive effect on SCIs, and 2-Methylthio-adenosine-5'-diphosphate (2-MesADP) is a selective agonist of the P2Y purinergic receptor. To investigate its therapeutic function and molecular mechanism in SCI, transcriptome analysis associated with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out at various time points after T9 crush injury. 2-MesADP demonstrated recovery of limb motor function at the 6 weeks after injury, accompanied by neuronal regeneration and axon remyelination at 2 and 6 weeks. Furthermore, gene profiling revealed alternated gene expression with the treatment of 2-MesADP. These genes were assigned to a total of 38 modules, followed by gene ontology analysis; of these, 18 represented neuronal apoptosis and regeneration, immune response, synaptic transmission, cell cycle, and angiogenesis. In the neuronal apoptosis and regeneration module, Nefh, NeuroD6, and Dcx in the 2-MesADP group were noticed due to their interesting expression pattern. The gene expression patterns of Mag, Mog, and Cnp, which played key roles in myelination, were significantly changed with the treatment of 2-MesADP.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of dBcAMP on learning, memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in the excitotoxically lesioned hippocampus. An excitotoxic lesion was induced in the hippocampi of 4-month-old male BALB/c mice by injecting 0.25 μg/μl into the lateral ventricles of both sides. The lesioned mice (L) were divided into L+dBcAMP and L+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) groups. Sham surgery (S) was done by the injection of 1 μl of sterile saline into the lateral ventricles. The sham surgery mice were divided into S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups. Mice in the L+dBcAMP and S+dBcAMP groups were treated with dBcAMP for 1 week (i.p., 50 mg/kg), whereas mice in the L+PBS and S+PBS groups were treated with PBS. The mice in all groups were subjected to water maze and passive avoidance tests at the end of the 4th week. Cresyl violet staining and NeuN and doublecortin immunostaining were done to analyze the morphology and neurogenesis. The water maze learning sessions did not show a significant difference in escape latency between the groups, suggesting an unimpaired learning ability of mice in all groups. The L+dBcAMP mice had significantly short entry latency and higher target quadrant time/distance traveled compared to the L+PBS group, suggesting better memory retention. The L+dBcAMP group had a significantly improved memory retention compared to the L+PBS mice during the passive avoidance test. Morphological studies showed significantly greater adult neurons and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice in the L+dBcAMP group compared to those in the L+PBS group. There was no significant difference between the S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups in the water maze/passive avoidance tests and the number of neurons.

The investigation was intended to elucidate whether SPT can exert neuroprotective effect by triggering neuronal autophagy after SCI. The study was also directed to investigate the role of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the autophagy facilitated by SPT. The SCI was developed in female Sprague-Dawley rats by damaging the T10 spinal level using an impounder impact. Three animals groups were investigated - Sham group, SCI group, and SCI + SPT group. The SCI + SPT group was administered with SPT (100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores and angle of incline test revealed that SPT administration improved the movement of hind limbs after SCI induction. Results indicated that SPT imparted neuronal protection, alleviated neuronal apoptosis, and improved neuronal autophagy. SPT-induced autophagy was identified by increased Beclin-1 expression and LC3B-positive neuronal cells. Further investigations revealed that SPT triggers the pathway involving AMPK/mTOR signaling, thereby stimulating autophagy in SCI-induced rat model. The findings of the present investigation strongly advocate the beneficial effects of SPT in the treatment of the SCI. SPT ameliorates the AMPK/mTOR signaling-induced autophagy and thereby improves functional recovery in SCI-induced rats.","adenosine"

Loss of mitochondrial homeostasis after SCI, mediated primarily by oxidative stress, is considered to play a crucial role in the proliferation of secondary injury cascade. We hypothesized that effective exogenous delivery of antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), encapsulated in biodegradable nanoparticles (nano-SOD/CAT) - at the lesion site would protect mitochondria from oxidative stress, and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury. Previously, in a rat contusion model of severe SCI, we demonstrated extravasation and retention of intravenously administered nanoparticles specifically at the lesion site. To test our hypothesis, a single dose of nano-SOD/CAT in saline was administered intravenously 6 h post-injury, and the spinal cords were analyzed one week post-treatment. Mitochondria isolated from the affected region of the spinal cord of nano-SOD/CAT-treated animals demonstrated significantly reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced calcium levels, and also higher adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production capacity than those isolated from the spinal cords of untreated control or SOD/CAT solution treated animals. Although the treatment did not achieve the same mitochondrial function as in the spinal cords of sham control animals, it significantly attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction following SCI. Further, immunohistochemical analyses of the spinal cords of treated animals showed significantly lower ROS, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c activities, leading to reduced spinal cord neuronal cell apoptosis and smaller lesion area than in untreated animals. These results imply that the treatment significantly attenuated progression of secondary injury that was also reflected from less weight loss and improved locomotive recovery of treated vs. untreated animals. In conclusion, nano-SOD/CAT mitigated activation of cascade of degenerating factors by protecting mitochondria and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury. An effective treatment during the acute phase following SCI could potentially have a positive long-term impact on neurological and functional recovery.","adenosine"

Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to look into the therapeutic effects of ECH on SCI and the underlying mechanisms. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, Nissl staining, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to examine the therapeutic effects of ECH on SCI. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in BV-2 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and adenosine 5'-triphosphate were examined. The expression levels of proteins involving NLRP3 inflammasome-related pathway were measured. The in vivo experiment indicated that administration of ECH significantly enhanced the BBB scores, reduced the neuron loss, and ameliorated the tissue architecture after SCI. Additionally, ECH dramatically inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the rat SCI model. In vitro study indicated that ECH significantly reduced ROS level, improved the MMP, blocked activation of NF-κB, and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. The effect of ECH on inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway was partially governed by suppression of the generation of ROS and activation of NF-κB. ECH can accelerate motor function recovery in rats following SCI by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome-related signaling pathway, suggesting that ECH may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating SCI.","adenosine"

In the first experiment, adult male rats received laminectomy or unilateral contusion at 3rd-4th cervical spinal cord at 9 weeks of age. The ventilatory behavior in response to mild acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (10 episodes of 5 min of hypoxia [10% O2, 4% CO2, 86% N2] with 5 min of normoxia intervals) was measured by whole-body plethysmography at the acute (∼3 days), subchronic (∼2 weeks), and chronic (∼8 weeks) injury stages. The minute ventilation of contused animals is significantly enhanced following acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia due to an augmentation of the tidal volume at all time-points post-injury. However, acute intermittent hypercapnia-hypoxia-induced ventilatory long-term facilitation was only observed in uninjured animals at the acute stage. During the second experiment, the effect of acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia on respiration was examined in contused animals after a blockade of serotonin receptors, or adenosine 2A receptors. The results demonstrated that acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia-induced enhancement of minute ventilation was attenuated by a serotonin receptor antagonist (methysergide) but enhanced by an adenosine 2A receptor antagonist (KW6002) at the subchronic and chronic injury stages. These results suggested that acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia can induce respiratory recovery from acute to chronic injury stages. The therapeutic effectiveness of intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia is dampened by the inhibition of serotonin receptors, but a blockade of adenosine 2A receptors enhanced respiratory recovery induced by intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia.","adenosine"

However, it remains unclear whether simultaneous inhibition of the 2 apoptosis pathways will be more beneficial for neuronal survival. Therefore, this study investigated the ability of coadministration of the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) and caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk to attenuate apoptosis in a rat SCI model. The rats were subjected to moderate contusive SCI. Locomotor function was measured using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating scales; neuronal apoptosis was detected using transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling; and immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to measure protein expression. We found the locomotor function of rats was weakened within 7 days post-SCI. At day 7 post-SCI, neuronal apoptosis dramatically increased and the expression of PARP-1, AIF, and cleaved caspase-3 was significantly upregulated. Further, Bcl-2 expression was significantly downregulated. The highest locomotor function recovery was recorded after the combined administration of 3-AB and z-DEVD-fmk for 7 days post-SCI when compared with 3-AB or z-DEVD-fmk administered alone. In addition, this combination therapy significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis by preventing upregulation of PARP-1 and AIF, inhibiting caspase-3 activation, and elevating Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that combination therapy is beneficial for neuronal function recovery in rats with SCI.

The striatal A2AR-D2R heteromer has a tetrameric structure and forms part of a signaling complex that includes a Gs and a Gi protein and the effector adenyl cyclase (subtype AC5). Another target of caffeine, the adenosine A1 receptor-dopamine D1 receptor (A1R-D1R) heteromer, seems to have a very similar structure.

And Behavioral, biochemical, molecular biological, immunofluorescent and histological assays were performed. First, ICA enhanced motor recovery greatly at 14, 28, and 42 days and protected spinal cord tissues especially in the high dose group.

Furthermore, ICA decreased the expression of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins at 3 days after SCI.

This study investigated whether Buyang huanwu decoction (BYHWD) combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation had synergistic effect on neuroprotection of red nucleus neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI). Rubrospinal tract (RST) transection model was established and BMSCs were collected. The forelimb locomotor function was recorded using inclined plate test and spontaneous vertical exploration. cAMP level in red nucleus was detected with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Morphology and number of red nucleus neurons was observed using Nissl's staining. Expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in red nucleus was detected using immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western-blotting. The combination of BYHWD and BMSCs transplantation could improve the forelimb locomotor function significantly and give the red nucleus somas a better protection. Meanwhile, cAMP level, CREB and NGF increased, while RhoA decreased remarkably in the BYHWD+BMSCs group. BYHWD combined with BMSCs transplantation had synergistic effect on neuroprotection of red nucleus neurons after SCI; the mechanism may be related to up-regulating cAMP level, activating the cAMP/CREB/RhoA signaling pathway, and promoting expression of NGF.","adenosine"

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death.","adenosine"

Macrophages/microglia exist in two states-the classically activated M1 phenotype that confers pro-inflammatory effects or the alternatively activated M2 phenotype that confers anti-inflammatory effects. Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is an immunosuppressive molecule intricately involved in adaptive and innate immune responses and is able to dephosphorylate AMP to adenosine. However, it is not known if CD73 is able to modulate the macrophages/microglia transformation between the M1 and M2 phenotypes. We used gene-deficient mice to determine the role of CD73 in macrophages/microglia polarization post-SCI in vivo. We used small interference RNA (siRNA) or pcDNA3.1 to inhibit or overexpress CD73 in BV2 cells to verify anterior discovery in vitro. A combination of molecular and histological methods was used to detect the macrophages/microglia polarization and explore the mechanism both in vivo and in vitro. We found that SCI induced the upregulation of CD73 expression. CD73 deficient mice were noted to demonstrate overwhelming immune responses, few anti-inflammatory phenotype macrophages/microglia, and had a poorer locomotor recovery in comparison to wild-type mice that were also inflicted with SCI. In vitro studies found that CD73 suppression inhibited the expression of characteristic microglial anti-inflammatory polarization markers in BV2 cells, while the converse was noted in CD73 overexpression. Subsequent experiments confirmed that CD73 promoted microglia alternative activation by stimulating p38 MAPK. We were able to conclude that CD73 imparts neuroprotective effects by mediating macrophages/microglia polarization. These findings allow for better understanding of the modulatory factors involved in triggering the change in macrophages/microglia phenotypes, therefore uncovering additional molecules and pathways that may be targeted in the innovation of novel SCI therapies.","adenosine"

The results obtained strongly indicate that resveratrol improved functional recovery in Sprague-Dawley rats after acute spinal cord injury, preserved their motor neurons, alleviated the neuronal apoptosis, and ameliorated neuronal autophagic flux. After blocking the autophagic flux, the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol were eliminated. Furthermore, it was proved that resveratrol can activate the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR/p70s6k pathway in vivo and in vitro, and the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR/p70s6k pathway plays a vital role in activating the autophagic flux mediated by resveratrol in PC12 cells.

In this study, we determined the effects of resveratrol on SCI and their potential relationship with SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis. To determine the effect of resveratrol on SCI recovery, a spinal cord contusion model was employed. Rats received treatment with resveratrol or DMSO immediately following contusion. We determined that Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were significantly higher for injured rats treated with resveratrol. Nissl and HE staining revealed that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and lesion size in the spinal cord of injured rats when compared to vehicle-treated animals. Spinal cord tissue was assessed by Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses 7days after injury for changes in expression of SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis proteins. Expression of SIRT1, p-AMPK, Beclin-1, LC3-B, and Bcl-2 was elevated in resveratrol-treated animals, whereas expression of p62, Cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) was inhibited. Immunofluorescence analysis of primary neurons treated with resveratrol alone or in combination with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) or EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) revealed that treatment with the inhibitors blocks the increased LC3-B expression in cells and increases the portion of TUNEL-positive cells. Taken together, these results suggest that resveratrol exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI by regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway.","adenosine"

When administered immediately following the injury, recovery was observed as early as 3days following SCI and it persisted until the end of the study, 28days after the drug delivery.

The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that intradiaphragmatic administration of nanoconjugate-bound DPCPX, enhances recovery of ventilation following SCI in the unanesthetized rat. To that end, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent C2 spinal cord hemisection (C2Hx) on day 0 and received either: (i) 0.15μg/kg of nanoconjugate-bound DPCPX or (ii) vehicle control (50μl distilled water).

Frequency, tidal volume, and minute ventilation data were analyzed in two minute bins while the animal was calm and awake. We found that a single administration of the nanoconjugate-bound A1 adenosine receptor antagonist facilitated recovery of tidal volume and minute ventilation following SCI. Furthermore, the treatment attenuated SCI-associated increases in respiratory frequency.

We hypothesized that rehabilitative motor training following spinal cord injuries promotes neuroplasticity via PKA activation. However, in two independent experiments, inhibition of cortical PKA using Rp-cAMPS throughout rehabilitative training robustly increased functional recovery and collateral sprouting of injured corticospinal tract axons, an indicator of neuroplasticity. Consistent with these in vivo findings, using cultured STHdh neurons, we found that Rp-cAMPS had no effect on the phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), a prominent downstream target of PKA, even with the concomitant application of the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin to increase cAMP levels. Conversely, when cAMP levels were increased using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, Rp-cAMPS potently inhibited CREB phosphorylation. Taken together, our results suggest that an alternate cAMP dependent pathway was involved in increasing CREB phosphorylation and neuroplasticity. This idea was supported by an in vitro neurite outgrowth assay, where inhibiting PKA did enhance neurite outgrowth. However, when PKA inhibition was combined with inhibition of EPAC2 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), another downstream target of cAMP in neurons, neurite outgrowth was significantly reduced. In conclusion, blocking PKA in cortical neurons of spinal cord injured rats increases neurite outgrowth of the lesioned corticospinal tract fibres and the efficacy of rehabilitative training, likely via EPAC.","adenosine"

We developed a protein-coupled nanoconjugate to selectively deliver by transsynaptic transport small therapeutic amounts of an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist to the respiratory centers. A single administration of the nanoconjugate restored 75% of the respiratory drive at 0.1% of the systemic therapeutic drug dose. The reduction of the systemic dose may obviate the side effects.

The leading causes of death in humans following SCI are respiratory complications secondary to paralysis of respiratory muscles. Systemic administration of methylxantines improves respiratory function but also leads to the development of deleterious side effects due to actions of the drug on nonrespiratory sites. The importance of the present study lies in the novel drug delivery approach that uses nanotechnology to selectively deliver recovery-inducing drugs to the respiratory centers exclusively.

The rat SCI was generated by an NYU impactor with a 10 g rod dropped from a 25 mm height at thoracic 9 spinal cord level. Caffeine and PBS were injected daily during the experiment period. Hind limb motor function was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale at 1 week and 4 weeks after the SCI. Spinal cord segments were collected after final behavior evaluation for morphological analysis. The tissue sparing was evaluated by luxol fast blue staining. Immunofluorescence stain was employed to assess astrocyte activation and neurofilament positioning, while microglia activation was examined by immunohistochemistry stain.The results showed that spontaneous functional recovery was blocked after the animals were subjected caffeine daily. Moreover, caffeine administration increased the demyelination area, promoted astrocyte and microglia activation and decreased the quantity of neurofilaments. These findings suggest that the neurotoxicity effect of caffeine may be associated with the inhibition of neural repair and the promotion of neuroinflammation.","adenosine"

Therefore, providing spinal tissue with an alternative energy substrate during ischemia may be neuroprotective after SCI. To assess this, rats received a mild contusive SCI (120 kdyn, Infinite Horizons impactor) at thoracic level 9 (T9), which causes loss of ∼ 80% of the ascending sensory dorsal column axonal projections to the gracile nucleus. Immediately afterwards, the energy substrate acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC; 1 mg/day) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was infused intrathecally (sub-arachnoid) for 6 days via an L5/6 catheter attached to a subcutaneous Alzet pump. ALC treatment improved overground locomotor function (Basso-Beattie-Breshnahan [BBB] score 18 vs. 13) at 6 days, total spared epicenter (71% vs. 57%) and penumbra white matter (90% vs. 85%), ventral penumbra microvessels (108% vs. 79%), and penumbra motor neurons (42% vs. 15%) at 15 days post-SCI, compared with PBS treatment. However, the ascending sensory projections (anterogradely traced with cholera toxin B from the sciatic nerves) and dorsal column white matter and perfused blood vessels were not protected. Furthermore, grid walking, a task we have shown to be dependent on dorsal column function, was not improved. Thus, mitochondrial substrate replacement may only be efficacious in areas of lesser or temporary ischemia, such as the ventral spinal cord and injury penumbra in this study. The current data also support our previous evidence that microvessel loss is central to secondary tissue degeneration.","adenosine"

Thus, we are going to screen the effectiveness of telmisartan in SCI for the development of it in clinical application. In the present study, we used compressive SCI in rats. Telmisartan was then used to evaluate the influence in rats after SCI. Change in PPARδ expression was identified by Western blots. Also, behavioral tests were performed to check the recovery of damage. Recovery of damage from SCI was observed in telmisartan-treated rats. Additionally, this action of telmisartan was inhibited by GSK0660 at the dose sufficient to block PPARδ. However, metformin at the dose enough to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase failed to produce similar action as telmisartan. Thus, mediation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in this action of telmisartan can be rule out. Moreover, telmisartan reversed the expressions of PPARδ in rats with SCI. The obtained data suggest that telmisartan can improve the damage of SCI in rats through an increase in PPARδ expression.

We have shown that increases in the number of dividing NG2-positive cells through short-term pharmacologic inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases contributes to recovery after spinal cord injury. A conditioning sciatic nerve crush (SNC) preceding spinal cord injury stimulates central sensory axon regeneration via the intraganglionic action of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Here, using bromodeoxyuridine, mitomycin (mitosis inhibitor), and cholera toxin B tracer, we demonstrate that SNC-induced division of spinal glia is related to the spinal induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and contributes to central sensory axon growth into the damaged spinal cord. Dividing cells were mainly NG2-positive and Iba1-positive and included myeloid NG2-positive populations. The cells dividing in response to SNC mainly matured into oligodendrocytes and microglia within the injured spinal cord. Some postmitotic cells remained NG2-reactive and were associated with regenerating fibers. Moreover, intraganglionic tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression was induced after administration of SNC or cyclic adenosine monophosphate analog (dbcAMP) to dorsal root ganglia in vivo and in primary adult dorsal root ganglia cultures. Collectively, these findings support a novel model whereby a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-activated regeneration program induced in sensory neurons by a conditioning peripheral nerve lesion uses tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 to protect against short-term proteolysis, enabling glial cell division and promoting axon growth into the damaged CNS.","adenosine"

We investigated the respective contributions of Dia and T2 EIC to daily AIH-induced functional recovery of breathing capacity with/without A2A receptor antagonist (KW6002, i.p.) following C2 hemisection (C2HS).

Then, we hypothesized that PHB1 overexpression by delivery of Ad-PHB1 could result in neuroprotection and promote functional recovery following SCI. Briefly, Wistar rats received a 35-g clip-compression injury and were administered Ad-PHB1 or Ad immediately following SCI. It was found that Ad-PHB1 administration significantly improved locomotor function and increased pain tolerance in rats with SCI. Furthermore, Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI attenuated axonal degradation and increased neuron sparing. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI reduced apoptosis through inhibiting the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 pathway. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress, evidenced by reduced mRNA levels of CCAAT enhancer binding protein homologous protein, chaperone-ucose-regulated protein 78, and X-box protein 1. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI restored mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate formation, reduced reactive oxygen species formation, and improved mitochondrial respiration rates. Finally, Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI activated downstream signals including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and nuclear factor-kappaB. These data indicate that the PHB1 plays an important role in the development of SCI and might provide a therapeutic target to promote recovery from SCI.","adenosine"

The animals receiving systemic administration of squalenoyl adenosine nanoassemblies showed a significant improvement of their neurologic deficit score in the case of cerebral ischaemia, and an early motor recovery of the hindlimbs in the case of spinal cord injury. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the nanoassemblies were able to extend adenosine circulation and its interaction with the neurovascular unit.

Inosine is a naturally occurring metabolite of adenosine that crosses the cell membrane and, in neurons, activates Mst3b, a protein kinase that is part of a signal transduction pathway that regulates axon outgrowth. Compared to saline-treated controls, rats with dorsal hemisections that were treated with inosine showed three times as many synaptic contacts between corticospinal tract collaterals and long propriospinal interneurons that project from the cervical cord to the lumbar level.

Subsequent changes in cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor ""cAMP response element-binding protein"" (CREB) are also analyzed. Rats with moderate weight-drop injury at segment T8 received 2h of NRM stimulation beginning three days after injury, followed immediately by separate extraction of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord for immunochemical assay. Controls lacked injury, stimulation or both. Injury reduced cAMP levels to under half of normal in all three spinal regions. NRM stimulation completely restored these levels, while producing no significant change in non-injured rats. Pretreatment with the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist pimozide (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) lowered cAMP in non-injured rats to injury amounts, which were unchanged by NRM stimulation. The phosphorylated fraction of PKA (pPKA) and CREB (pCREB) was reduced significantly in all three regions after SCI and restored by NRM stimulation, except for pCREB in lumbar segments. In conclusion, SCI produces spreading deficits in cAMP, pPKA and pCREB that are reversible by Gs protein-coupled 5-HT receptors responding to raphe-spinal activity, although these signaling molecules are not reactive to NRM stimulation in normal tissue. These findings can partly explain the benefits of NRM stimulation after SCI.","adenosine"

Whereas the ATP concentration in the extracellular space is normally in the micromolar range, under these conditions it increases to millimolar levels. A number of ligand-gated cationic channels termed P2X receptors (7 mammalian subtypes), and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (8 mammalian subtypes) are located at astrocytes, as confirmed by the measurement of the respective mRNA and protein. Activation of both the P2X7 and P2Y1,2 subtypes identified at astrocytes initiates astrogliosis isolating damaged brain areas from surrounding healthy cells and synthesizing neurotrophins and pleotrophins that participate in neuronal recovery. Astrocytes are considered as cells of high plasticity which may alter their properties in a culture medium. Therefore, recent work concentrates on investigating nucleotide effects at in situ (acute brain slices) and in vivo astrocytes. A wealth of data relates to the involvement of purinergic mechanisms in astrogliosis induced by acute CNS injury such as mechanical trauma and hypoxia/ischemia. The released ATP may act within minutes as an excitotoxic molecule; at a longer time-scale within days it causes neuroinflammation. These effects sum up as necrosis/apoptosis on the one hand and proliferation on the other. Although the role of nucleotides in chronic neurodegenerative illnesses is not quite clear, it appears that they aggravate the consequences of the primary disease. Epilepsy and neuropathic pain are also associated with the release of ATP and a pathologic glia-neuron interaction leading to astrogliosis and cell death. In view of these considerations, P2 receptor antagonists may open new therapeutic vistas in all forms of acute and chronic CNS damage.","adenosine"

The resolving M2 macrophages (Ly6c(lo)CX3CR1(hi)) derived from monocytes trafficked through a remote blood-cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) barrier, the brain-ventricular choroid plexus (CP), via VCAM-1-VLA-4 adhesion molecules and epithelial CD73 enzyme for extravasation and epithelial transmigration. Blockage of these determinants, or mechanical CSF flow obstruction, inhibited M2 macrophage recruitment and impaired motor-function recovery. The CP, along with the CSF and the central canal, provided an anti-inflammatory supporting milieu, potentially priming the trafficking monocytes. Overall, our finding demonstrates that the route of monocyte entry to central nervous system provides an instructional environment to shape their function.","adenosine"

In this study, using a minipump-based infusion system, we found that intraspinal infusion with VPA for 3 days into injured spinal cord significantly improved hindlimb locomotion of rats with severe SCI induced by a 10-g NYU impactor dropping from the height of 50 mm onto the spinal T9/10 segment. The neuronal fibers in the injured spinal cord tissues were significantly preserved in VPA-treated rats compared with those observed in vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, the accumulation of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the injured spinal cord was attenuated in the animal group receiving VPA infusion. VPA also significantly reduced P2X4 R expression post-SCI. Furthermore, in vitro study indicated that VPA, but not the other HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA), caused downregulation of P2X4 R in microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-triggered signaling was involved in the effect of VPA on the inhibition of P2X4 R gene expression. In addition to the findings from others, our results also provide important evidence to show the inhibitory effect of VPA on P2X4 R expression in activated microglia, which may contribute to reduction of SCI-induced gliosis and subsequently preservation of spinal cord tissues. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adenosine"

Induction of self-renewal and proliferation of endogenous regenerative machinery with noninvasive and nontoxic therapies could constitute a real hope and an alternative to cell transplantation for spinal cord injury patients. We previously showed that FM19G11 promotes differentiation of adult spinal cord-derived ependymal stem cells under hypoxia. Interestingly, FM19G11 induces self-renewal of these ependymal stem cells grown under normoxia. The analysis of the mechanism of action revealed an early increment of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 and 2 with an early drop of ATP, followed by a subsequent compensatory recovery with activated mitochondrial metabolism and the induction of glucose uptake by upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-4. Here we show that phosphorylation of AKT and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is involved in FM19G11-dependent activation of GLUT-4, glucose influx, and consequently in stem cell self-renewal. Small interfering RNA of uncoupling protein 1/2, GLUT-4 and pharmacological inhibitors of AKT, mTOR and AMPK signaling blocked the FM19G11-dependent induction of the self-renewal-related markers Sox2, Oct4, and Notch1.

Previous studies have demonstrated that rolipram, an anti-inflammatory and cyclic adenosine monophosphate preserving small molecule, improves spinal cord regeneration when delivered systemically. However, more recent studies showed that rolipram has some adverse effects in spinal cord repair. Here, we developed a drug-delivery platform for the local delivery of rolipram into the spinal cord. The potential of drug-eluting microfibrous patches for continuous delivery of high and low-dose rolipram concentrations was characterized in vitro. Following C5 hemisections, athymic rats were treated with patches loaded with low and high doses of rolipram. In general, animals treated with low-dose rolipram experienced greater functional and anatomical recovery relative to all other groups. Outcomes from the high-dose rolipram treatment were similar to those with no treatment. In addition, high-dose treated animals experienced reduced survival rates suggesting that systemic toxicity was reached. With the ability to control the release of drug dosage locally within the spinal cord, drug-eluting microfibrous patches demonstrate the importance of appropriate local release-kinetics of rolipram, proving their usefulness as a therapeutic platform for the study and repair of SCI.","adenosine"

Among those, we have focused on microRNA 486, which directly represses NeuroD6 expression through a conserved sequence in its untranslated region. We correlated the overexpression of microRNA 486 in motor neurons with a poor outcome due to progressive neurodegeneration and a pathophysiology that is mediated by reactive oxygen species. The expression of microRNA 486 was induced by reactive oxygen species that were produced by inflammatory factors, and reactive oxygen species were accumulated in response to the knockdown of NeuroD6, which enhances the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 3 and thioredoxin-like 1 after traumatic spinal cord injury. NeuroD6 directly bound to regulatory regions of thioredoxin-like 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 in motor neurons and activated their expression, which promoted reactive oxygen species scavenging. Moreover, knocking down microRNA 486 induced the expression of NeuroD6, which effectively ameliorated the spinal cord injury and allowed the mice to recover motor function. The infusion of exogenic NeuroD6 in spinal cord injury lesions effectively blocked apoptosis by reactivating thioredoxin-like 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3, which was accompanied by a recovery of motor function. Collectively, these findings have identified a novel microRNA in spinal cord injury lesions called microRNA 486, demonstrating a new role for NeuroD6 in neuroprotection, and suggest a potential therapeutic target for spinal cord injuries.","adenosine"

Previous studies have shown that excessive ATP release from peritraumatic regions contributes to the inflammatory response to SCI by activation of low-affinity P2X7 receptors. Because connexin hemichannels constitute an important route for astrocytic ATP release, we here evaluated the impact on post-traumatic ATP release of deletion of connexins (Cx30/Cx43) in astrocytes. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed a significant reduction in ATP release after weight-drop injury in mice with deletion of Cx43 compared with Cx43-expressing littermates, both on a Cx30 knockout background. Moreover, astrogliosis and microglia activation were reduced in peritraumatic areas of those mice lacking Cx43; motor recovery was also significantly improved, and the traumatic lesion was smaller.

However, while traditional therapeutic efforts to combat traumatic injuries of the central nervous system (CNS) have not been successful, nanotechnology-based drug delivery has become a new emerging strategy with the additional promise of targeted membrane repair. As such, this potential use of nanotechnology provides new avenues for nanomedicine that uses nanoparticles themselves as the therapeutic agent in addition to their other functionalities. Here we will specifically address new advances in experimental treatment of Spinal Cord and Traumatic Brain injury (SCI and TBI respectively). We focus on the concept of repair of the neurolemma and axolemma in the acute stage of injury, with less emphasis on the worthwhile, and voluminous, issues concerning regenerative medicine/nanomedicine. It is not that the two are mutually exclusive - they are not. However, the survival of the neuron and the tissues of white matter are critical to any further success in what will likely be a multi-component therapy for TBI and SCI. This review includes a brief explanation of the characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury SCI, the biological basis of the injuries, and the treatment opportunities of current polymer-based therapies. In particular, we update our own progress in such applications for CNS injuries with various suggestions and discussion, primarily nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems. The application of nanoparticles as drug-delivery vehicles to the CNS may likely be advantageous over existing molecular-based therapies.

We used 51 male rats subjected to a thoracic SCI for a 12-week survival study: (1) SCI+vehicle, (2) SCI+GRP, (3) SCI+cAMP, (4) SCI+GRP+cAMP, and (5) uninjured endpoint age-matched control (AM).

GRP cells survived, differentiated, and formed extensive transplants that were well integrated with host tissue. Presence of GRP cells increased the amount of tissue in the lesion; however, cAMP reduced the graft size. White matter sparing at the lesion epicenter was not affected. Serotonergic input to the lumbosacral spinal cord was not affected by treatment, but the amount of serotonin immediately caudal to the lesion was reduced in the cAMP groups. Using telemetric monitoring of corpus spongiosum penis pressure we show that the cAMP groups regained the same number of micturitions per 24hours when compared to the AM group, however, the frequency of peak pressures was increased in these groups compared to the AM group. In contrast, the GRP groups had similar frequency of peak pressures compared to baseline and the AM group. Animals that received GRP cells regained the same number of erectile events per 24hours compared to baseline and the AM group. Since cAMP reduced the GRP transplant graft, and some modest positive effects were seen that could be attributable to both GRP or cAMP, future research is required to determine how cAMP affects survival, proliferation, and/or function of progenitor cells and how this is related to function. cAMP may not always be a desirable addition to a progenitor cell transplantation strategy after SCI.","adenosine"

The effects of this signaling pathway on repair of spinal cord injury (SCI), however, have not been well elucidated. ATP is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of signal transduction pathways, and plays important roles in functional recovery after nervous system injury. In the present study, we examined the ATP-induced changes of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in injured spinal cord of adult rats and potential therapeutic effects of this pathway on SCI-induced locomotor dysfunction. SCI was produced by extradural weight-drop using modified Allen's stall with damage energy of 50 g-cm force. The rats were divided into four groups: SCI plus ATP, SCI plus saline, SCI plus ATP and rapamycin, and sham-operated. Using immunostaining studies, Western blot analyses and real-time qualitative RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrated that the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway is present in the injured spinal cord and the expression of its components at the protein and mRNA levels is significantly elevated by exogenous administration of ATP following SCI.

We concluded that ATP injection produced a significant activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in the injured spinal cord and that enhancement of rapamycin-sensitive signaling produces beneficial effects on SCI-induced motor function defects and repair potential.

To this end, we examined the molecular changes set in motion by SCI that affect the channel properties of AMPA receptors. SCI strongly reduced the level of AMPA receptor R/G editing, involving not only the site of the lesion but also adjacent areas of the cord spared by the lesion. The effects, with changes for some subunits and loci, were observed as long as 30 days after lesioning and may correlate with a partial decrease in enzymatic activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), as deduced from the analysis of ADAR2 self-editing. The reduced editing at the R/G site of glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs) is likely to reduce post-synaptic excitatory responses to glutamate, thus limiting the progression of cell death; however, prolonged suppression of GluR function in later stages may hinder synaptic plasticity.

Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a central OxPhos component and changes in its activity reflect changes in energy demand. A recent study suggests that respiratory muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is compromised via alterations in mitochondrial function. In an animal model of cervical spinal cord hemisection (C2HS) respiratory dysfunction, we have shown that theophylline improves respiratory function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that theophylline improves respiratory function at the cellular level via improved mitochondrial function in the C2HS model. We demonstrate that CcO activity was significantly (33%) increased in the spinal cord adjacent to the site of injury (C3-C5), and that administration of theophylline (20mg/kg 3x daily orally) after C2HS leads to an even more pronounced increase in CcO activity of 62% compared to sham-operated animals. These results are paralleled by a significant increase in cellular ATP levels (51% in the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection).

The regeneration of injured neurons is a process involving many intracellular phenomena, including cytoskeletal changes, gene and protein expression, and changes in the responsiveness to extracellular cues. The capacity of injured neurons to regenerate is modulated to some extent by changes in the expression of intracellular signaling molecules such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.

After traumatic injury to the CNS, such as spinal cord injury, persistent release of ATP from damaged neurons and activated glial cells occurs, inducing detrimental and/or beneficial effects via activation of ionotropic (P2XR) and metabotropic purinergic receptors. In this study, we show a decrease in GLAST mRNA in the lesion center and caudal portions at 24 h post-spinal cord injury. In an in vitro system, the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate and astrocytic GLAST mRNA levels were significantly decreased after exposure to ATP and its P2X(7)R agonist, 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP. ATP- or 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP-induced inhibitory effect on GLAST mRNA expression was blocked by the irreversible P2X(7)R blocker, oxidized ATP, or when P2X(7)R mRNA expression was reduced by the lentivirus-short hairpin RNA knockdown approach. Furthermore, deletion of the GLAST promoter and RNA decay assays showed that P2X(7)R signaling triggered post-transcriptional regulation of GLAST expression via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase cascade. The signaling pathway participating in the P2X(7)R effect on GLAST mRNA expression was identified as a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase-phospholipase Cgamma involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and protein kinase C. We conclude that P2X(7)R activation by sustained release of ATP in the injured CNS may decrease GLAST mRNA stability via Ca(2+)-dependent signaling, suggesting that inhibition of P2X(7)R may allow for recovery of astrocytic GLAST function and protect neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.","adenosine"

Although secondary injury should, in principle, be preventable, no effective treatment options currently exist for patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Excessive release of ATP by the traumatized tissue, followed by activation of high-affinity P2X7 receptors, has previously been implicated in secondary injury, but no clinically relevant strategy by which to antagonize P2X7 receptors has yet, to the best of our knowledge, been reported. Here we have tested the neuroprotective effects of a systemically administered P2X7R antagonist, Brilliant blue G (BBG), in a weight-drop model of thoracic SCI in rats. Administration of BBG 15 min after injury reduced spinal cord anatomic damage and improved motor recovery without evident toxicity. Moreover, BBG treatment directly reduced local activation of astrocytes and microglia, as well as neutrophil infiltration. These observations suggest that BBG not only protected spinal cord neurons from purinergic excitotoxicity, but also reduced local inflammatory responses. Importantly, BBG is a derivative of a commonly used blue food color (FD&C blue No. 1), which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Systemic administration of BBG may thus comprise a readily feasible approach by which to treat traumatic SCI in humans.","adenosine"

In an animal model of SCI, an upper cervical spinal cord hemisection paralyzes the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the side of injury. However, a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore respiratory function after injury. In this review, restoration of respiratory activity following systemic administration of theophylline, a respiratory stimulant will be discussed. Pharmacologically, theophylline is a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a bronchodilator. It has been used in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in treatment of apnea in premature infants. However, the clinical use of theophylline to improve respiration in SCI patients with respiratory deficits is a more recent approach. This review will focus on the use of theophylline to restore respiratory activity in an animal model of SCI. In this model, a C2 hemisection (C2HS) interrupts the major descending respiratory pathways and paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. The review also highlights involvement of central and peripheral adenosine receptors in functional restitution. Biochemical binding assays that highlight changes in adenosine receptors after chronic theophylline administration are discussed as they pertain to understanding adenosine receptor-mediation in functional recovery.

For these reasons, and that oligodendrocyte and axon survival may be related, various neuroprotective strategies after spinal cord injury are being investigated. We previously demonstrated that oligodendrocytes in the adult rat epicenter ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) express 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and that their death was attenuated up to 3 days after contusive cervical SCI when rolipram, a specific inhibitor of PDE4, was administered.

Here, we test the hypothesis that an acute administration of rolipram will increase spinal and medullary levels of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and induce phrenic nerve recovery after cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left C2 hemisection surgery 1 week before experimentation. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anesthetized, vagotomized, and pancuronium paralyzed rats, and rolipram was intravenously applied (2 mg/kg). Intravenous administration of rolipram increased phrenic nerve output in uninjured control and left C2 spinal cord-hemisected rats. In addition, rolipram restored respiratory-related activity to the left phrenic nerve made quiescent by the hemisection. In both uninjured and hemisected rats, rolipram significantly enhanced phrenic inspiratory burst amplitude and burst area compared with predrug values. Also, rolipram concomitantly increased spinal and medullary cAMP. These results suggest that a phosphodiesterase inhibitor capable of elevating cAMP levels can enhance phrenic nerve output and restore respiratory-related phrenic nerve function after high cervical spinal cord injury.

However, activation of various physiological mechanisms secondary to the initial trauma including edema, inflammation, excito-toxicity, excessive cytokine release and apoptosis may exacerbate the injury and/or retard natural repair mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSCs) inhibits H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis of cultured spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulting in increased cell survival. The ATSC extracts mediated this effect by decreasing caspase-3 and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activity, inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria and reducing Bax expression levels in cells. Direct injection of ATSC extracts mixed with Matrigel into the spinal cord immediately after SCI also resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death, astrogliosis and hypo-myelination but did not reduce the extent of microglia infiltration. Moreover, animals injected with the ATSC extract showed significant functional improvement of hind limbs as measured by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale. Collectively, these studies show a prominent therapeutic effect of ATSC cytoplasmic extracts on SCI principally caused by an inhibition of apoptosis-mediated cell death, which spares white matter, oligodendrocytes and neurons at the site of injury. The ability of ATSC extracts to prevent secondary pathological events and improve neurologic function after SCI suggests that extracts prepared from autologous cells harvested from SCI patients may have clinical utility.","adenosine"

Administration of CGS-21680 before DPCPX (n=6) in H-CBI rats induced a significantly greater recovery (58.5 +/- 3.6%) than when DPCPX (42.6 +/- 4.6%) was administered (n=6) alone. In H-CBE rats, prior administration of CGS-21680 (n=6) did not enhance recovery over that induced by DPCPX (n=6) alone. Recovery in H-CBE rats amounted to 39.7 +/- 3.7% and 38.4 + 4.2%, respectively. Our results suggest that adenosine A2 receptors located in the carotid bodies can enhance the magnitude of adenosine A1 receptor-mediated recovery of respiratory function after C2 hemisection. We conclude that a novel approach of targeting peripheral and central adenosine receptors can be therapeutically beneficial in alleviating compromised respiratory function after cervical spinal cord injury.","adenosine"

Due to accumulation of numerous axon-growth inhibitory molecules the lesion scar is considered a major impediment for axon regeneration. Following transection of the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) at thoracic level 8 in adult rats, transient suppression of collagenous scarring in the lesion zone by local application of a potent iron chelator and cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulted in the delay of fibrous scarring. Treated animals displayed long-distance growth of CST axons through the lesion area extending for up to 1.5-2 cm into the distal cord. In addition, the treatment showed a strong neuroprotective effect, rescuing cortical motoneurons projecting into the CST that normally die (30%) after thoracic axotomy. Further, anterogradely traced CST axons regenerated through both grey and white matter and developed terminal arborizations in grey matter regions. In contrast to controls, injured animals receiving treatment showed significant functional recovery in the open field, in the horizontal ladder and in CatWalk locomotor tasks. We conclude that the fibrous lesion scar plays a pivotal role as a growth barrier for regenerating axons in adult spinal cord and that a delay in fibrotic scarring by local inhibition of collagen biosynthesis and basement membrane deposition is a promising and unique therapeutic strategy for treating human spinal trauma.","adenosine"

The purpose of this review is to describe mechanisms that underlie theophylline-induced recovery of respiratory-related function following C2 hemisection and to underscore the therapeutic potential of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline mediates recovery of respiratory-related activity via antagonism of central adenosine A(1) receptors. When administered chronically, the drug restores and maintains recovered function. Since theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist with affinity for both the adenosine A(1) and A(2) receptors, we assessed the relative contributions of each receptor to functional recovery. While A(1) receptor antagonism plays a predominant role, activation of the A(2) receptors by specific agonists subserves the A(1) receptor-mediated actions. That is, when an adenosine A(2) receptor agonist is administered first, it primes the system such that subsequent administration of the A(1) antagonist induces a greater degree of recovered respiratory activity than when the antagonist alone is administered. Chronic oral administration of theophylline in C2 hemisected animals demonstrates that even when animals have been weaned from the drug, theophylline-induced recovered respiratory actions persist. This suggests that in clinical application, it may not be necessary to maintain patients on long-term theophylline. We have shown that recovery of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve can occur spontaneously 3-4 months after C2 hemisection. Theophylline administration after this post-injury period obliterates/negates the recovery function. This indicates strongly that there is therapeutic window (more acutely after injury) for the initiation of theophylline therapy. We have also demonstrated that peripheral (carotid bodies) adenosine A(1) receptors can be selectively activated to modulate theophylline-induced CNS actions. Blocking central adenosine receptors while simultaneously activating peripheral adenosine receptors minimizes the potential of respiratory muscle fatigue with theophylline. The significance of the current findings lies in the potential clinical application of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. The ultimate goal of theophylline therapy is to wean ventilator-dependent patients off ventilatory support. Thus far, our animal studies suggest that the onset of theophylline therapy must be soon after injury.","adenosine"

In this model, an upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemi paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Theophylline restores respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed hemidiaphragm via activation of a latent respiratory motor pathway. Antagonism of central adenosine A1 receptors mediates this action. Theophylline also enhances respiratory frequency, f, defined as breaths per minute. Thus, long-term use may result in respiratory muscle or motoneuron fatigue particularly after spinal cord injury. We assessed the effects of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, N6-p-sulfophenyladenosine (p-SPA) on theophylline's action in our model under standardized recording conditions. Four groups of rats, classified as hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies denervated (H-CBD or NH-CBD), and hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies intact (H-CBI or NH-CBI ) were used in the study. Eight days after recovery from carotid denervation, a left C2 hemi was performed in H-CBD rats. C2 hemi was also performed in H-CBI animals, and 24 h later, electrophysiologic experiments on respiratory activity were conducted in both groups of animals. Two groups using nonhemisected controls were also employed as described above. In H-CBD rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced respiratory-related activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In NH-CBD rats, theophylline significantly enhanced f. In both H-CBD and NH-CBD rats, p-SPA (0.25 mg/kg) did not significantly change theophylline-induced effects. In H-CBI rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In H-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced the values to pre-theophylline discharge levels. Recovered activity was not obliterated with the agonist. In NH-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced theophylline-induced effects to pre-drug discharge levels. Adenosine A1 and A2A receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the carotid bodies. The significance of our findings is that theophylline-induced effects can be normalized to pre-drug levels by the selective activation of peripheral adenosine A1 receptors. The therapeutic benefits of theophylline, i.e., recovered respiratory function after paralysis, however, persists. The potential therapeutic impact is that respiratory muscle fatigue associated with long-term theophylline use may be minimized by a novel therapeutic approach.","adenosine"

In the three patients who had SCI but did not receive MP, muscle biopsies were normal and EMGs did not reveal evidence of myopathy. Our data suggest that MP in the dose recommended by the NASCIS may cause ACM.

Following is a brief summary of previous findings that led us to examine cAMP levels after SCI and to test the hypothesis that elevating the level of cAMP could improve nerve fiber growth and functional outcome. We employed in these experiments an incomplete SCI model, whereby a specific weight is dropped from a consistent height onto the exposed surface of the spinal cord at the thoracic (chest) level to induce a bruising type injury. The elevation of cAMP was used in combination with the transplantation of a type of peripheral nerve cells, called Schwann cells. Lastly, the implications of our findings for human SCI repair are discussed.Regeneration of neurons within the central nervous system following SCI is limited by the presence of inhibitory molecules and a lack of growth supporting molecules at the injury site, by the physical barrier created by a scar that forms around the injury site, and by a reduced intrinsic capacity for growth in neurons that occurs after development and maturation. Transplantation of cells from the peripheral nervous system -- Schwann cells -- can be used to replace lost tissue within the injured spinal cord and form an environment conducive for nerve fiber re-growth. Importantly, Schwann cell transplantation is clinically relevant because of the feasibility of autologous transplantation from harvested peripheral nerves for use in human SCI. However, Schwann cell grafts do not enable regenerated nerve fibers to grow out of the transplant, and they elicit only a weak response from neurons from the brain that are important for voluntary control of walking. These limitations have stimulated the development of combination strategies that will improve the ability of Schwann cells to promote repair of the injured spinal cord and enhance functional recovery.","adenosine"

Theophylline mediates functional recovery by central nervous system adenosine A1 receptor antagonism; however, it is unclear whether adenosine receptors are altered after prolonged postinjury periods and whether theophylline can further enhance restored respiratory function that occurs spontaneously. To assess putative effects of systemic theophylline administration on further enhancing spontaneous respiratory muscle recovery 4 months after C2 hemisection in rats and to determine whether adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression is altered in these animals. Electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity in the phrenic nerves was conducted in C2 hemisected rats 4 months after hemisection under standardized conditions. Immediately thereafter, rats were killed and the cervical spinal cords were prepared for adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. Spontaneous recovery of respiratory activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve was detected in a majority (15/20) of C2 hemisected animals and amounted to 44.06% +/- 2.38% when expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral phrenic nerve in noninjured animals. At the optimal dosage used in the acute studies, theophylline (15 mg/kg) did not enhance, but rather unexpectedly blocked, recovered respiratory activity in 4 out of 5 animals tested. At dosages of 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, the drug blocked recovered respiratory activity in 3 out of 4 and 3 out of 5 animals tested, respectively. Quantitative analysis of adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression did not reveal a significant difference between experimental animals and sham-operated animals. The blockade or attenuation of spontaneously recovered respiratory activity following theophylline administration cannot be attributed to changes in adenosine A1 receptors because there were no significant differences in adenosine A1 mRNA expression with sham-operated animals. Lack of alteration in A1 mRNA expression 4 months after cervical SCI suggests that A1 receptor plasticity is not activated by chronic injury. Obliteration of spontaneous recovery with theophylline most likely involves a separate unknown mechanism. These findings suggest that there may be a limited therapeutic window for the clinical application of theophylline in SCI patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline may be more effective clinically in the acute phase of injury rather than in the chronic phase.","adenosine"

Previous studies from our laboratory have established that a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore function to a hemidiaphragm paralysed by upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection during a reflex known as the 'crossed phrenic phenomenon'. In addition, theophylline, a general adenosine A1 and A2 receptor antagonist, can activate the latent pathway by acting centrally through antagonism at adenosine receptors. 2. The present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in inducing functional recovery in our model of spinal cord injury. Specific adenosine A1 and A2 agonists and antagonists were used in an electrophysiological study. 3. Our results demonstrate that, in hemisected rats, systemic administration of the adenosine A1 receptor-specific antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) restores, in a dose-dependent manner, phrenic nerve respiratory related output that is lost following hemisection. Furthermore, DPCPX augments respiratory activity in non-injured animals. The A2 receptor agonist CGS-21680 mediates its effects by predominantly acting on peripheral rather than central nervous system (CNS) receptors. CGS-21680 modulates respiratory related phrenic nerve activity in non-injured animals by enhancing tonic activity, but does not induce recovery of phrenic nerve activity in hemisected animals in the majority of cases. When CGS-21680 was administered prior to DPCPX in hemisected rats, the magnitude of recovery of respiratory function was significantly greater than that elicited by DPCPX alone. However, when the A2 receptor agonist was administered after DPCPX, the magnitude of recovery was virtually unchanged, whereas activity in the right phrenic nerve was significantly enhanced. The A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine depressed respiratory activity in non-injured, as well as hemisected, rats. The A2 receptor antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine did not affect respiratory activity. 4. We conclude that while antagonism at central adenosine A1 receptors mediates functional restitution in hemisected animals, activation of A2 receptors located outside of the CNS subserves the A1 receptor-mediated respiratory recovery.","adenosine"

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A1 adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase; or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine A1 receptors.

The present study seeks to extend the previous investigations by contrasting and quantitating the actions of theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline, enprofylline, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline in restoring function 24 h after hemidiaphragm paralysis. The alkylxanthines were selected based on their diverse pharmacologic profiles to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie functional recovery after spinal cord injury. To quantitatively assess the magnitude of recovery, electrophysiological experiments were conducted on pancuronium-paralyzed, hemisected animals under standardized recording conditions. The total absence of respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and paralyzed hemidiaphragm was used as the index of a functionally complete hemisection. Thereafter, drug-induced recovered activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection was quantified and expressed either as a percentage of contralateral phrenic nerve activity in the same animal prior to drug administration or as a percentage of predrug activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals. With either approach, theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced respiratory-related recovered activity. Enprofylline, a potent bronchodilator, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist with limited access to the central nervous system, were ineffective. Maximal recovery was attained with theophylline (15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 mg/kg). At these doses, theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline induced recovery that was 70.0 +/- 2.5 and 69.3 +/- 4.1% of predrug contralateral nerve activity respectively. When expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude changed to 32.9 +/- 4.9 and 35.7 +/- 6.9%, respectively. Involvement of adenosine receptors in the alkylxanthine-induced actions was confirmed in experiments with the adenosine analog, N6 (l-2-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA). It is concluded that central adenosine receptor-mediated mechanisms are implicated in the recovery of respiratory-related activity after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our results suggest a potential for a new therapeutic approach in the rehabilitation of spinal cord patients with respiratory deficits.","adenosine"

Another mechanism of calcium influx during ischemia involves activation of voltage-activated calcium channels, although the efficacy of calcium channel blockers against ischemia-induced damage varies. The purpose of this study was to determine the contributions of the excitotoxic mechanism and of calcium channel activation to metabolic and functional damage to rabbit spinal cord after ischemia induced by occlusion of the abdominal aorta. All metabolic parameters determined (ATP, energy charge, and lactate) completely recovered at 4 days following 20 min of ischemia when NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg given i.v.) or calcium channel blocker KB-2796 (50 mg/kg given i.p.) was administered either prior to or after ischemia. Significant metabolic recovery was also observed after 30 min of ischemia with MK-801 administered before occlusion and KB-2796 given early in recirculation. Similarly, neurologic functions followed by functional performance in the hindlimbs were completely recovered following 20 and 30 min of ischemia and 4 days of recovery. This study demonstrates that although MK-801 or KB-2796 does not prevent paraplegia due to spinal cord ischemia in the rabbit, both drugs can influence the rate of recovery after ischemic injury.","adenosine"

Nalmefene is another opiate-receptor antagonist, but it has substantially greater potency and duration of action than naloxone. It also has increased activity at kappa opiate receptors and has recently been shown to limit histological changes and neurological dysfunction after traumatic spinal cord injury. The present study examined the effects of treatment with nalmefene on outcome after fluid-percussion-induced traumatic brain injury in rats, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor acute metabolic changes and behavioral tests to determine chronic neurological recovery. Single-dose treatment with nalmefene (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) at 30 min after trauma significantly improved (p less than 0.05) neurological outcome (up to 4 weeks) as compared to saline-treated controls. Early changes in intracellular free-magnesium concentration, adenosine diphosphate concentration, and cytosolic phosphorylation potential were all significantly improved by nalmefene treatment, reflecting improved bioenergetic state. We suggest that the ability of nalmefene to improve cellular bioenergetics after trauma may in part account for the neuroprotective effects of this and related compounds.","adenosine"

The present study examined the effects of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker MK-801 on neurochemical sequelae following experimental fluid-percussion brain injury in the rat. Fifteen minutes after fluid-percussion brain injury (2.8 atmospheres), animals received either MK-801 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or saline. MK-801 treatment significantly attenuated the development of focal brain edema at the site of injury 48 h after brain injury, significantly reduced the increase in tissue sodium, and prevented the localized decline in total tissue magnesium that was observed in injured tissue of saline-treated animals. Using phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we also observed that MK-801 treatment improved brain metabolic status and promoted a significant recovery of intracellular free magnesium concentrations that fell precipitously after brain injury. These results suggest that excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters may be involved in the pathophysiological sequelae of traumatic brain injury and that noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists may effectively attenuate some of the potentially deleterious neurochemical sequelae of brain injury.","adenosine"

Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and injured by placing a 190-gm weight on the spinal cord for 5 minutes. Biochemical analysis of the injured segment revealed a significant depletion in the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (P-creatine), and total adenylates for the entire 24-hour recovery period. Glucose levels initially declined, but by 1 hour had normalized, and at 8 and 24 hours were significantly supranormal. The lactate/pyruvate ratio and tissue lactate concentrations increased four and five and half times, respectively, for the first 4 hours after injury. Between 8 and 24 hours, lactate levels remained elevated, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio declined to contol levels as the result of a significant rise in the tissue pyruvate concentration. This sequence of metabolic changes suggested that metabolism was probably not homogeneous throughout the injured segment, and that tissue metabolic rate was depressed for the initial 4 hours after trauma then increased in metabolically active tissue for the remainder of the 24-hour recovery period. This model of spinal cord trauma results in a severe, prolonged ischemia and metabolic injury to the affected tissue. Whether these metabolic changes results from or cause the tissue damage and irreversible paraplegia associated with this type of spinal cord injury remains to be determined.","adenosine"

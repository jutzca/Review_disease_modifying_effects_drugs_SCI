To date, systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) have shown promise in SCI. However, systemic immunosuppression can have detrimental side effects. Therefore, immunomodulatory approaches including the use of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) could represent an attractive alternative. While emerging preclinical data suggests that hIgG is neuroprotective after SCI, the optimal time window of administration and the mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. These knowledge gaps were the focus of this research study. Female adult Wistar rats received a clip compression-contusion SCI at the C7/T1 level of the spinal cord. Injured rats were randomized, in a blinded manner, to receive a single intravenous bolus of hIgG (2 g/kg) or control buffer at 15 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) or 4 h post-SCI. At 24 h and 8 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological and neurobehavioral analyses were undertaken. At all 3 administration time points, hIgG (2 g/kg) resulted in significantly better short-term and long-term outcomes as compared to control buffer. No significant differences were observed when comparing outcomes between the different time points of administration. At 24 h post-injury, hIgG (2 g/kg) administration enhanced the integrity of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) by increasing expression of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in BSCB integrity were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, lower amounts of albumin and Evans Blue in the injured spinal cord and greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. After hIgG (2 g/kg) treatment, there were more neutrophils in the spleen and fewer neutrophils in the blood. hIgG also co-localized with endothelial cell ligands that mediate neutrophil extravasation into the injured spinal cord. Importantly, short-term effects of delayed hIgG (2 g/kg) administration were associated with enhanced tissue and neuron preservation, as well as neurobehavioral and sensory recovery at 8 weeks post-SCI. hIgG (2 g/kg) shows promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by hIgG (2 g/kg) in the injured spinal cord might be explained in twofold. First, hIgG might antagonize neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord by co-localizing with endothelial cell ligands that mediate various steps in neutrophil extravasation. Second, hIgG could traffic neutrophils towards the spleen by increasing expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. Overall, we demonstrate that delayed administration of hIgG (2 g/kg) at 1 and 4-h post-injury enhances short-term and long-term benefits after SCI by modulating local and systemic neuroinflammatory cascades.","albumin"

Six rehabilitation centers across the United States. A secondary analysis of neurological outcomes and serum albumin concentrations was performed on data from the Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation study. Data was accessed from the Archive of Data on Disability to Enable Policy and research (ADDEP). The primary analysis applied unbiased recursive partitioning to examine the relationship between serum albumin, injury severity, and long-term outcomes. The analysis is accessible via https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028 . Serum albumin concentration was significantly associated with lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at admission to rehabilitation. Serum albumin concentrations alone were also significantly associated with change of LEMS and marked recovery (improvement of at least 2 AIS grades and/or recovery to walking) at 1-year post injury. However, after adjusting for admission to rehabilitation LEMS and AIS grade, serum albumin was not significant. The current study partially confirms our previous observations that serum albumin concentrations are associated with neurological outcome after spinal cord injury. As a crude prognostic biomarker, serum albumin concentration could be useful in cases where injury severity cannot be accurately assessed.","albumin"

Albumin-based nanoparticles, which can encapsulate therapeutic drugs and release cargo in a controlled pattern, show high biocompatibility and low toxicity. The Nogo protein, expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes, can inhibit axonal growth by binding with the axonal Nogo receptor (NgR). Peptide NEP1-40, an NgR antagonist, can bind specifically to Nogo, significantly improving functional recovery and axon growth in the corticospinal tract. Therefore, we hypothesized that delivering MP within nanoparticles decorated with NEP1-40 could avoid the disadvantages of free MP and enhance its therapeutic efficacy against SCI. We used human serum albumin to prepare MP-loaded NPs (MP-NPs), to whose surface we conjugated NEP1-40 to form NEP1-40-MP-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated successful formation of nanoparticles. NEP1-40-MP-NPs were taken up significantly better than MP-NPs by the Nogo-positive cell line RSC-96 and were associated with significantly higher Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores in rats recovering from SCI. Micro-computed tomography assay showed that NEP1-40-MP-NPs mitigated SCI-associated loss of bone mineral density and accelerated spinal cord repair. NEP1-40-MP-NPs can enhance the therapeutic effects of MP against SCI. This novel platform may also be useful for delivering other types of drugs.","albumin"

Pressure ulcers are difficult to heal in this population requiring at least six months of bed rest. Surgical treatment (grafting) is the fastest recovery time, but it still requires six weeks of bed rest plus significant additional costs and a high recurrence rate. A significant clinical benefit would be obtained by speeding the healing rate of a non-surgical treatment to close to that of surgical treatment (approximately doubling of healing rate). Current non-surgical treatment is mostly inactive wound coverings. The goal of this project was to look at the feasibility of doubling the healing rate of a full-thickness defect using combinations of three treatments, for the first time, each shown to increase healing rate: application of transforming growth factor-β₃ (TGF-β₃), an albumin based scaffold, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). At one week following surgery, the combined treatment showed the greatest increase in healing rate, particularly for the epithelialization rate. Although the target level of a 100% increase in healing rate over the control was not quite achieved, it is anticipated that the goal would be met with further optimization of the treatment.","albumin"

Medicine has explored therapeutic options for patients with TSCI with the aim to improve their quality of life. One alternative has been the development of biomaterials that offer neuroprotection or neuroregeneration of damaged nerve tissue. The microinjection of iodine-doped polypyrrole particles synthesised by plasma (PPPy/I) has shown neuroprotective effects that favour motor function recovery in experimental animals with TSCI. However, their ability to migrate into the tissue has led to the need to test a suspension vehicle that enables the concentration of particles at the site of injury. To achieve this, two biomaterials of PPPy/I (P1 and P2) were studied. The superficial physicochemical characterisation of the polymers was performed by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle. The rheological performance under oscillatory shear rate of suspensions containing both polymers alone and in combination with bovine serum albumin was also studied. In vivo tests were performed on animals with and without TSCI that were microinjected with particles of P1 or P2 in suspension using a solution of rat serum albumin. Exposure to the protein solutions generates a protein multilayer on the surface of the biomaterials that can drastically change the behaviour of both P1 and P2, which led to severe repercussions in the in vivo assays. The results showed that surface chemistry plays an important role in the performance and that it is possible to treat TSCI with these materials. The interaction of the surface of materials PPPy/I.1 (P1) and PPPy/I.2 (P2) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in a series of changes in the surface chemistry of both biomaterials. The contact angle study (Fig. A) showed the presence of a critical BSA concentration ([BSA]c), in which a monolayer was formed on both polymers and then a stable protein multilayer, as evidenced by the establishment of a plateau in the determination of the contact angle. In vivo tests showed that this interaction may be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), depending on the surface characteristics with or without rat serum albumin (RSA). The TSCI + P1 and TSCI + P2 + RSA groups obtained significant differences in functional recovery compared with the control group according to the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale (BBB).","albumin"

Our objective was to correlate serum albumin levels with spinal cord injury neurological outcomes. We performed a secondary analysis of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (n = 591) participating in the Sygen clinical trial. Serum albumin concentrations were obtained as part of routine blood chemistry analysis, at trial entry (24-72 hours), 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injury. The primary outcomes were ""marked recovery"" and lower extremity motor scores, derived from the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic and linear regression to adjust for potential confounders. Serum albumin was significantly associated with spinal cord injury neurological outcomes. Higher serum albumin concentrations at 1, 2, and 4 weeks were associated with higher 52-week lower extremity motor score. Similarly, the odds of achieving ""marked neurological recovery"" was greater for individuals with higher serum albumin concentrations. The association between serum albumin concentrations and neurological outcomes was independent of initial injury severity, treatment with GM-1, and polytrauma. In spinal cord injury, serum albumin is an independent marker of long-term neurological outcomes. Serum albumin could serve as a feasible biomarker for prognosis at the time of injury and stratification in clinical trials.","albumin"

Previously, we showed that intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the albumin-oleic acid (A-OA) complex in rats with SCI produced partial improvement of these symptoms and that oral 2-hydroxyoleic acid (HOA, a non-hydrolyzable OA analogue), was efficacious in the modulation and treatment of nociception and pain-related anxiety, respectively. Here we observed that intrathecal treatment with the complex albumin-HOA (A-HOA) every 3 days following T9 spinal contusion injury improved locomotor function assessed with the Rotarod and inhibited TA noxious reflex activity in Wistar rats. To investigate the mechanism of action of A-HOA, microarray analysis was carried out in the spinal cord lesion area. Representative genes involved in pain and neuroregeneration were selected to validate the changes observed in the microarray analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Comparison of the expression between healthy rats, SCI rats, and SCI treated with A-HOA rats revealed relevant changes in the expression of genes associated with neuronal morphogenesis and growth, neuronal survival, pain and inflammation. Thus, treatment with A-HOA not only induced a significant overexpression of growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10), tenascin C (TNC), aspirin (ASPN) and sushi-repeat-containing X-linked 2 (SRPX2), but also a significant reduction in the expression of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and phospholipases A1 and A2 (PLA1/2). Currently, SCI has very important unmet clinical needs. A-HOA downregulated genes involved with inflammation and upregulated genes involved in neuronal growth, and may serve to promote recovery of function after experimental SCI.","albumin"

We have studied the endogenous expression of the transcription factors PPARα and LXRβ in the chronic stage after SCI in rats. The immunohistochemical investigation revealed a long lasting increase in the level of PPARα in white matter in the vicinity of the lesion site. The source of this signal was identified in a subpopulation of astrocytes outside of the glial scar area. Intrathecal injections of oleic acid/albumin reduced the lesion-induced PPARα immunoreactivity. In addition, ependymal cells displayed a prominent PPARα signal in the non-injured spinal cord, and continued to express the receptor as they proliferated and migrated within the damaged tissue. The nuclear receptor LXRβ was detected at similar levels after SCI as in sham operated animals. We found high levels of immunoreactivity in the gray matter, while in the white matter it was present in subpopulations of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Macrophages that had accumulated within the center of the lesion contained LXRβ in their cell nuclei. Possible endogenous functions of PPARα and LXRβ after SCI are discussed, specifically the control of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and the regulation of inflammatory reactions.","albumin"

EB-induced VWM demyelination significantly reduced spared VWM and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores persisting out to 2 months. Chronic hindlimb dysfunction was accompanied by a persistent inflammatory response (demonstrated by CD45(+) immunofluorescence) and axonal loss (demonstrated by NF-M immunofluorescence and electron microscopy; EM). These cellular responses differ from the rat where inflammation resolves by 3-4 weeks and axon loss is minimal following EB demyelination. As these data suggest that EB-injection in the mouse spinal cord is a non-remyelinating lesion, we sought to ask whether wheel running could promote recovery by enhancing plasticity of local lumbar circuitry independent of remyelination. This did not occur as BMS and Treadscan assessment revealed no significant effect of wheel running on recovery.

This study was designed to assess axon regeneration and locomotor recovery in rats with spinal cord injury treated with a novel serum-derived albumin scaffold seeded with adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). OECs are considered promising candidates for the treatment of SCI, and ADSCs have the ability to differentiate into neural lineages. In vitro experiments revealed that ADSCs and OECs adhered to the scaffold, remained viable and expressed specific markers of their cell types when cultured in the scaffold. Rats treated with scaffold plus cells showed locomotor skills at several time points from 45 days post-injury that were improved over those recorded in control injured, untreated animals. Astrocytic scars and tissue regeneration, identified using histological and immunohistochemical techniques, revealed that although the scaffold itself appeared to play a significant role in reducing glial scar formation and filling of the lesion cavity with cells, the presence of ADSCs and OECs in the scaffold led to the appearance of cells expressing markers of neurons and axons at the injury site.

Fifty-two rats underwent a T10 dorsal hemisection and were assigned to one of two groups: the vehicle control group (twenty-four rats) or the rhBMP-2 group (twenty-four rats). Within each group, animals were further subdivided according to the follow-up period: one week and six weeks after the lesion. For the acute phase, an additional group of four rats received recombinant human albumin, to account for the cross-species inflammatory response. Postoperatively, locomotor function was assessed on a weekly basis with use of an open field scale and digital footprint analysis. After the animals were killed, they were perfused and the spinal cords analyzed for inflammatory markers, gliosis, and extracellular matrix proteins with use of immunohistochemistry. At one week, there was a significant increase in reactive astrocyte, macrophage-microglia, and fibroblast immunoreactivity around the lesion in the rhBMP-2-treated rats relative to controls. Additionally, there was increased staining for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Similar intergroup morphologic differences persisted at six weeks. Functionally, in the acute phase, rhBMP-2-treated animals demonstrated more open field and fine motor control deficits relative to the controls. By six weeks, both groups had equivalent functional scores, but those treated with rhBMP-2 retained significantly greater paw angle changes than the control animals.

However, the biological significance of KS remains elusive. Here, we addressed the question of whether KS is involved in plasticity after spinal cord injury. Keratanase II (K-II) specifically degraded KS, i.e., not CS, in vivo. This enzyme digestion promoted the recovery of motor and sensory function after spinal cord injury in rats. Consistent with this, axonal regeneration/sprouting was enhanced in K-II-treated rats. K-II and the CS-degrading enzyme chondroitinase ABC exerted comparable effects in vivo and in vitro. However, these two enzymes worked neither additively nor synergistically. These data and further in vitro studies involving artificial proteoglycans (KS/CS-albumin) and heat-denatured or reduced/alkylated proteoglycans suggested that all three components of the proteoglycan moiety, i.e., the core protein, CS chains, and KS chains, were required for the inhibitory activity of proteoglycans.

The gap-junction protein connexin43 (Cx43), which is transiently up-regulated, has been implicated in the spread of 'bystander' damage. We have used an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (asODN) to suppress Cx43 up-regulation in two rat models of spinal cord injury. Within 24 h of compression injury, rats treated with Cx43-asODN scored higher than sense-ODN and vehicle-treated controls on behavioural tests of locomotion. Their spinal cords showed less swelling and tissue disruption, less up-regulation of astrocytic GFAP, and less extravasation of fluorescently-labelled bovine serum albumin and neutrophils. The locomotor improvement was sustained over at least 4 weeks. Following partial spinal cord transection, Cx43-asODN treatment reduced GFAP immunoreactivity, neutrophil recruitment, and the activity of OX42(+) microglia in and around the lesion site. Cx43 has many potential roles in the pathophysiology of CNS injury and may be a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.","albumin"

Normal compounds were used for comparison. SCI was produced by making a longitudinal incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-T11 segments under Equithesin anesthesia. The compounds, either alone or tagged with nanowires, were applied topically within 5 to 10 min after SCI. In these rats, behavioral outcome, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability, edema formation, and cell injury were examined at 5 h after injury. Topical application of normal compounds in high quantity (10 microg in 20 microL) attenuated behavioral dysfunction (3 h after trauma), edema formation, and cell injury, as well as reducing BSCB permeability to Evans blue albumin and (131)I. These beneficial effects are most pronounced with AP713 (SCI-2) treatment. Interestingly, when these compounds were administered in identical conditions after tagging with nanowires, their beneficial effects on functional recovery and spinal cord pathology were further enhanced. However, topical administration of nanowires alone did not influence trauma-induced spinal cord pathology or motor functions. Taken together, our results, probably for the first time, indicate that drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy are enhanced when the compounds are administered with nanowires.","albumin"

The results showed that MPO and caspase-3 activities increased to statistically significant higher levels in the spinal cord after contusion injury comparing to the control group. MPO and caspase-3 enzyme activity levels were significantly reduced in animals treated either with r-Hu-EPO or MPSS.

Various therapeutic molecules, including neurotrophic factors, have improved regeneration and functional recovery after injury when combined with NGCs; however, their impact has not been maximized partly due to the lack of an appropriate drug delivery system. To address this limitation, nerve growth factor (NGF) was incorporated into NGCs of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), P(HEMA-co-MMA). The NGCs were synthesized by a liquid-liquid centrifugal casting process and three different methods of protein incorporation were compared in terms of protein distribution and NGF release profile: (1) NGF was encapsulated (with BSA) in biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) 85/15 microspheres, which were combined with a PHEMA polymerization formulation and coated on the inside of pre-formed NGCs by a second liquid-liquid centrifugal casting technique; (2) pre-formed NGCs were imbibed with a solution of NGF/BSA and (3) NGF/BSA alone was combined with a PHEMA formulation and coated on the inside of pre-formed NGCs by a second liquid-liquid centrifugal casting technique. Using a fluorescently labelled model protein, the distribution of proteins in NGCs prepared with a coating of either protein-loaded microspheres or protein alone was found to be confined to the inner PHEMA layer. Sustained release of NGF was achieved from NGCs with either NGF-loaded microspheres or NGF alone incorporated into the inner layer, but not from channels imbibed with NGF. By day 28, NGCs with microspheres released a total of 220 pg NGF/cm of channel whereas those NGCs imbibed with NGF released 1040 pg/cm and those NGCs with NGF incorporated directly in a PHEMA layer released 8624 pg/cm. The release of NGF from NGCs with microspheres was limited by a slow-degrading microsphere formulation and by the maximum amount of microspheres that could be incorporated into the NGCs structure. Notwithstanding, the liquid-liquid centrifugal casting process is promising for localized and controlled release of multiple factors that are key to tissue regeneration.","albumin"

SCI produced stereotypical sensorimotor deficits resembling the classically described Brown-Seqúard syndrome. Disruption of the BSCB was reflected by increased spinal cord uptake of radiolabeled albumin from blood; this was transient (immediately after SCI) and confined to the lumbar spinal cord. By contrast, specific increase in the entry of TNF alpha was detected in brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord at 1 week after SCI, in addition to its immediate and transient increase consistent with barrier disruption. Lack of a second peak of increase in the entry of IL1 beta further supported the specificity of the TNF alpha response. Moreover, enhanced uptake of radiolabeled TNF alpha was suppressed by excess non-radiolabeled TNF alpha, indicating competition of entry via the known transport system for TNF alpha. Therefore, upregulation of the transport system after SCI probably mediates the increased permeation of TNF alpha across the BSCB. Enhanced entry of TNF alpha at 1 week after SCI was concurrent with sensorimotor and gait improvement of the mouse. We conclude that SCI by lumbar hemisection activates the transport system for TNF alpha at the BBB and suggest that selective permeation of TNF alpha may facilitate functional recovery.","albumin"

This lack of regeneration is crucially influenced by neurite growth inhibitory protein constituents of CNS myelin. We have shown previously that a monoclonal antibody (mAb IN-1) capable of binding and neutralizing Nogo-A, a myelin-associated inhibitor of neurite growth, can induce long-distance axonal regeneration and increased structural plasticity with improved functional recovery in rat models of CNS injury. In this paper we demonstrate that a partially humanized, recombinant Fab fragment (rIN-1 Fab) derived from the original mAb IN-1, was able to promote long-distance regeneration of injured axons in the spinal cord of adult rats. When infused into a spinal cord injury site, regrowth of corticospinal fibers in 11 of 18 animals was observed after a survival time of 2 weeks. Regenerating fibers grew for >9 mm beyond the lesion site and arborized profusely in the distal cord. Regenerated fibers formed terminal arbors with varicosities in the spinal cord gray matter, strongly resembling synaptic points of contact to neurons in the spinal cord distal to the lesion. In animals that had received a bovine serum albumin solution or a recombinant IN-1 fragment that had been mutated in the antigen binding site (mutIN-1 Fab), no significant growth beyond normal lesion-induced sprouting was observed. Neutralization of endogenous nerve growth inhibitors represents a novel use of recombinant antibody technology with potential therapeutic applications after traumatic CNS lesions.","albumin"

To determine if convective delivery could be used in a common animal model to investigate potential therapeutic macromolecules and to examine the effects of trauma on convective delivery in that model, the authors examined the distribution of a macromolecule in naive and traumatized rat spinal cords. Using convection, various infusion volumes ([Vi]; 1, 2, and 4 microl) of 14C-albumin were infused into the dorsal columns of 13 naive and five traumatized rat spinal cords. Volume of distribution (Vd), homogeneity, percentage of recovery, and anatomical location were determined using quantitative autoradiography, scintillation analysis, calculation of kurtosis (K) value, and histological analysis. In the nontraumatized group, Vd was linearly proportional (R2 = 0.98) to Vi (Vd/Vi, 4.3+/-0.6; mean +/- standard deviation), with increases in Vd resulting from linear expansion (R2 = 0.94) primarily in the craniocaudal dimension. In the traumatized spinal cords, the Vd/Vi ratio (3.7+/-0.5) was smaller (p<0.02) and distributions were less confined to the craniocaudal dimension, with significantly larger cross-sectional distributions in the region of injury (p<0.02) compared to the noninjured spinal cords. Histological analysis revealed that after infusion into the dorsal columns, albumin distribution in naive cords was limited to the dorsal white matter, but in the traumatized cords there was penetration into the central gray matter. The distribution of the infusate was homogeneous in the nontraumatized (K = -1.1) and traumatized (K = -1.1) spinal cords. Recovery of radioactivity was not significantly different (p>0.05) between the nontraumatized (84.8+/-6.8%) and traumatized (79.7+/-12.1%) groups. Direct convective delivery of infusate can be used to distribute macromolecules in a predictable, homogeneous manner over significant volumes of naive and traumatized rat spinal cord. These characteristics make it a valuable tool to investigate the therapeutic potential of various compounds for the treatment of injury and spinal cord disease.","albumin"

The authors hypothesized that prevention of leukocyte adhesion during ischemia reperfusion would have beneficial effects and that these effects might be enhanced by a PAF antagonist. To test this hypothesis, rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to severe spinal cord ischemia (25 minutes) followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, at which time either vehicle, antibody against the CD11/CD18 (anti-CD) leukocyte adhesion molecule (1 mg/kg), or the anti-CD and PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (3 mg/kg), was administered intravenously and the animals were monitored for 6.5 hours. Using a score from 0 to 5, recovery of motor function was improved at 5.5 hours by the CD antibody (2.0 +/- 0.5 versus 0.4 +/- 0.2 in the six animals in the vehicle group, p < 0.05). No further improvement was induced by WEB 2086 in the six anti-CD treated animals (1.6 +/- 0.7).

Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to lumbar spinal cord ischemia (25 minutes) and variable periods of reperfusion (30 minutes to 48 hours after ischemia). Regional spinal cord blood flow was monitored by carbon-14-labeled iodoantipyrine autoradiography; vascular permeability was assessed by quantitative microhistofluorescence of Evans blue-albumin in frozen sections of spinal cord. Hindlimb motor function was assessed by standard scoring system and tissue edema by wet/dry weight method. Hindlimb motor function indicated complete paralysis during ischemia and partial gradual recovery upon reperfusion (up to 8 hours), followed by progressive deterioration to severe deficits over 48 hours. Severe vascular permeability disruption was noticed early (30 minutes) after reperfusion, but almost complete recovery reestablished at 8 hours was followed by a secondary progressive increase in vascular permeability. Blood flow was reduced by 20-30% (p less than 0.01) 4 hours after ischemia in the gray matter, but hyperemia (200-300%, p less than 0.01) was observed 12-24 hours after ischemia. Spinal cord water content increased by 5.7% (p less than 0.05) 24 hours after ischemia. This study demonstrates that delayed neurological and motor deterioration after spinal cord ischemia is associated with severe progressive breakdown of spinal cord-blood barrier integrity that develops late (hours) after the injury. Our data suggest that no ischemic insult in early or late reperfusion is associated with delayed motor deterioration.","albumin"

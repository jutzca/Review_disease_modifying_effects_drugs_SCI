Evaluation of neurologic parameters, cortical evoked response and histopathology of the injured spinal cord demonstrated that within the contusion range studied, EACA has no significant therapeutic effect. The ability of the animal to walk was the most reliable criterion indicative of functional recovery, and was closely paralleled by return of the cortical evoked response. Spinal cord cavitation in excess of 60% uniformly resulted in paraplegia. The data from this experiment show no evidence of a significant secondary injury occurring after spinal cord trauma that is amenable to posttraumatic antifibrinolytic therapy.","aminocaproic_acid"

Guanabenz acetate was administered twice daily for 8 weeks. In the first group, the treatment significantly increased blood flow in the abdominal aorta. All cats treated with guanabenz acetate 3 hr after spinal cord contusion had return of micturition and none suffered complete paraplegia. Four animals had partial and the other four had complete motor recovery. A superoxide (O2-.) generating system, horseradish peroxidase, decreased [14C]gamma amino butyric acid uptake by mouse cortical slices by 33% but when superoxide dismutase was added to the medium, the uptake was reduced by only 9%. The nerve endings were also protected by superoxide dismutase from morphologic damage by O2-. as observed by electron microscopy. The agents used in these studies produce their ameliorating effects by virtue of their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and membrane stabilizing properties, and enhancing the regional microcirculation. In addition to having these properties, guanabenz acetate is also an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist.","aminocaproic_acid"

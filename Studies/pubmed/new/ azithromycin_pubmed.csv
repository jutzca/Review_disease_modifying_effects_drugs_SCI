There are limited pharmacological therapies that can drive this reparative inflammatory state. In the current study, we used in vitro systems to comprehensively defined markers of macrophages with known pathological (M1) and reparative (M2) properties in SCI. We then used these markers to objectively define the macrophage activation states after SCI in response to delayed azithromycin treatment. Mice were subjected to moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI. Azithromycin or vehicle was administered beginning 30 minutes post-SCI and then daily for 3 or 7 days post injury (dpi). We detected a dose-dependent polarization toward purportedly protective M2 macrophages with daily AZM treatment. Specifically, AZM doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg decreased M1 macrophage gene expression at 3 dpi while the lowest (10 mg/kg) and highest (160 mg/kg) doses increased M2 macrophage gene expression at 7 dpi. Azithromycin has documented immunomodulatory properties and is commonly prescribed to treat infections in SCI individuals. This work demonstrates the utility of objective, comprehensive macrophage gene profiling for evaluating immunomodulatory SCI therapies and highlights azithromycin as a promising agent for SCI treatment.","azithromycin"

While the alternative, anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype is believed to promote cell protection, regeneration, and plasticity, pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages persist after SCI and contribute to protracted cell and tissue loss. Thus, identifying non-invasive, clinically viable, pharmacological therapies for altering macrophage phenotype is a challenging, yet promising, approach for treating SCI. Azithromycin (AZM), a commonly used macrolide antibiotic, drives anti-inflammatory macrophage activation in rodent models of inflammation and in humans with cystic fibrosis. We hypothesized that AZM treatment can alter the macrophage response to SCI and reduce progressive tissue pathology. To test this hypothesis, mice (C57BL/6J, 3-month-old) received daily doses of AZM (160 mg/kg) or vehicle treatment via oral gavage for 3 days prior and up to 7 days after a moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI (75-kdyn force injury). Fluorescent-activated cell sorting was used in combination with real-time PCR (rtPCR) to evaluate the disposition and activation status of microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils, as well as macrophage phenotype in response to AZM treatment. An open-field locomotor rating scale (Basso Mouse Scale) and gridwalk task were used to determine the effects of AZM treatment on SCI recovery. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were used to determine the effect of AZM treatment on macrophage phenotype in vitro. In accordance with our hypothesis, SCI mice exhibited significantly increased anti-inflammatory and decreased pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in response to AZM treatment. In addition, AZM treatment led to improved tissue sparing and recovery of gross and coordinated locomotor function. Furthermore, AZM treatment altered macrophage phenotype in vitro and lowered the neurotoxic potential of pro-inflammatory, M1 macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that pharmacologically intervening with AZM can alter SCI macrophage polarization toward a beneficial phenotype that, in turn, may potentially limit secondary injury processes. Given that pro-inflammatory macrophage activation is a hallmark of many neurological pathologies and that AZM is non-invasive and clinically viable, these data highlight a novel approach for treating SCI and other maladaptive neuroinflammatory conditions.","azithromycin"

However, the pro-inflammatory, pathological macrophage activation state predominates and contributes to progressive neurodegeneration. Azithromycin (AZM), an FDA approved macrolide antibiotic, has been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory properties in a variety of inflammatory conditions. Indeed, we previously observed that post-SCI AZM treatment reduces pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Further, a combined pre- and post-injury treatment paradigm improved functional recovery from SCI. Therefore, for the current study, we hypothesize that post-injury AZM treatment will improve recovery from SCI. To test this hypothesis, we examined the therapeutic potential of delayed AZM treatment on locomotor, sensory, and anatomical recovery. We administered AZM beginning 30-min, 3-h, or 24-h following contusion SCI in female mice, and then daily for 7 days. AZM administration beginning 30-min and 3-h post-injury improved locomotor recovery with increased stepping function relative to vehicle controls. Further, delaying treatment for 30-min after SCI significantly reduced lesion pathology. Initiating AZM treatment 24-h post-injury was not therapeutically effective. Regardless of the timing of the initial treatment, AZM did not statistically reduce the development of neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia) nor increase neuron survival. Collectively, these results add to a growing body of evidence supporting AZM's translational potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI and other neuroinflammatory conditions in which patients currently have very few options.","azithromycin"

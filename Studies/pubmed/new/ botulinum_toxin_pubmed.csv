It is clinically recognized as a phenomenon of velocity-dependent increase in resistance, i.e., hypertonia. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of spasticity improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying this complex phenomenon and its relations to other components of UMN syndrome (weakness and disordered motor control), as well as the resultant clinical problems. This theoretical framework provides a foundation to set up treatment goals and to guide goal-oriented clinical assessment and treatment. Among a spectrum of treatment options, botulinum toxin (BoNT) therapy is the preferred treatment for focal spasticity. The evidence is very robust that BoNT therapy effectively reduces spasticity; however, it does not improve voluntary movement. In this chapter, we highlight a few issues on how to achieve the best clinical outcomes of BoNT therapy, such as dosing, dilution, guidance techniques, adjunctive therapies, early treatment, repeated injections, and central effects, as well as the ways to improve motor function in selected subgroups of patients with spasticity. We also discuss the reasons of poor responses to BoNT therapy and when not to use BoNT therapy.","botulinum_toxin"

Spasticity could be associated with pain, high disability, poor functional recovery, and reduced quality of life. Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) is considered a first-line treatment for spasticity and, more recently, it also represents a therapeutic option for various chronic pain conditions. In this open label study, we aim to evaluate the effect of the BoNT-A on the spinal nociception in patients affected by spasticity of the lower limbs with associated pain with predominantly neuropathic features. Ten patients with stroke, 10 with multiple sclerosis and 5 with spinal cord injury were enrolled in the study. They were tested with clinical scales (neuropathic pain scale inventory (NPSI), numerical rating scale (NRS), modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and with the nociceptive withdrawal reflex at lower limbs to explore the spinal temporal summation threshold at baseline and 30 day after BoNT-A injection. OnabotulinumtoxinA (50 to 200 units per site) was injected in the lower limb muscles according to the distribution of spasticity. No significant differences were found at baseline for neurophysiological features across groups. After the BoNT-A injection, we recorded a significant reduction in MAS and NRS scores. Regarding the neurophysiological parameters, we described a significant increase in the temporal summation threshold after the BoNT-A injection. Our data supports the hypothesis that peripherally injected OnabotulinumtoxinA modulates the excitability of spinal cord nociceptive pathways. This activity may take place irrespective of the effect of the drug on spasticity.","botulinum_toxin"

This review was performed according to the methodology recommended by the Joint SIU-ICUD International Consultation. Embase and Medline databases were used to identify literature relevant to the early urological care of SCI patients. Recommendations were developed by consensus and graded using a modified Oxford system which identifies level of evidence (LOE) and grade of recommendation (GOR). Clinicians must ensure appropriate bladder emptying immediately after SCI (LOE 3, GOR A) and perform the initial neuro-urological assessment within 3Â months after injury (LOE 3, GOR A), including history, validated questionnaires, bladder diary, physical examination, measurement of renal function, and urinary tract imaging (LOE 4, GOR B). Urodynamics, if available video-urodynamics, must be performed to detect and specify lower urinary tract dysfunction (LOE 1, GOR A). Spontaneous voiding and/or intermittent catheterization must be considered in appropriate patients once they are medically stable (LOE 3, GOR A). Antimuscarinics are the first-line and intradetrusor botulinum toxin A injections are the second-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity (LOE 1, GOR A). Irreversible surgical interventions should be delayed until the second year after injury due to the potential for neurological recovery (LOE 4, GOR B). Careful clinical assessment and pertinent urological testing including urodynamic investigation are necessary for appropriate counselling and treatment of new SCI patients.","botulinum_toxin"

Herein, rats with incomplete thoracic (T10) spinal cord injuries (SCI) with a dual spinal lesion model were subjected to four weeks of treadmill training and then were treated with complete spinal transection at T8. We found that treadmill training allowed the retention of hind limb motor function after incomplete SCI, even with a heavy load after complete spinal transection. Moreover, treadmill training alleviated the secondary injury in distal lumbar spinal motor neurons, and enhanced BDNF/TrkB expression in the lumbar spinal cord. To discover the influence of skeletal muscle contractile activity on motor function and gene expression, we adopted botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to block the neuromuscular activity of the rat gastrocnemius muscle. BTX-A treatment inhibited the effects of treadmill training on motor function and BDNF/TrKB expression. These results indicated that treadmill training through the skeletal muscle-motor nerve-spinal cord retrograde pathway regulated neuralplasticity in the mammalian central nervous system, which induced the expression of related neurotrophins and promoted motor function recovery.","botulinum_toxin"

Neuropathic pain (NP) results from a dysfunction and derangement in the transmission and signal processing along the nervous system and it is a recognized disease in itself. The prevalence of NP is estimated to be between 6.9% and 10% in the general population. This condition can complicate the recovery from stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord lesions, and several neuropathies promoting persistent disability and poor quality of life. Subjects suffering from NP describe it as burning, itching, lancing, and numbness, but hyperalgesia and allodynia represent the most bothersome symptoms. The management of NP is a clinical challenge and several non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions have been proposed with variable benefits. Botulinum toxin (BTX) as an adjunct to other interventions can be a useful therapeutic tool for the treatment of disabled people. Although BTX-A is predominantly used to reduce spasticity in a neuro-rehabilitation setting, it has been used in several painful conditions including disorders characterized by NP. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms that operate in reducing pain are still unclear and include blocking nociceptor transduction, the reduction of neurogenic inflammation by inhibiting neural substances and neurotransmitters, and the prevention of peripheral and central sensitization. Some neurological disorders requiring rehabilitative intervention can show neuropathic pain resistant to common analgesic treatment. This paper addresses the effect of BTX-A in treating NP that complicates frequent disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system such as spinal cord injury, post-stroke shoulder pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy, which are commonly managed in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, BTX-A has an effect in relief pain that may characterize less common neurological disorders including post-traumatic neuralgia, phantom limb, and complex regional pain syndrome with focal dystonia. The use of BTX-A could represent a novel therapeutic strategy in caring for neuropathic pain whenever common pharmacological tools have been ineffective. However, large and well-designed clinical trials are needed to recommend BTX-A use in the relief of neuropathic pain.","botulinum_toxin"

Twenty-six patients, 15 women and 11 men, mean age 40.8âÂ±â12.7 years old, in whom a first injection of 750âU abobotulinum toxin in 20 sites failed in treating neurogenic detrusor overactivity, received onabotulinum toxin 300âU detrusor injections in 30 sites. Neurologic conditions were spinal cord injury in 14 cases, multiple sclerosis in nine, myelomeningocele in two and myelitis in one. Mean time between the two injections was 5.6âÂ±â1.4 months. Before and 6 weeks after each injection, patients carried out a 3-day bladder diary and had urodynamics. The success was defined as the combination of a clean intermittent self-catheterization number under 8 per 24âhr, urgency, urinary incontinence and detrusor overactivity relief. Out of 26 patients, the second injection was successful in 15 (57.7%). While the first injection of 750âU abobotulinum toxin had no impact at all, after 300âU onabotulinum toxin injection, the number of clean intermittent self-catheterization decreased significantly (11.3âÂ±â2.1 vs. 6.4âÂ±â1.9, Pâ=â0.01), 17/26 (65.4%) patients achieved continence, urgency was relieved in 18/26 (69.2%) and detrusor overactivity in 15/26 (57.7%). In case of failure after a first detrusor injection of abobotulinum toxin, switching for onabotulinum toxin is efficient. Further investigations should be performed to assess whether the replacement of onabotulinum toxin by abobotulinum toxin provides the same results.","botulinum_toxin"

Results from all studies were then pooled using a random-effects model. Treatment effect sizes were interpreted as small, >0.2; moderate, >0.5; or large, >0.8. Fourteen studies representing data from 734 subjects were included. After BTX-A injection, large treatment effects were observed in postvoid residual urine volume, reflex detrusor volume, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, and catheterization frequency (P<.01). Rate of incontinence episodes was reduced from 23% to 1.31% after BTX-A treatment. No significant decrease in max flow rate was observed (P=.403). Results of the meta-analysis indicate BTX-A is effective in treating NDO after SCI. The use of BTX-A was associated with a decrease in incontinence episodes, catheter use, and bladder pressures.","botulinum_toxin"

Spinal cord injury (SCI) interrupts these neuronal circuits and jeopardizes the voluntary control of bladder function. In most cases, SCI results in a period of bladder areflexia, followed by the emergence of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). Only recently, researchers have started to have a clearer vision of the mechanisms of SCI-induced changes affecting LUT control. For example, changes in the urothelium have recently been described and proposed to play a role in NDO. As such, a better understanding of NDO has generated new opportunities to investigate novel therapeutic approaches for NDO. In the present paper, we aim to update recent data concerning SCI-induced LUT dysfunction and therapeutic approaches commonly used to deal with NDO. We make a brief description of LUT control and changes occurring after SCI, and refer to new therapeutic options, including vanniloids and botulinum toxin. Finally, we discuss mechanisms of spinal cord repair, an interesting and very active area of investigation that has obtained some promising results in the recovery of LUT control.","botulinum_toxin"

Charts of 28 adults receiving BTX were reviewed. All patients received BTX type A. Dosages of BTX ranged from 10 to 119 units per muscle. Improvement was noted for 56% in ambulation and 71% in positioning. Overall, upper-extremity function improved in 78%, hygiene improved in 66.6%, and pain decreased in 83.3%.

Compensatory reinnervation occurs within those SOMs by acquiring synaptic sprouts from whatever neurons in the neighborhood. Such reorganizations are more often maladaptive than beneficial. Motor recovery, if any appears, is incomplete and compromised. Cognitive systems studies indicate that motor paralysis is due to loss of learning <--> recall balance in those compensated SOMs, which had been locked into a stability <--> plasticity dilemma. Treatment/rehabilitation should aim therefore to first restore this learning related balance. The use of botulinum toxin as a neuromotor relearning tool to improve motor recovery is discussed.","botulinum_toxin"

But what are the prospects for quadriplegics? Certain fundamental issues make treatment approaches to quadriplegia different and difficult. Injury at cervical region poses additional problems for any surgical intervention with life-threatening risks of i) endangering respiratory function, ii) cavitation, cysts, and syringomyelia formation extending cephalad to the injury, and iii) mid-lower cervical injuries, lower motor neuron death, and the resultant degeneration of brachial plexus axons would still leave the upper limbs denervated and paralyzed even as treatment procedures might successfully salvage the lower limbs. With these apparently insurmountable impediments in quadriplegic cord repair, it would be wise to turn to alternative treatment strategies. Conventional treatment models since the days of Ralph Gerard (1940) have all used intra-vertebral procedures. We present here a plausible extra-vertebral repair model suitable for incomplete cord injuries at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. The procedure consists of identifying the extent of viable grey-white matter in the injured area and to utilize it efficiently as a ""neural tissue bridge."" Next, labile state is induced by using botulinum toxin/colchicine (Krishnan, 1983, 1991; Krishnan et al., 2001 a,b) and Ca+ channel blockers in the motorsensory nerve terminals of polisegmentally innervated skeletal muscles that ""bridge"" the injured cord segments. This would retrogradely induce a redundant state of intra-spinal growth of nerve terminals and new synaptic connections within those viable neural tissues, as well as promote effective relinking of the injured cord ends and enhance motor-sensory recovery.","botulinum_toxin"

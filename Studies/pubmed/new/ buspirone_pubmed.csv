Herein, we compare the effects of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on forelimb motor function recovery after a C4 bilateral dorsal funiculi crush in adult female rats. After injury, single pellet reaching performance and forelimb muscle activity decreased in all rats. From 1 to 6 weeks after injury, rats were tested on these tasks with and without buspirone (1-2 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (1-5 mg/kg). Reaching and grasping success rates of buspirone-treated rats improved rapidly within 2 weeks after injury and plateaued over the next 4 weeks of testing. Electromyography (EMG) from selected muscles in the dominant forelimb showed that buspirone-treated animals used new reaching strategies to achieve success after the injury. However, forelimb performance dramatically decreased within 2 weeks of buspirone withdrawal. In contrast, fluoxetine treatment resulted in a more progressive rate of improvement in forelimb performance over 8 weeks after injury. Neither buspirone nor fluoxetine significantly improved quadrupedal locomotion on the horizontal ladder test. The improved accuracy of reaching and grasping, patterns of muscle activity, and increased excitability of spinal motor-evoked potentials after buspirone administration reflect extensive reorganization of connectivity within and between supraspinal and spinal sensory-motor netxcopy works. Thus, both serotonergic drugs, buspirone and fluoxetine, neuromodulated these networks to physiological states that enabled markedly improved forelimb function after cervical spinal cord injury.","buspirone"

Previous studies in animal models with SCI have demonstrated a promising recovery in respiratory and phrenic nerve activity post-injury induced by the systemic and local administration of serotonin receptor agonists such as Buspirone and Trazodone. Human trials must be performed to determine whether individuals with SCI respond similarly. We hypothesized that Buspirone and Trazodone would decrease the propensity to hypocapnic CSA during sleep. We studied eight males with chronic SCI and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [age: 48.8 ± 14.2 yr; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 44.9 ± 23.1] in a single-blind crossover design. For 13 days, participants were randomly assigned either Buspirone (7.5-15 mg twice daily), Trazodone (100 mg), or a placebo followed by a 14-day washout period before crossing over to the other interventions. Study nights included polysomnography and induction of CSA using a noninvasive ventilation protocol. We assessed indexes of SDB, CO2 reserve, apneic threshold (AT), controller gain (CG), plant gain (PG), and ventilatory parameters. CO2 reserve was significantly widened on Buspirone (-3.6 ± 0.9 mmHg) compared with both Trazodone (-2.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.009) and placebo (-1.8 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.001) but not on Trazodone vs. placebo (P = 0.061). CG was significantly decreased on Buspirone compared with placebo (1.8 ± 0.4 vs. 4.0 ± 2.0 L/(mmHg·min), P = 0.025) but not on Trazodone compared with placebo (2.5 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0 ± 2.0 L/(mmHg·min); P = 0.065). There were no significant differences for PG, AT, or any SDB indexes (AHI, obstructive apnea index, central apnea index, oxygen desaturation index). The administration of Buspirone decreased the susceptibility to induced hypocapnic central apnea by reducing chemosensitivity and increasing CO2 reserve in chronic SCI patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research study is novel as it is the first study in a humans that we are aware of that demonstrates the ability of Buspirone to increase CO2 reserve and hence decrease susceptibility to hypocapnic central apnea in patients with spinal cord injury.","buspirone"

Lately, United States Food and Drug Administration-approved buspirone has shown promise and promoted locomotor-like movement occurrence in SCL patients, but evidence on how and where it exerts its effects is lacking. The objective of the present study was, first, to verify buspirone effect on locomotor spinal network and to evaluate if it promoted functional recovery when combined with training. Also, we evaluated buspirone impact on locomotion in mice that had recovered from a previous hemisection before sustaining the spinal transection. This dual lesion paradigm has allowed confirmation of spinal network involvement in recovery after an incomplete SCL. Buspirone acutely increased the number of steps taken, the coupling strength between hindlimbs, angular excursion of the hip joint during locomotion, and improved paw positioning at contact and paw drag (ps < 0.05). Moreover, it induced long-lasting improvements of paw positioning at contact and paw drag when combined with training in mice after a dual lesion paradigm. Altogether, the results indicate that buspirone exerts considerable acute facilitation of spinally mediated locomotion, and could be used in combination with training to promote functional recovery after SCL.","buspirone"

The authors identified a combination pharmacotherapy using buspirone, carbidopa, and L-DOPA (BCD) that elicits bouts of locomotor-like movements in spinal cord-transected (Tx) mice. They then evaluated the effects of 8 weeks of treadmill training in Tx mice that received BCD or BCD + clenbuterol, a monoaminergic agent with anabolic properties, on locomotor function, muscle atrophy, adipose tissue loss, and bone density measures. Induced locomotor movement, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and femoral bone properties were compared in unoperated control mice, operated controls (untreated, untrained Tx mice), and 2 groups of treated, trained Tx mice (Tx + BCD, Tx + BCD + clenbuterol) that also received training. BCD- and BCD + clenbuterol-treated mice showed comparable levels of locomotor movements that significantly improved over time. Soleus muscle mass and soleus and extensor digitorum longus cross-sectional area significantly increased in both groups of BCD-treated mice, with greater effects in BCD + clenbuterol-treated animals. Fiber type conversion, adipose tissues, bone mineral density, and content were reduced in all Tx groups compared with unoperated control mice. These findings suggest that locomotor movement and muscle properties can be restored to near-normal levels after several weeks of BCD treatment, regular training, and clenbuterol in completely paraplegic animals.","buspirone"

Here, we report a C5 hemicontusion SCI model in rats with abnormalities that emulate human post-SCI pathophysiology, including spontaneous recovery processes. Post-C5 SCI rats demonstrated deficits in minute ventilation (Ve) responses to a 7% CO2 challenge that correlated significantly with lesion severities (no injury or 12.5, 25, or 50 mm x 10 g weight drop; New York University impactor; p < 0.001) and ipsilateral motor neuron loss (p = 0.016). Importantly, C5 SCI resulted in at least 4 weeks of respiratory abnormalities that ultimately recovered afterward. Because serotonin is involved in respiration-related neuroplasticity, we investigated the impact of activating 5-HT1A receptors on post-C5 SCI respiratory dysfunction. Treatment with the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylmino)tetralin (8-OH DPAT) (250 microg/kg, i.p.) restored hypercapnic Ve at 2 and 4 weeks after injury (i.e., approximately 39.2% increase vs post-SCI baseline; p < or = 0.033). Improvements in hypercapnic Ve response after single administration of 8-OH DPAT were dose dependent and lasted for approximately 4 h(p < or = 0.038 and p < or = 0.024, respectively). Treatment with another 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), replicated the results, whereas pretreatment with a 5-HT1A-specific antagonist, 4-iodo-N-[2-[4(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-benzamide (3 mg/kg, i.p.) given 20 min before 8-OH DPAT negated the effect of 8-OH DPAT. These results imply a potential clinical use of 5-HT1A agonists for post-SCI respiratory disorders.","buspirone"

Calcitriol (1 μg/kg) treatment for 7 consecutive days after SCI was compared SCI control and Sham control rat groups. Calcitriol-treated group had significantly improved outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control, which was confirmed by increased ventral horn motor neurons in Calcitriol-treated group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that calcitriol injection has a significant regulatory effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to control SCI groups, which was associated with significant reduction in IFN-γ and IL-17A secretion and leukocyte infiltration into injury site. Along with confirmation of immunoregulatory aspects of Calcitriol treatment against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that reducing the extent of progressive tissue loss by Calcitriol therapy in acute phase, could result in better recovery after SCI.","calcitriol"

To evaluate the effects of calcitriol on oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy and locomotor recovery in rats after spinal cord injury (SCI). China. Ninety female rats were randomly divided into three groups. Laminectomy only was performed in the control group. The SCI group received laminectomy as well as spinal cord compression injury. In the calcitriol group, SCI rats received an intraperitoneal injection of calcitriol (2 μg kg(-1)day(-1)). Oxidative stress was assessed by the tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the contents of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA). The extent of apoptosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry for C-caspase3, TUNEL staining and western blotting for C-caspase3, Bax and Bcl2. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine autophagosomes in the injured spinal cord of calcitriol-treated rats. Autophagy was detected by western blotting for LC3-II, Beclin1 and p62. Histological changes were assessed by haematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. Functional recovery was reflected by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotion rating scale and the inclined plane test. With calcitriol treatment, oxidative stress was decreased, SOD activity and GSH content were increased and MDA content was decreased. Moreover, apoptosis was inhibited in the SCI plus calcitriol group. However, a higher level of autophagy was detected in the lesions of the calcitriol group compared with the SCI group. Histological damage and neuron loss after SCI were reduced in calcitriol-treated rats, and functional recovery was significantly promoted in the calcitriol group compared with controls. Calcitriol promotes locomotor recovery after SCI by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis, as well as promoting autophagy.","calcitriol"

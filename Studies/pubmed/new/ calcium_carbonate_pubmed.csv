To achieve this sustained release, anti-NogoA is typically delivered by osmotic minipumps; however, external minipumps are susceptible to infection. To address this issue, we developed a drug delivery system that consists of anti-NogoA-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles dispersed in a hydrogel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (composite HAMC). To optimize in vitro release, we screened formulations for improved anti-NogoA bioactivity and sustained release based on combinations of co-encapsulated trehalose, hyaluronan, MgCO(3), and CaCO(3). Co-encapsulated MgCO(3) and CaCO(3) slowed the rate of anti-NogoA release and did not influence anti-NogoA bioactivity. Co-encapsulated trehalose significantly improved anti-NogoA bioactivity at early release time points by stabilizing the protein during lyophilization. Co-encapsulated trehalose with hyaluronan improved bioactivity up to 28d and dramatically increased the rate and duration of sustained delivery. The sustained release of bioactive anti-NogoA from composite HAMC is a compelling formulation for in vivo evaluation in a model of spinal cord injury.","calcium_carbonate"

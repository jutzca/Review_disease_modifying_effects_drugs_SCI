The vagus nerve contains mechano- and chemosensory fibers as well as the motor fibers necessary for the central nervous system (CNS) control of GI reflexes. Cell bodies for the vagal afferent fibers are located within the nodose gangla (NG) and the majority of vagal afferent axons are unmyelinated C fibers that are sensitive to capsaicin through activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels. Vagal afferent fibers also express receptors for GI hormones, including cholecystokinin (CCK). Previously, T3-SCI provokes a transient GI inflammatory response as well as a reduction of both gastric emptying and centrally-mediated vagal responses to GI peptides, including CCK. TRPV1 channels and CCK-A receptors (CCKar) expressed in vagal afferents are upregulated in models of visceral inflammation. The present study investigated whether T3-SCI attenuates peripheral vagal afferent sensitivity through plasticity of TRPV1 and CCK receptors. Vagal afferent response to graded mechanical stimulation of the stomach was significantly attenuated by T3-SCI at 3-day and 3-week recovery. Immunocytochemical labeling for CCKar and TRPV1 demonstrated expression on dissociated gastric-projecting NG neurons. Quantitative assessment of mRNA expression by qRT-PCR revealed significant elevation of CCKar and TRPV1 in the whole NG following T3-SCI in 3-day recovery, but levels returned to normal after 3-weeks. Three days after injury, systemic administration of CCK-8 s showed a significantly diminished gastric vagal afferent response in T3-SCI rats compared to control rats while systemic capsaicin infusion revealed a significant elevation of vagal response in T3-SCI vs control rats. These findings demonstrate that T3-SCI provokes peripheral remodeling and prolonged alterations in the response of vagal afferent fibers to the physiological signals associated with digestion.","capsaicin"

Nociceptive sensory input is capable of altering motor output at the spinal level, and nociceptive neurons are sensitized after SCI. Here we tested the hypotheses that stretch-induced locomotor deficits are dependent on nociceptive afferents by depleting TRPV1+ sensory afferents using capsaicin injections in neonatal rats. Following maturation, animals received 25g-cm contusive SCI at T10. After plateau of locomotor recovery at 6 weeks, daily stretching was performed for 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without stretch, and again for two additional weeks. Animals were sacrificed 2 h after the last stretching session for histological assessments. Consistent with previous findings, stretch-induced drops in locomotor function were observed in nociceptor-intact animals but were nearly absent in nociceptor-depleted animals. These functional changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in the number of c-Fos+ nuclei throughout the lumbar enlargement. As expected, nociceptor-depleted animals had very little CGRP+ axonal innervation of the dorsal horn. Nociceptor-intact stretched animals had significantly higher levels of CGRP+ as compared to non-stretched SCI rats, suggesting that stretching promoted intraspinal CGRP+ sprouting. These results indicate that stretch-induced locomotor dysfunction in animals with incomplete SCI involves C-fibers, adding a negative post-SCI role to their adaptive roles (e.g., bladder control), and suggesting that the clinical use of muscle stretching to combat contractures and spasticity may be unintentionally detrimental to locomotor function.","capsaicin"

Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury.","capsaicin"

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death.","capsaicin"

Following chronic cervical spinal cord injury, bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation-induced inhibition of phrenic activity was exaggerated. Supersensitivity of phrenic motor outputs to the inhibitory effect of bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation is due to a shift of phrenic motoneuron types and slow recovery of phrenic motoneuron discharge in cervical spinal cord-injured animals. These data suggest that activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibres may retard phrenic output recovery following cervical spinal cord injury. The alteration of phenotype and discharge pattern of phrenic motoneuron enables us to understand the impact of spinal cord injury on spinal respiratory activity. Cervical spinal injury interrupts bulbospinal pathways and results in cessation of phrenic bursting ipsilateral to the lesion. The ipsilateral phrenic activity can partially recover over weeks to months following injury due to the activation of latent crossed spinal pathways and exhibits a greater capacity to increase activity during respiratory challenges than the contralateral phrenic nerve. However, whether the bilateral phrenic nerves demonstrate differential responses to respiratory inhibitory inputs is unclear. Accordingly, the present study examined bilateral phrenic bursting in response to capsaicin-induced pulmonary chemoreflexes, a robust respiratory inhibitory stimulus. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated adult rats at 8-9 weeks after C2 hemisection (C2Hx) or C2 laminectomy. Intra-jugular capsaicin (1.5 μg kg-1 ) injection was performed to activate the bronchopulmonary C-fibres to evoke pulmonary chemoreflexes. The present results indicate that capsaicin-induced prolongation of expiratory duration was significantly attenuated in C2Hx animals. However, ipsilateral phrenic activity was robustly reduced after capsaicin treatment compared to uninjured animals. Single phrenic fibre recording experiments demonstrated that C2Hx animals had a higher proportion of late-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons that were relatively sensitive to capsaicin treatment compared to early-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons. Moreover, late-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons in C2Hx animals had a weaker discharge frequency and slower recovery time than uninjured animals. These results suggest bilateral phrenic nerves differentially respond to bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation following unilateral cervical hemisection, and the severe inhibition of phrenic bursting is due to a shift in the discharge pattern of phrenic motoneurons.","capsaicin"

The pulmonary chemoreflex evoked by activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibers has been reported to be abolished in animals with acute cervical hemisection (C2Hx). The present study examined whether the pulmonary chemoreflex can recover during the chronic injury phase and investigated the role of bronchopulmonary C-fibers on the altered breathing pattern after C2Hx. In the first protocol, bronchopulmonary C-fibers were excited by intrajugular capsaicin administration in uninjured and complete C2Hx animals 8 wk postsurgery. Capsaicin evoked pulmonary chemoreflexes in both groups, but the reflex intensity was significantly weaker in C2Hx animals. To examine whether spared spinal white matter tissue contributes to pulmonary chemoreflex recovery, the reflex was evaluated in animals with different extents of lateral injury. Linear regression analyses revealed that tidal volume significantly correlated with the extent of spared tissue; however, capsaicin-induced apnea was not related to injury severity when the ipsilateral-to-contralateral white matter ratio was <50%. In the second protocol, the influence of background bronchopulmonary C-fiber activity on respiration was investigated by blocking C-fiber conduction via perivagal capsaicin treatment. The rapid shallow breathing of C2Hx animals persisted after perivagal capsaicin treatment despite attenuation of pulmonary chemoreflexes. These results indicate that the pulmonary chemoreflex can recover to some extent following spinal injury, but remains attenuated even when there is moderate spinal tissue sparing, and that altered breathing pattern of C2Hx animals cannot be attributed to endogenous activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibers.","capsaicin"

Our work shows that these relations can have a lasting effect on spinal plasticity, inducing a form of learning that alters the effect of subsequent nociceptive stimuli. The capacity of lower spinal systems to adapt, in the absence of brain input, is examined in spinally transected rats that receive a nociceptive shock to the tibialis anterior muscle of one hind leg. If shock is delivered whenever the leg is extended (controllable stimulation), it induces an increase in flexion duration that minimizes net shock exposure. This learning is not observed in subjects that receive the same amount of shock independent of leg position (uncontrollable stimulation). These two forms of stimulation have a lasting, and divergent, effect on subsequent learning: controllable stimulation enables learning whereas uncontrollable stimulation disables it (learning deficit). Uncontrollable stimulation also enhances mechanical reactivity. We review evidence that training with controllable stimulation engages a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent process that can both prevent and reverse the consequences of uncontrollable shock. We relate these effects to changes in BDNF protein and TrkB signaling. Controllable stimulation is also shown to counter the effects of peripheral inflammation (from intradermal capsaicin). A model is proposed that assumes nociceptive input is gated at an early sensory stage. This gate is sensitive to current environmental relations (between proprioceptive and nociceptive input), allowing stimulation to be classified as controllable or uncontrollable. We further propose that the status of this gate is affected by past experience and that a history of uncontrollable stimulation will promote the development of neuropathic pain.","capsaicin"

Literature review of anatomical, immunohistochemical, and pharmacologic studies of normal and dysfunctional bladder afferent pathways. Studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through coordination centers (periaqueductal gray and pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brain stem. This reflex pathway, which is activated by small myelinated (Adelta) bladder afferent nerves, is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Spinal cord injury at cervical or thoracic levels disrupts voluntary voiding, as well as the normal reflex pathways that coordinate bladder and sphincter function. Following spinal cord injury, the bladder is initially areflexic but then becomes hyperreflexic due to the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. The recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury is dependent in part on the plasticity of bladder afferent pathways and the unmasking of reflexes triggered by unmyelinated, capsaicin-sensitive, C-fiber bladder afferent neurons. Plasticity is associated with morphologic, chemical, and electrical changes in bladder afferent neurons and appears to be mediated in part by neurotrophic factors released in the spinal cord and the peripheral target organs. Spinal cord injury at sites remote from the lumbosacral spinal cord can indirectly influence properties of bladder afferent neurons by altering the function and chemical environment in the bladder or the spinal cord.","capsaicin"

This neural system coordinates the activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract: (1) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (2) an outlet (consisting of bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the pelvic floor). During urine storage the outlet is closed and the bladder is quiescent, thereby maintaining a low intravesical pressure over a wide range of bladder volumes. During micturition the outlet relaxes and the bladder contracts to promote the release of urine. This reciprocal relationship between bladder and outlet is generated by visceral reflex circuits, some of which are under voluntary control. Experimental studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination center (the pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brainstem.

This report describes changes in micturition reflexes 2 h to 14 weeks following spinal cord transection at the lower thoracic level. In acute spinal cats micturition reflexes were blocked, however, several weeks after transection, a long latency (180-200 ms) spinal reflex could be activated by C-fiber bladder afferents. This reflex was blocked by capsaicin in doses (20-30 mg/kg, s.c.) that did not affect micturition reflexes in intact cats. Micturition reflexes were unmasked in acute spinal and facilitated in chronic spinal cats by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Spinal neurons and axons containing opioid peptides were more prominent below the level of transection in chronic spinal cats. VIP, a putative neurotransmitter in C-fiber bladder afferents, inhibited micturition reflexes when injected intrathecally (2-10 micrograms) in intact cats but facilitated micturition reflexes in spinal cats (doses 0.1-1 micrograms, i.t.). VIP-containing C-fiber afferent projections to lamina I of the sacral spinal cord expanded in spinal cats. Thus VIP afferents may have an important role in the recovery of bladder reflexes after spinal injury. Paraplegic animals also exhibit bladder-sphincter dyssynergia, which causes functional outlet obstruction. Studies in rats have revealed that outlet obstruction induced by partial urethral ligation facilitates spinal micturition reflex pathways and causes an expansion of HRP-labelled bladder afferent projections in the spinal cord. These findings raise the possibility that the alterations in central reflex connections in paraplegic animals may be induced in part by changes in peripheral afferent input secondary to outlet obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","capsaicin"

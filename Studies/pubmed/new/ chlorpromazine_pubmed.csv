In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/α1 receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and α1 receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.","chlorpromazine"

A 10 g weight was dropped 5 cm on an impounder placed on the exposed spinal cord at the T-11 level. Changes in potassium concentration on the epidural surface of the injured spinal cord were measured using a combined impounder-K+ electrode assembly. Recovery of motor performance was estimated using the modified Tarlov score. In the injury control (no treatment) group, the recovery was slow. Animals were still paralyzed 4 weeks after injury and none of them could walk; the Tarlov score was 1.88 +/- 0.78 (S.D.). In contrast, the chlorpromazine-treated group (20 mg/kg i.p. 30 min prior to injury) recovered significantly in 4 weeks. Animals could either support body weight or walk with some deficit; the Tarlov score was 4.0 +/- 0.35. Chlorpromazine inhibited potassium efflux from the spinal cord after contusion. Possible mechanisms of protection of neural cells by chlorpromazine are discussed.","chlorpromazine"

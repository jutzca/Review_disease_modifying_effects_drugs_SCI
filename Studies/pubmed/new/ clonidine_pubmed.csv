However, our knowledge about spinal plasticity is rather limited. Our recent studies point to changes within the spinal cord below the lesion. After a lateral left hemisection (T10), cats recovered stepping with both hindlimbs within 3 weeks. After a complete section (T13) in these cats, bilateral stepping was seen on the next day, a skill usually acquired after several weeks of treadmill training. This indicates that durable plastic changes occurred below the lesion. However, because sensory feedback entrains the stepping rhythm, it is difficult to reveal central pattern generator (CPG) adaptation. Here, we investigated whether lumbar segments of cats with a chronic hemisection were able to generate fictive locomotion-that is, without phasic sensory feedback as monitored by five muscle nerves in each hindlimb. With a chronic left hemisection, the number of muscle nerves displaying locomotor bursts was larger on the left than on the right. In addition, transmission of cutaneous reflexes was relatively facilitated on the left. Later during the acute experiment, a complete spinalization (T13) was performed and clonidine was injected to induce rhythmic activities. There were still more muscle nerves displaying locomotor bursts on the left. The results demonstrate that spinal networks were indeed modified after a hemisection with a clear asymmetry between left and right in the capacity to generate locomotion. Plastic changes in CPG and reflex transmission below the lesion are thus involved in the stepping recovery after an incomplete SCI.","clonidine"

Spasticity in the muscles surrounding the ankle joint caused by hypertonia is often reported as a complication. We investigated whether a pharmacological intervention using Tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication acting as an α2-adrenergic agonist, could lead to improvements in walking endurance. We placed subjects on a 4-week program and measured the change in clinical measures of walking speed, endurance, and mobility. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to class subjects into groups based on recovery patterns. Two classes of recovery were found by GMM: high and low functioning. Radom coefficient regression (RCR) was then used to identify significant changes over time. Statistically significant improvements in walking endurance were shown for the high functioning group. However, a small number of subjects in the high functioning group showed improvement greater than the smallest real difference (SRD), which indicates a clinical significance as well. We also investigated the extent to which these recovery patterns can be predicted using baseline measures. Baseline walking endurance was found to be a robust predictor of recovery in walking endurance. Subjects that began the intervention with already higher endurance showed a greater chance of improvement in endurance over time. This information could potentially be used as a fast and reliable assessment tool for clinicians to predict which patient can benefit the most from this intervention prior to prescribing the medication, and thus optimizing cost and resources. Our findings demonstrate that these techniques can be used to characterize and predict the progress of changes to functional impairments due to various types of intervention.","clonidine"

Various interventions have been trialed to improve function and reduce spasticity after SCI, with variable results. We investigated the effects of a pharmacological (an anti-spastic medication - tizanidine) and a physical intervention (robotic-assisted locomotor training - Lokomat) on function in people with incomplete SCI over 4-week of training. The outcome measures were walking speed, endurance and mobility. Subjects were randomized into one of three groups; no intervention (control), Lokomat (Lok) and tizanidine (Tiz). To account for variability, we used growth mixture modelling (GMM) to class subjects based on their recovery patterns. GMM identified two classes of recovery: high and low function. Significant improvements were seen in walking speed and mobility in high and low functioning subjects in the Lok group, and in walking endurance in high functioning subjects in the Tiz group. However, changes with training were clinically important only for approximately 10% of subjects, who achieved a minimal important difference (MID) in functional outcomes as a result of the training. We used mixed model ANOVAs to compare the group effects. Improvements with training were seen in both classes, however no differences between interventions were found. The GMM had classed all subjects that achieved the MID as high functioning. GMM can be used to successfully class subjects; however larger subject numbers and longer interventions are required to fully utilize this technique. Our results demonstrate that both interventions have potential to improve walking capacity, but more intense training for a longer period may need to achieve MID.","clonidine"

Our results demonstrate that the endogenous cholinergic propriospinal system, acting via M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors, is capable of consistently producing well-coordinated locomotor activity in the in vitro neonatal preparation, placing it in a position to contribute to normal locomotion and to provide a basis for recovery of locomotor capability in the absence of descending pathways. Tests of these suggestions, however, reveal that the spinal cholinergic system plays little if any role in the induction of locomotion, because MLR-evoked locomotion in decerebrate cats is not prevented by cholinergic antagonists. Furthermore, it is not required for the development of stepping movements after spinal cord injury, because cholinergic agonists do not facilitate the appearance of locomotion after spinal cord injury, unlike the dramatic locomotion-promoting effects of clonidine, a noradrenergic α-2 agonist. Furthermore, cholinergic antagonists actually improve locomotor activity after spinal cord injury, suggesting that plastic changes in the spinal cholinergic system interfere with locomotion rather than facilitating it. Changes that have been observed in the cholinergic innervation of motoneurons after spinal cord injury do not decrease motoneuron excitability, as expected. Instead, the development of a ""hyper-cholinergic"" state after spinal cord injury appears to enhance motoneuron output and suppress locomotion. A cholinergic suppression of afferent input from the limb after spinal cord injury is also evident from our data, and this may contribute to the ability of cholinergic antagonists to improve locomotion. Not only is a role for the spinal cholinergic system in suppressing locomotion after SCI suggested by our results, but an obligatory contribution of a brainstem cholinergic relay to reticulospinal locomotor command systems is not confirmed by our experiments.","clonidine"

Different interventions have been trialed with variable results. We investigated the effects of pharmacological and physical (locomotor training) interventions on function in people living with incomplete motor function loss caused by SCI and used different analytical techniques to understand whether functional levels affect recovery with different interventions. Participants with an incomplete SCI were assigned to 3 groups: no intervention, Lokomat, or tizanidine. Outcome measures were the 10-m walk test, 6-minute walk test, and the Timed Up and Go. Participants were classified in 2 ways: (1) based on achieving an improvement above the minimally important difference (MID) and (2) using growth mixture modeling (GMM). Functional levels of participants who achieved the MID were compared and random coefficient regression (RCR) was used to assess recovery in GMM classes. Overall, walking speed and endurance improved, with no difference between interventions. Only a small number of participants achieved the MID. Both MID and GMM-RCR analyses revealed that tizanidine improved endurance in high-functioning participants. GMM-RCR classification also showed that speed and mobility improved after locomotor training. Improvements in function were achieved in a limited number of people with SCI. Using the MID and GMM techniques, differences in responses to interventions between high-and low-functioning participants could be identified. These techniques may, therefore, have potential to be used for characterizing therapeutic effects resulting from different interventions.","clonidine"

Since these measures are neither objective nor quantitative, the therapeutic effects of such medications on neuromuscular properties have not been fully evaluated. In this study, as a first attempt, we examined the effect of tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication, on modification of the neuromuscular properties of patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Each patient was administered 2 mg of tizanidine four times per day for four weeks. The spastic ankle of each patient was evaluated at baseline (prior to any medication, and then 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the start of medication. The ankle was perturbed with a small-amplitude Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) perturbation at various positions over the ankle range-of-motion. A parallel-cascade system identification technique, which provides an objective and quantitative measure of neuromuscular properties, was used to calculate the intrinsic and reflex stiffness. The stiffness vs. joint angle trends were then calculated for each evaluation; these curves were compared across the intervention time to determine the recovery pattern (i.e. change over time) due to the tizanidine intervention. All patients exhibited decreases in reflex stiffness (which abnormally increase after SCI) due to the medication; however, patients were observed to exhibit multiple recovery patterns. For some patients, the reflex stiffness continuously reduced over the four-week intervention period, while for other patients, the decrease during the first week (i.e. between the baseline and 1-Week evaluations) was most pronounced. Also, some patients presented a significant decrease with time, while others presented no improvement in the intrinsic stiffness. These findings suggest that tizanidine may be effective in reducing not only reflex stiffness, but also the subject's intrinsic stiffness for certain patients. Future work remains to identify predictors which can objectively determine which patients are likely to exhibit maximal benefit from the tizanidine prior to being prescribed with the medication.","clonidine"

Twenty-nine SCI subjects with spastic hypertonia at their ankle participated in a 12-session Lokomat training regimen, with half receiving Lokomat only (LOKO) and half receiving Lokomat combined with tizanidine (LOKO+TIZ). Walking capacity was evaluated in terms of the 10-meter walking (10MW) speed-a major clinical evaluation of SCI rehabilitation-four times (at the baseline, 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after training). Growth Mixture Model (GMM) was used to classify the walking speed into recovery patterns. Two latent classes were found for each treatment group, corresponding to low speed and high speed. Walking speed increased with training for high-walking-capacity subjects in the LOKO group, and for both high- and low-capacity subjects in the LOKO+TIZ group. Improvement magnitude between pre- and post-test varied among latent classes. Within each class, the baseline measure had a significant effect on walking speed improvement. This study shows that the Lokomat training improves walking speed for patients with SCI, and anti-spasticity medication, such as tizanidine, can improve the efficacy of Lokomat training, particularly for patients with low walking capacity.","clonidine"

However, the mechanisms involved in clonidine-induced functional recovery are poorly understood. Sensory feedback from the legs is critical for hindlimb locomotor recovery in spinalized mammals and clonidine could alter how spinal neurons respond to peripheral inputs in adult spinalized cats. To test this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of clonidine on the responses of hindlimb muscles, primarily in the left hindlimb, evoked by stretching the left triceps surae muscles and by stimulating the right tibial and superficial peroneal nerves in eight adult decerebrate cats that were spinalized 1 month before the terminal experiment. Cats were not trained following spinalization. Clonidine had no consistent effect on responses of ipsilateral muscles evoked by triceps surae muscle stretch. However, clonidine consistently potentiated the amplitude and duration of crossed extensor responses. Moreover, following clonidine injection, stretch and tibial nerve stimulation triggered episodes of locomotor-like activity in approximately one-third of trials. Differential effects of clonidine on crossed reflexes and on ipsilateral responses to muscle stretch indicate an action at a pre-motoneuronal site. We conclude that clonidine facilitates hindlimb locomotor recovery following spinalization in untrained cats by enhancing the excitability of central pattern generating spinal neurons that also participate in crossed extensor reflex transmission.","clonidine"

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of pharmacological agents on gait in people with SCI. A keyword literature search of articles that evaluated the effects of drugs on walking after SCI was performed using the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and hand searching. Two reviewers independently evaluated each study, using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) tool for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and the modified Downs & Black scale for all other studies. Results were tabulated and levels of evidence were assigned. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. One RCT provided Level 1 evidence that GM-1 ganglioside in combination with physical therapy improved motor scores, walking velocity, and distance better than placebo and physical therapy in persons with incomplete SCI. Multiple studies (levels of evidence 1-5) showed that clonidine and cyproheptadine may improve locomotor function and walking speed in severely impaired individuals with incomplete SCI. Gains in walking speed associated with GM-1, cyproheptadine, and clonidine are low compared to those seen with locomotor training. There was also Level 1 evidence that 4-aminopyridine and L-dopa were no better than placebo in helping to improve gait. Two Level 5 studies showed that baclofen had little to no effect on improving walking in persons with incomplete SCI.

Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-Séquard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries.","clonidine"

For example, proprioceptive feedback from limb loading during the stance phase is crucial for the recovery of stepping in spinal-injured animals and humans. Our recent results showed that step training modified transmission from group I afferents of extensors in spinal cats. However, cutaneous afferents are also activated during locomotion and are necessary for proper foot placement in spinal cats. We therefore hypothesized that step training would also modify transmission in cutaneous pathways to facilitate recovery of stepping. We tested transmission in cutaneous pathways by comparing intracellular responses in lumbar motoneurons (n = 136) in trained (n = 11) and untrained (n = 7) cats spinalized 3-5 weeks before the acute electrophysiological experiment. Three cutaneous nerves were stimulated, and each evoked up to three motoneuronal responses mediated by at least three different pathways. Overall, of 71 cutaneous pathways tested, 10 were modified by step training: transmission was reduced in 7 and facilitated in 3. Remarkably, 6 of 10 involved the medial plantar nerve innervating the plantar surface of the foot, including two of the facilitated pathways. Because the cutaneous reflexes are exaggerated after spinalization, we interpret the decrease in most pathways as a normalization of cutaneous transmission necessary to recover locomotor movements. Overall, the results showed a high degree of specificity in plasticity among cutaneous pathways and indicate that transmission of skin inputs signaling ground contact, in particular, is modified by step training.","clonidine"

The EMG activity of the lower limb muscles, initially characterized by tonic discharge and abnormal timing, became more phasic with less clonus following medication, which was related to a change in the kinematic pattern. Further kinematic and functional improvement were gained by training. Previously wheelchair-bound, both patients became functionally ambulatory overground with the aid of Canadian crutches. Thus, a potentially effective strategy for facilitating the expression of the locomotor pattern following spinal cord injury is proposed.

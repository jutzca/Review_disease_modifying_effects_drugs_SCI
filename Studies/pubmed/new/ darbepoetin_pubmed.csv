In this study we compared the neuroprotective efficacy of erythropoietin and a derivative of it, darbepoetin, in an acute model of thoracic SCI. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive erythropoietin (5000 IU/kg), darbepoetin (10 mug/kg), or saline, as a single intravenous injection 1 h after a thoracic contusion SCI. The animals were evaluated for behavioral recovery over 6 weeks, which included BBB locomotor testing, horizontal ladder testing, video-analysis of gait, and hindlimb monofilament sensory testing. At 6 week post-injury, the spinal cords were evaluated histologically to measure white and grey matter sparing at and around the epicenter of injury. We found that neither erythropoietin nor darbepoetin led to improved behavioral recovery over saline controls, with no significant differences observed in BBB scores, BBB subscores, footfall errors on horizontal ladder testing, width of hindlimb base of support, or threshold for paw withdrawal on sensory testing. Furthermore, no differences were observed in grey or white matter sparing between the three experimental groups. Using doses of erythropoietin and darbepoetin that other investigators have reported to be beneficial in SCI and stroke models, we were unable to demonstrate a neuroprotective effect when administered 1 h after injury. Further preclinical investigation is necessary to refine the treatment strategy of using erythropoietin or darbepoetin in acute spinal cord injury.","darbepoetin"

In preclinical trial and human clinical trials, it was demonstrated that erythropoietin is effective treatment for spinal cord injury. Early administration of medications after injury increases the hope of attenuating secondary damage and maximizing an improved outcome. A 42-year-old female patient presented with gait instability and progressive weakness in her right leg over a 6-year period. She was diagnosed as myelomalacia and was candidate for cervical discectomy. After surgery, she suffered from right hemiplegia due to spinal cord injury that did not respond well to routine treatment. Darbepoetin alpha (Aranesp) 100 mcg, subcutaneous daily for three days, was added to the patient's treatment seven days after trauma and resulted in rapid improvement. The patient recovered progressively and was discharged from the hospital ten days after erythropoietin therapy. This case report supports the beneficial role of erythropoietin in function, maintenance, and recovery of neurons. Erythropoietin is a double-edge sword, as long-term erythropoietin therapy has some complications, like thromboembolism and stroke. Recent studies suggested that erythropoietin should be given as single high dose to exert a rapid neuro-protective effect with minimal hematopoietic side effects. We believe that the effects and other adverse consequences of erythropoietin and its non-erythropoietic derivatives should be evaluated in clinical trials.","darbepoetin"

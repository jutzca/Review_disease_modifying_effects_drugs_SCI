All three of these proteins bind to a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) to inhibit axonal outgrowth in vitro. To explore the necessity of NgR for responses to myelin inhibitors and for restriction of axonal growth in the adult CNS, we generated ngr(-/-) mice. Mice lacking NgR are viable but display hypoactivity and motor impairment. DRG neurons lacking NgR do not bind Nogo-66, and their growth cones are not collapsed by Nogo-66. Recovery of motor function after dorsal hemisection or complete transection of the spinal cord is improved in the ngr(-/-) mice. While corticospinal fibers do not regenerate in mice lacking NgR, regeneration of some raphespinal and rubrospinal fibers does occur. Thus, NgR is partially responsible for limiting the regeneration of certain fiber systems in the adult CNS.","desipramine"

The rationale for the study was provided by the observation that 4-AP restores conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers in experimental spinal cord injury. Most injuries (77%) resulted from degenerative disk disease, occurring at or near the thoracolumbar junction, and producing chronic, complete paraplegia. Neurological examination of each dog was recorded on videotape before and at intervals after administration of 4-AP. The drug was administered systemically in total doses between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg body weight. Three areas of neurological status changed significantly at 15-45 minutes following administration of 4-AP: (a) striking improvements in hindlimb placing occurred in 18 animals; (b) increased awareness of painful stimuli to the hindlimb in 10 animals; (c) partial recovery of the cutaneus trunci muscle reflex of the back skin in 9 animals. These effects reversed within a few hours of administration. Other animals (36%) showed no change in neurological signs except a slight enhancement of hindlimb reflex tone. Significant side effects were seen in 6 dogs receiving higher intravenous doses, with elevation of body temperature and apparent anxiety, leading to mild seizures in 3 of the animals. These seizures were controlled with diazepam. The results indicate that conduction block may contribute significantly to functional deficits in closed-cord injuries and that potassium channel blockade may prove to be a valid, if limited approach to therapeutic intervention in chronic paraplegia and paraparesis.","diazepam"

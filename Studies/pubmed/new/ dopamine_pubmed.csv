How does spinal cord injury affect prefrontal cortex function and the expression of dopamine receptors? What is the main finding and its importance? Spinal cord injury impaired cognitive function, which was associated with reduced dopamine receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex. The effect of spinal cord injury (SCI) has been studied widely in paraplegia and motor areas of the brain, but its mechanisms in memory and cognitive impairment remain controversial. Here, we focused on the impact of SCI on prefrontal performance via dopamine levels and receptors. We divided 18 male rats into three groups, i.e. control, laminectomy and SCI groups. Laminectomy and SCI were induced at T10 of the spinal cord. One week later, after locomotor recovery, the novel object recognition and T-maze (spontaneous alternation) tests were applied. After behavioural assessments, the rats were killed and their brain tissues harvested. According to the behavioural findings, cognitive function was impaired in the SCI group (P < 0.05). Also, SCI significantly increased the dopamine level and decreased the expression of dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex 2 weeks after injury (P < 0.05). Given the role of dopamine in cognition, SCI could impair novel object recognition and spatial working memory via dopaminergic systems.","dopamine"

We aimed to determine the effects of optimizing spinal cord perfusion on neurological recovery and risks for adverse events. We searched multiple databases for published and unpublished reports. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. We synthesized data and evaluated confidence in anticipated treatment effects according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We identified 20 eligible observational studies and 1 eligible randomized controlled trial. According to low or very low quality evidence, the effect of MAP support on neurological recovery after acute traumatic spinal cord injury is uncertain, and the use of vasopressors to support MAP may be associated with increased rates of predominantly cardiac adverse events. Increased SCPP appears likely to be associated with improved neurological recovery, but SCPP monitoring via intradural catheters at the anatomical site of injury may involve increased risks of cerebrospinal fluid leakage requiring revision surgery or pseudomeningocele. No study directly compared the effects of specific MAP goal ranges, SCPP ranges, SCPP monitoring techniques, or durations of treatment. Very low quality evidence suggests that norepinephrine may have less risk of adverse events than dopamine. The current literature is insufficient to make strong recommendations about interventions to support spinal cord perfusion via MAP or SCPP goals in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries. Data are compatible with a variety of treatment decisions, and individualized approaches may be optimal. Further investigation to clarify the risks, benefits, and alternatives to MAP or SCPP support in this population is warranted.","dopamine"

We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.","dopamine"

The striatal A2AR-D2R heteromer has a tetrameric structure and forms part of a signaling complex that includes a Gs and a Gi protein and the effector adenyl cyclase (subtype AC5). Another target of caffeine, the adenosine A1 receptor-dopamine D1 receptor (A1R-D1R) heteromer, seems to have a very similar structure. Initially suggested to be localized in the striatum, the A1R-D1R heteromer has now been identified in the spinal motoneuron and shown to mediate the spinally generated caffeine-induced locomotion. In this study, we review the recently discovered properties of A2AR-D2R and A1R-D1R heteromers. Our studies demonstrate that these complexes are a necessary condition to sustain the canonical antagonistic interaction between a Gs-coupled receptor (A2AR or D1R) and a Gi-coupled receptor (D2R or A1R) at the adenylyl cyclase level, which constitutes a new concept in the field of G protein-coupled receptor physiology and pharmacology. A2AR antagonists targeting the striatal A2AR-D2R heteromer are already being considered as therapeutic agents in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we review the preclinical evidence that indicates that caffeine and A2AR antagonists could be used to treat the motivational symptoms of depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, while A1R antagonists selectively targeting the spinal A1R-D1R heteromer could be used in the recovery of spinal cord injury.","dopamine"

We have recently reported that the locomotor CPG in neonatal mice rapidly recovers the ability to produce neurochemically induced fictive locomotion following an upper lumbar spinal cord compression injury. Here we address the question of recovery of multi-rhythmic activity and the serotonin-sensitivity of the CPG. In isolated spinal cords from control and 3 days post-injury mice, application of dopamine and NMDA elicited multi-rhythmic activity with slow and fast components. The slow component comprised 10-20 s episodes of activity that were synchronous in ipsilateral or all lumbar ventral roots, and the fast components involved bursts within these episodes that displayed coordinated patterns of alternation between ipsilateral roots. Rhythm strength was the same in control and injured spinal cords. However, power spectral analysis of signal within episodes showed a reduced peak frequency after recovery. In control spinal cords, serotonin triggered fictive locomotion only when applied at high concentration (30 µM, constant NMDA). By contrast, in about 50% of injured preparations fictive locomotion was evoked by 2-3 times lower serotonin concentrations (10-15 µM). This increased serotonin sensitivity was correlated with post-injury changes in the expression of specific serotonin receptor transcripts, but not of dopamine receptor transcripts.","dopamine"

We recently found that a crushed spinal cord lesion can minimize fibrotic scarring and grafted cell death compared with open-dura injuries. To determine if this SCI model is applicable for studying cardiovascular recovery, we examined hemodynamic consequences following crushed SCI and tested cardiovascular responses to serotonin (5-HT) or dopamine (DA) receptor agonists. Using a radio-telemetric system, multiple cardiovascular parameters were recorded prior to, 2, and 4 weeks after SCI, including resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), as well as spontaneous or colorectal distension (CRD)-induced autonomic dysreflexia (AD). The results showed that this injury caused tachycardia at rest as well as the occurrence of spontaneous or artificially induced dysreflexic events. Four weeks post-injury, specific activation of 5-HT2A receptors by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intrathecal (i.t.) delivery of Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) remarkably increased resting MAP levels in a dose-dependent fashion. During CRD-induced autonomic dysreflexia, systemic administration of DOI alleviated the severity of bradycardia responsive to episodic hypertension. In contrast, selective stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors with 8-OH-DPAT or non-selective activation of DA receptors with apomorphine did not affect cardiovascular performance. Thus, crush injuries induce cardiovascular abnormalities in rats that are sensitive to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation, indicating a reliable SCI model to study how cell-based approaches impact the severity of autonomic dysreflexia and identify a possible target for pharmacological interventions.","dopamine"

Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.","dopamine"

In this study, we tested a triple re-uptake inhibitor, DOV 216,303, for its ability to affect motor function recovery after spinal cord injury in mice. We impacted C57 mouse spinal cord at the T11 vertebral level and administered vehicle or DOV 216,303 at 10 mg/kg, b.i.d via intraperitoneal injections for 7 days.

Improving neurological recovery by reducing secondary injury is a major principle in the management of SCI. To minimize secondary injury, blood pressure (BP) augmentation has been advocated. The objective of this study was to review the evidence behind BP management after SCI. METHODS This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Using the PubMed database, the authors identified studies that investigated BP management after acute SCI. Information on BP goals, duration of BP management, vasopressor selection, and neurological outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Eleven studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. Nine studies were retrospective, and 2 were single-cohort prospective investigations. Of the 9 retrospective studies, 7 reported a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of higher than 85 mm Hg. For the 2 prospective studies, the MAP goals were higher than 85 mm Hg and higher than 90 mm Hg. The duration of BP management varied from more than 24 hours to 7 days in 6 of the retrospective studies that reported the duration of treatment. In both prospective studies, the duration of treatment was 7 days. In the 2 prospective studies, neurological outcomes were stable to improved with BP management. The retrospective studies, however, were contradictory with regard to the correlation of BP management and outcomes. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were the agents that were frequently used to augment BP. However, more complications have been associated with dopamine use than with the other vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS There are no high-quality data regarding optimal BP goals and duration in the management of acute SCI. Based on the highest level of evidence available from the 2 prospective studies, MAP goals of 85-90 mm Hg for a duration of 5-7 days should be considered. Norepinephrine for cervical and upper thoracic injuries and phenylephrine or norepinephrine for mid- to lower thoracic injuries should be considered.","dopamine"

Behavioural recovery is evident within a few days and approaches normal function within about 3 weeks. Fictive locomotion in the isolated injured spinal cord cannot be elicited by a neurochemical cocktail containing NMDA, dopamine and serotonin 1 day post-injury, but can 3 days post-injury as readily as in the uninjured spinal cord. Low frequency coordinated rhythmic activity can be elicited in the isolated uninjured spinal cord by NMDA + dopamine (without serotonin), but not in the isolated injured spinal cord. In both the injured and uninjured spinal cord, eliciting bona fide fictive locomotion requires the additional presence of serotonin. Following incomplete compression injury in the thoracic spinal cord of neonatal mice 1 day after birth (P1), we previously reported that virtually normal hindlimb locomotor function is recovered within about 3 weeks despite substantial permanent thoracic tissue loss. Here, we asked whether similar recovery occurs following lumbar injury that impacts more directly on the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). As in thoracic injuries, lumbar injuries caused about 90% neuronal loss at the injury site and increased serotonergic innervation below the injury. Motor recovery was slower after lumbar than thoracic injury, but virtually normal function was attained by P25 in both cases. Locomotor CPG status was tested by eliciting fictive locomotion in isolated spinal cords using a widely used neurochemical cocktail (NMDA, dopamine, serotonin). No fictive locomotion could be elicited 1 day post-injury, but could within 3 days post-injury as readily as in age-matched uninjured control spinal cords. Burst patterning and coordination were largely similar in injured and control spinal cords but there were differences. Notably, in both groups there were two main locomotor frequencies, but injured spinal cords exhibited a shift towards the higher frequency. Injury also altered the neurochemical dependence of locomotor CPG output, such that injured spinal cords, unlike control spinal cords, were incapable of generating low frequency rhythmic coordinated activity in the presence of NMDA and dopamine alone. Thus, the neonatal spinal cord also exhibits remarkable functional recovery after lumbar injuries, but the neurochemical sensitivity of locomotor circuitry is modified in the process.","dopamine"

Although traditionally it is believed that in mammalian spinal cord, monoamine neurotransmitters mainly originate from the brain, accumulating evidence indicates that especially when the spinal cord is injured, they can also be produced in the spinal cord. In this review, I will present evidence for a possible pathway for two-step synthesis of dopamine and serotonin in the spinal cord. Published data from different sources and unpublished data from my own ongoing projects indicate that monoenzymatic cells expressing aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) are present in the spinal cord and that these TH and THP cells often lie in close proximity to AADC cells. Prompted by the above evidence, I hypothesize that dopamine and serotonin could be synthesized sequentially in two monoenzymatic cells in the spinal cord via a TH-AADC and a TPH-AADC cascade respectively. The monoamines synthesized through this pathway may compensate for lost neurotransmitters following spinal cord injury and also may play specific roles in the recovery of sensory, motor and autonomic functions.","dopamine"

DA-mediated regulation of urinary activity is considered to occur through an interaction between midbrain DA neurons and the pontine micturition center. Here we show that DA is produced in the rat spinal cord and modulates the bladder reflex. We observed numerous tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons in the autonomic nuclei and superficial dorsal horn in L6-S3 spinal segments. These neurons are dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH)- and some contain detectable dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), suggesting their capacity to produce DA. Interestingly, following a complete thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) to interrupt supraspinal projections, more TH+ neurons emerged in the lumbosacral spinal cord, coincident with a sustained, low level of DA expression there and a partially recovered micturition reflex. Non-selective blockade of spinal DA receptors reduced bladder activity whereas activation of spinal D2-like receptors increased bladder activity and facilitated voiding. Additionally, depletion of lumbosacral TH+ neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) decreased bladder non-voiding contractions and voiding efficiency. Furthermore, injecting the transsynaptic neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the bladder detrusor labeled TH+ cells in the lumbosacral cord, confirming their involvement in spinal micturition reflex circuits. These results illustrate that DA is synthesized in the rat spinal cord; plasticity of lumbosacral TH+ neurons following SCI may contribute to DA expression and modulate the spinal bladder reflex. Thus, spinally-derived DA and receptors could be a novel therapeutic target to improve micturition recovery after SCI.","dopamine"

Furthermore, 71.43% of patients with penetrating SCI treated with vasopressors experienced associated cardiogenic complications. Given the decreased likelihood of neurological improvement in penetrating injuries, it may be important to re-examine intervention strategies in this population. Specifically, the use of vasopressors, in particular dopamine, with their associated complications is more likely to cause complications than to result in neurological improvement.

Ejaculation is a reflex and the spinal generator for ejaculatory reflexes in the rat has been located in the lumbosacral spinal cord. The effects of SCI on the rat spinal ejaculation generator and ejaculatory reflexes remain understudied. The first goal of the current study was to establish the effects of chronic SCI on the function of the spinal ejaculation generator. Male rats received a contusion injury of the spinal cord at spinal level T6-T7. Ejaculatory reflexes elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsal penile nerve (DPN) were evaluated in injured and control rats at 4-6 weeks following SCI. SCI males demonstrated significant reductions in bursting of the bulbocavernosus muscle (BCM), an indicator for expulsion phase of ejaculation, and in seminal vesicle pressure (SVP) increases, an indicator for the emission phase of ejaculation, following DPN stimulation. Thus, contusion SCI resulted in long-term impairment of ejaculatory reflexes. The D3 agonist 7-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (7OHDPAT) facilitates ejaculation in spinal cord intact rats, thus the second goal of the current study was to test whether subcutaneous infusions of 7OHDPAT can facilitate ejaculatory reflexes in rats with chronic SCI. Male rats received a contusion injury at T6-T7 and effects of systemic administration of 7OHDPAT (1 mg/kg) were tested 4-5 weeks following injury. Results showed that 7OHDPAT administration facilitated ejaculatory reflexes in SCI males with or without DPN stimulation, provided that supraspinal inputs to the lumbar cord were severed by transection just prior to evaluating the reflex. Thus, 7OHDPAT administration in SCI males was able to overcome the detrimental effects of SCI on ejaculatory reflexes.","dopamine"

Changes in the expression of the D2 receptor were also studied. We report the full anatomical regeneration of the dopaminergic system after an initial decrease in the number of dopaminergic cells and fibres.

Here we studied the recovery of crawling in the leech Hirudo verbana after descending cephalic fibers were surgically separated from crawl central pattern generators shown previously to be regulated by dopamine. We observed that immediately after nerve cord transection leeches were unable to crawl, but remarkably, after a day to weeks, animals began to show elements of crawling and intersegmental coordination. Over a similar time course, excessive swimming due to the loss of descending inhibition returned to control levels. Additionally, removal of the brain did not prevent crawl recovery, indicating that connectivity of severed descending neurons was not essential. After crawl recovery, a subset of animals received a second transection immediately below the anterior-most ganglion remaining. Similar to their initial transection, a loss of crawling with subsequent recovery was observed. These data, in recovered individuals, support the idea that compensatory plasticity directly below the site of injury is essential for the initiation and coordination of crawling. We maintain that the leech provides a valuable model to understand the neural mechanisms underlying locomotor recovery after injury because of its experimental accessibility, segmental organization, and dependence on higher-order control involved in the initiation, modulation, and coordination of locomotor behavior.","dopamine"

To readily respond to environmental conditions, these networks must be flexible yet at the same time robust. Neuromodulators play a key role in contributing to network flexibility in a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate networks. For example, neuromodulators contribute to altering intrinsic properties and synaptic weights that, in extreme cases, can lead to neurons switching between networks. Here we focus on the role of dopamine in the control of stepping networks in the spinal cord. We first review the role of dopamine in modulating rhythmic activity in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and the leech, since work from these preparations provides a foundation to understand its role in vertebrate systems. We then move to a discussion of dopamine's role in modulation of swimming in aquatic species such as the larval xenopus, lamprey and zebrafish. The control of terrestrial walking in vertebrates by dopamine is less studied and we review current evidence in mammals with a focus on rodent species. We discuss data suggesting that the source of dopamine within the spinal cord is mainly from the A11 area of the diencephalon, and then turn to a discussion of dopamine's role in modulating walking patterns from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. Similar to the descending serotonergic system, the dopaminergic system may serve as a potential target to promote recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury (SCI); evidence suggests that dopaminergic agonists can promote recovery of function following SCI. We discuss pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches that could be deployed in SCI and their potential tractability. Throughout the review we draw parallels with both noradrenergic and serotonergic modulatory effects on spinal cord networks. In all likelihood, a complementary monoaminergic enhancement strategy should be deployed following SCI.","dopamine"

In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/α1 receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and α1 receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.","dopamine"

Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-Séquard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries.","dopamine"

When exposed to light with appropriate wavelength, action potentials can be triggered in ChR2-expressing neurons, whereas inhibition of action potentials can be obtained in NpHR-expressing neurons, thus allowing for powerful control of neural activity. Optogenetics is now intensively used in laboratory animals, both in vitro and in vivo, for exploring functions of complex neural circuits and information processing in the normal brain and during various neurological conditions. The clinical perspectives of adopting optogenetics as a novel treatment strategy for human neurological disorders have generated considerable interest, largely because of the enormous potential demonstrated in recent rodent and nonhuman primate studies.

Spinal cord injury studies use the presence of noradrenergic (NA) axons caudal to the injury site as evidence of axonal regeneration and we previously found more NA axons just caudal to the transection in OEG- than media-injected spinal rats. We therefore hypothesized that OEG transplantation promotes descending coeruleospinal regeneration that contributes to the recovery of hindlimb locomotion. Now we report that NA axons are present throughout the caudal stump of both media- and OEG-injected spinal rats and they enter the spinal cord from the periphery via dorsal and ventral roots and along large penetrating blood vessels. These results indicate that the presence of NA fibers in the caudal spinal cord is not a reliable indicator of coeruleospinal regeneration. We then asked if NA axons appose cholinergic neurons associated with motor functions, i.e., central canal cluster and partition cells (active during fictive locomotion) and somatic motor neurons (SMNs). We found more NA varicosities adjacent to central canal cluster cells, partition cells, and SMNs in the lumbar enlargement of OEG- than media-injected rats. As non-synaptic release of NA is common in the spinal cord, more associations between NA varicosities and motor-associated cholinergic neurons in the lumbar spinal cord may contribute to the improved treadmill stepping observed in OEG-injected spinal rats. This effect could be mediated through direct association with SMNs and/or indirectly via cholinergic interneurons.","dopamine"

In the present study, we explored the possibility to increase the survival, function, axonal outgrowth and striatal reinnervation of NSC by co-grafting with OEC in 6-OHDA lesioned parkinsonian rats. In the presence of OEC, significantly enhanced survival of NSC-derived DA neurons and axonal fiber outgrowth was evident in the striatum of NSC+OEC co-grafted rats at 24 weeks post-grafting as compared with NSC alone grafted rats.

We used immunohistochemistry to investigate distal plasticity of serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways that have been shown to modulate locomotion. After SCI, pups exhibited an expected decrease in monoaminergic innervation of the lumbosacral cord, consistent with partial loss of these descending pathways. Unlike published results for the adult, we found no evidence of partial reinnervation with time after injury. On the other hand, oligodendrocytes at and near the lesion epicenter of the young rats appeared unexpectedly resilient to the insult. No evidence of oligodendrocyte loss in spared white matter was detected at 24 h after injury, as compared to the 50% loss reported in adults. Rather, there was a significant increase in the density of oligodendrocytes by 5 days after injury that was associated with a dramatic upregulation of markers for glial progenitor cells after pup SCI.

Grafting OEC or astrocytes alone had no effects.

Comparable results were observed in a co-culture system where OEC promoted dopamine cell survival and neurite elongation through a mechanism involving both releasable factors and direct contact.

Early uncontrolled clinical reports were enthusiastic, but the outcome of the first randomized, double blind, controlled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure Parkinson's disease, although there were some significant positive findings. Were the earlier animal studies and clinical reports wrong? Should we give up on the goal? Some aspects of the trial design and implantation methods may have led to lack of effects and to some side effects such as dyskinesias. But a detailed review of clinical neural transplants published to date still suggests that neural transplantation variably reverses some aspects of Parkinson's disease, although differing methods make exact comparisons difficult. While the randomized clinical studies have been in progress, new methods have shown promise for increasing transplant survival and distribution, reconstructing the circuits to provide dopamine to the appropriate targets and with normal regulation. Selected promising new strategies are reviewed that block apoptosis induced by tissue dissection, promote vascularization of grafts, reduce oxidant stress, provide key growth factors, and counteract adverse effects of increased age. New sources of replacement cells and stem cells may provide additional advantages for the future. Full recovery from parkinsonism appears not only to be possible, but a reliable cell replacement treatment may finally be near.","dopamine"

Rats spontaneously walk from a starting location to a goal along a horizontal ladder. The spacing between the rungs of the ladder is variable and can be changed to prevent the animal from learning either the absolute or relative location of the rungs. The testing procedure requires minimal training and allows detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis using video recording. The utility of the test is described with postoperative data obtained from animals with unilateral neocortical strokes produced by pial stripping over the motor cortex, neonatal and adult unilateral corticospinal tract lesions produced by tract section at the pyramids, and unilateral dopamine depletions produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle. In addition, a group of aged rats was examined. Deficits in limb placing, stepping and co-ordination displayed by the animals demonstrate that this test can discriminate between lesions of the motor system or age-associated impairments. The test is useful for assessing loss and recovery of function due to brain or spinal cord injury, the effectiveness of treatment therapies, as well as compensatory processes through which animals adapt to nervous system injury.","dopamine"

To reduce allodynia, it would be desirable to implant a permanent biological pump such as adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (AM), which secrete catecholamines and opioid peptides, both antinociceptive substances, near the spinal cord. We tested this approach using a recently developed a mammalian SCI model of chronic central pain, which results in development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. Thirty day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally hemisected at T13 and allowed 4 weeks for recovery of locomotor function and development of allodynia. Nonimmunosuppressed injured animals received either control-striated muscle (n = 7) or AM (n = 10) transplants. Nociceptive behavior was tested for 4 weeks posttransplant as measured by paw withdrawals to von Frey filaments, radiant heat, and pin prick stimuli. Hemisected animals receiving AM demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both fore- and hindlimb mechanical and thermal allodynia, but not analgesia, when compared to hemisected animals receiving striated muscle transplants (P < 0.05). Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity indicated prolonged transplant survival and production of catecholamines. HPLC analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples from animals receiving AM transplants demonstrated statistically significant increases in levels of dopamine (sevenfold), norepinephrine (twofold), and epinephrine (threefold), compared to control values several weeks following transplant (P < 0.05). By 28 days posttransplant, however, antinociceptive effects were diminished. These results support the therapeutic potential of transplanted AM in reducing chronic central pain following spinal cord injury.","dopamine"

Fourteen days after cord injury the levels of endogenous norepinephrine (NE, -33%), dopamine (DA, -50%) and serotonin (5-HT, -55%) in the lumbar cord in the injury control rats were decreased and there were significant correlations between the neurologic score and the NE level (rs = 0.562, P less than 0.01) and the 5-HT level (rs = 0.745, P less than 0.001) but not the DA level. Bilateral i.c.v. injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (200 micrograms/rat) 24 h after cord injury significantly retarded the neurologic recovery during the 14 days after injury, accompanied by a further reduction in the 5-HT level (-86%) but not in the NE or DA level. On the other hand, neither p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) (300 mg/kg, i.p., once daily starting 24 h after injury for 13 consecutive days) nor reserpine (1 mg/kg, i.p., 4 times, once 24 h after injury and then every fourth day) had any influence on the time course of the neurologic recovery during the 14 days after injury, although PCPA treatment further reduced the levels of NE (-50%) and 5-HT (-91%), and reserpine treatment further reduced the levels of NE (-95%), DA (-73%) and 5-HT (-85%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","dopamine"

Environmental stimulation produces changes including expansion of visual cortex, increases in dendritic branching, glia and cholinesterase. Environmental stimulation also produces behavioural changes. Experimental electrical stimulation produces changes in synapse size, synaptic vesicle change, dendritic branching and changes in synaptic transmission. In man, repetitive electrical stimulation via epidural electrodes increases plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, and CSF levels of norepinephrine. Repetitive electrical stimulation in man dates back to 1967 and has been used for the control of pain, to improve spasticity, bladder control, motor deficit and the autonomic hyperreflexia of spinal cord injury. In addition, improvement has been reported in epilepsy, cerebral palsy, torticollis and peripheral vascular diseases. The best controlled studies are in multiple sclerosis and peripheral vascular disease, and these results will be presented in more detail.","dopamine"

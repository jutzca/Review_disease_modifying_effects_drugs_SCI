Our objectives were to determine (a) the acute effects of bodyweight-supported treadmill training (TM) on hindlimb cancellous bone microstructure and muscle mass in adult rats after severe contusion SCI and (b) whether longer-term TM with adjuvant testosterone enanthate (TE) delivers musculoskeletal benefit. In Study 1, TM (40 min/day, 5 days/week, beginning 1 week postsurgery) did not prevent SCI-induced hindlimb cancellous bone loss after 3 weeks. In Study 2, TM did not attenuate SCI-induced plantar flexor muscles atrophy nor improve locomotor recovery after 4 weeks. In our main study, SCI produced extensive distal femur and proximal tibia cancellous bone deficits, a deleterious slow-to-fast fiber-type transition in soleus, lower muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), impaired muscle force production, and levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle atrophy after 8 weeks. TE alone (7.0 mg/week) suppressed bone resorption, attenuated cancellous bone loss, constrained the soleus fiber-type transition, and prevented LABC atrophy. In comparison, TE+TM concomitantly suppressed bone resorption and stimulated bone formation after SCI, produced near-complete cancellous bone preservation, prevented the soleus fiber-type transition, attenuated soleus fCSA atrophy, maintained soleus force production, and increased LABC mass. 75% of SCI+TE+TM animals recovered voluntary over-ground hindlimb stepping, while no SCI and only 20% of SCI+TE animals regained stepping ability. Positive associations between testosterone and locomotor function suggest that TE influenced locomotor recovery. In conclusion, short-term TM alone did not improve bone, muscle, or locomotor recovery in adult rats after severe SCI, while longer-term TE+TM provided more comprehensive musculoskeletal benefit than TE alone.","estradiol"

This could be due to the enormous innervation of the spinocerebellar tract from the posterior gray horn in the spinal cord to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Although the neuroprotective role of estradiol in spinal cord (SC) injuries, as well as its ability to delay secondary cell death changes, is well-known, its effect on cerebellar layers is not fully investigated. In this study, a SCI model was achieved by injection of Kainic acid into SC of adult Male Wistar rats in order to assess the effects of SCI on the cerebellum. The animals were classified into SCI group (animals with SCI), estradiol-treated group (animals with SCI and received estradiol), control groups, and sham control group. The microscopical examination 24 h after induction of SCI revealed that KA induced the most characteristics of neurodegeneration including astrocytic propagation and microglial activation. The estradiol was injected intraperitoneally 20 min after induction of SCI, and the samples were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days. Histologically, the estradiol reduced the inflammatory response, enhanced the recovery of molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell layers, and therefore aided in the restoration of layer organization. These findings were also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and gene expression profiling.","estradiol"

In the current study, we evaluated the roles of E2 administration before SCs transplantation in targeting SCI-induced axonal degeneration and demyelination. E2 (25 µg/kg, IP) was administered to the male Wistar rats underwent contusive SCI at T10 segment. At 7 days after injury, 1 × 106 SCs were transplanted to the injury epicenter of the spinal cord. The groups were laminectomy, SCI, SCI+E2, and SCI+E2+SCs. Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso-Bresnahan-Beattie locomotor test. Sections from spinal cord were also assessed for histoloical staining, including Luxol fast blue, Bielschowsky's silver and immunofluorescence evaluation of myelin basic protein (MBP). The SCI group showed impaired locomotion in the hind limb, increased number of cavities within spinal cord, low observable numbers of regenerating fibers, and a significant decrease in the rate of expression for MBP. These changes were counteracted in the treatment groups ( P < 0.05 vs SCI) with no significant changes among them. From the results, it may be concluded that application of E2 and SCs could be effective when axons undergo demyelination and degenerative processes, and their combination could partly provide cumulative outcomes.","estradiol"

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone.","estradiol"

We previously demonstrated that motoneurons and the muscles they innervate show pronounced atrophy after SCI, and these changes are prevented by treatment with testosterone. Here, we assessed whether the testosterone active metabolites estradiol and dihydrotestosterone have similar protective effects after SCI. Young adult female rats received either sham or T9 spinal cord contusion injuries and were treated with estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, both, or nothing via Silastic capsules. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor testing was performed weekly and voiding behavior was assessed at 3 weeks post-injury. Four weeks after SCI, lesion volume and tissue sparing, quadriceps muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and motoneuron dendritic morphology were assessed. Spontaneous locomotor behavior improved after SCI, but hormone treatments had no effect. Voiding behavior was disrupted after SCI, but was significantly improved by treatment with either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone; combined treatment was maximally effective. Treatment with estradiol reduced lesion volume, but dihydrotestosterone alone and estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone were ineffective. SCI-induced decreases in motoneuron dendritic length were attenuated by all hormone treatments. SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were prevented by treatment with either dihydrotestosterone or estradiol combined with dihydrotestosterone, but estradiol treatment was ineffective. These findings suggest that deficits in micturition and regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology seen after SCI are ameliorated by treatment with estradiol or dihydrotestosterone, further supporting a role for steroid hormones as neurotherapeutic agents in the injured nervous system.","estradiol"

The inflammatory response initiated by spinal cord injury (SCI) involves the processing of interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and IL-18 mediated by caspase-1 which is under the control of an intracellular multiprotein complex called inflammasome. We recently described in a SCI model that between 24 and 72 h post-injury, most of inflammasome components including IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 are upregulated. In this study, we investigated the influence of E2 treatment after spinal cord contusion on inflammasome regulation. After contusion of T9 spinal segment, 12-week-old male Wistar rats were treated subcutaneously with E2 immediately after injury and every 12 h for the next 3 days. Behavioral scores were significantly improved in E2-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated groups. Functional improvement in E2-treated animals was paralleled by the attenuated expression of certain inflammasome components such as ASC, NLRP1b, and NLRP3 together with IL1b, IL-18, and caspase-1. On the histopathological level, microgliosis and oligodendrocyte injury was ameliorated. These findings support and extend the knowledge of the E2-mediated neuroprotective function during SCI. The control of the inflammasome machinery by E2 might be a missing piece of the puzzle to understand the anti-inflammatory potency of E2.","estradiol"

At each time point, fine needle aspiration biopsy samples were taken from the testes for cytological assessment, and serum levels of relevant hormones were measured.

The physical trauma to the spinal cord initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generates a non-permissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment. In addition, the effects of Tamoxifen in axonal outgrowth or synapse formation needs to be investigated.

Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 μg 17β-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).","estradiol"

In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-α mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-α antagonist. We also observed that ER-α was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-α. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-α dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen׳s effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition.","estradiol"

We also show that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 is specifically expressed by neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells, but not astrocytes. Furthermore, estrogen treatment prevents spinal cord injury-induced apoptotic cell death and enhances functional recovery after spinal cord injury, which can be mimicked by the specific G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 agonist G-1 and inhibited by specific knockdown of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 expression, but not pure nuclear ER antagonist ICI 182,780.

Therefore, therapeutic approaches to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death after SCI should be considered. Estrogens are well known to have a broad neuroprotective effect, but the protective effect of estrogens on oligodendrocytes after injury is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that 17β-estradiol attenuates apoptosis of oligodendrocytes by inhibiting RhoA and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation after SCI. Estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β were expressed in oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord, and 17β-estradiol treatment significantly inhibited oligodendrocyte cell death at 7 d after injury as compared with vehicle (cyclodextrin) control. 17β-Estradiol also attenuated caspase-3 and -9 activation at 7 d and reduced the loss of axons from progressive degeneration. In addition, 17β-estradiol inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were activated and peaked at 3 and/or 5 d after injury. Furthermore, administration of Rho inhibitor, PEP-1-C3 exoenzyme, inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, and decreased phosphorylated c-Jun level at 5 d after injury. Additionally, the attenuation of RhoA and JNK3 activation as well as oligodendrocyte cell death by 17β-estradiol was reversed by ER antagonist, ICI182780. Our results thus indicate that 17β-estradiol treatment improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing oligodendrocyte cell death via inhibition of RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were ER dependent. Furthermore, improvement of hindlimb motor function by posttreatment of 17β-estradiol suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI patients.","estradiol"

In contrast, most experimental models of SCI in rodents induce damage in the thoracic cord, resulting primarily in white matter disruption. To address this disparity, experimental cervical SCI models have been developed. Thus, we used a recently characterized model of cervical hemicontusion SCI in adult male rats to assess the potential therapeutic effect of post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol. Rats received a hemicontusion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra (C5) followed by administration of 17β-estradiol via a slow release pellet (0.5 or 5.0 mg/pellet) beginning at 30 minutes post-SCI. Behavioral evaluation of skilled and unskilled forelimb function and locomotor function were conducted for 7 weeks after SCI. Upon conclusion of the behavioral assessments, spinal cords were collected and histochemistry and stereology were conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on the lesion characteristics. We found that post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol decreased neuronal loss in the ventral horn, decreased reactive astrogliosis, decreased the immune response, and increased white mater sparing at the lesion epicenter. Additionally, post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol improved skilled forelimb function and locomotor function. Taken together, these data suggest that post-SCI administration of 17β-estradiol protected both the gray and white matter in cervical SCI. Moreover, this treatment improved function on skilled motor tasks that involve both gray and white matter components, suggesting that this is likely a highly clinically relevant protective strategy.","estradiol"

Methylprednisolone, the only currently available therapy renders limited protection in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be tested to maximize neuroprotection and functional recovery. Previous data from our laboratory indicate that estrogen (17β-estradiol) at a high dose may attenuate multiple damaging pathways involved in SCI and improve locomotor outcome. Since use of high dose estrogen may have detrimental side effects and therefore may never be used in the clinic, the current study investigated the efficacy of this steroid hormone at very low doses in SCI. In particular, we tested the impact of dosing (1-10 μg/kg), mode of delivery (intravenous vs. osmotic pump), and delay in estrogen application (15 min-4 h post-SCI) on microgliosis and neuronal death in acute SCI in rats. Treatment with 17β-estradiol (1-10 μg/kg) significantly reduced microglial activation and also attenuated apoptosis of neurons compared to untreated SCI animals. The attenuation of cell death and inflammation by estrogen was observed regardless of mode and time of delivery following injury. These findings suggest estrogen as a potential agent for the treatment of individuals with SCI.","estradiol"

We hypothesized that respiratory recovery after C2 spinal hemisection (C2HS) differs between males and females and is blunted by prior ovariectomy (OVX) in females. Inspiratory tidal volume (VT), frequency (fR), and ventilation (VE) were quantified during quiet breathing (baseline) and 7% CO2 challenge before and after C2HS in unanesthetized adult rats via plethysmography. Baseline breathing was similarly altered in all rats (reduced VT, elevated fR) but during hypercapnia females had relatively higher VT (i.e. compared to pre-injury) than male or OVX rats (p<0.05). Phrenic neurograms recorded in anesthetized rats indicated that normalized burst amplitude recorded ipsilateral to C2HS (i.e. the crossed phrenic phenomenon) is greater in females during respiratory challenge (p<0.05 vs. male and OVX). We conclude that sex differences in recovery of VT and phrenic output are present at 2 weeks post-C2HS. These differences are consistent with the hypothesis that ovarian sex hormones influence respiratory recovery after cervical spinal cord injury.","estradiol"

Two doses of 17beta-estradiol (0.1 or 4 mg/kg) were injected i.p. immediately after spinal cord compression. Functional outcome was observed during 4 weeks following injury with two different tests. Release of cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) was assessed 6 h, 3 days and 1 week post-injury. Reactive astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP and vimentin, and diffusion of CD68-positive inflammatory cells were examined from 3 days to 4 weeks following SCI. Treatment with 17beta-estradiol significantly increased locomotor function from the first week until 4 weeks post-SCI. The injured spinal cord of 17beta-estradiol-treated rats expressed more IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 than controls 6 h after injury. Moreover, 17beta-estradiol-treated rats showed reactive astrocytes as soon as 3 days following SCI, with increased GFAP expression, smaller lesion areas and more limited diffusion of CD68-positive cells after 1 week post-injury compared to controls. The number of CD68-positive cells was also reduced in 17beta-estradiol-treated rats one week post-SCI. However, these differences between 17beta-estradiol-treated and control rats disappeared after 4 weeks. These results suggest that 17beta-estradiol protects the spinal cord by stimulating early cytokines release and astroglial responses. These stimulations may prevent the area of damage from expanding and inflammatory cells to spread in the surrounding tissue during the critical first week following SCI. Although transient, these effects improved the locomotor recovery that was sustained over 4 weeks after injury.","estradiol"

Spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy. To gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of E2, the following end points of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) expression of iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and COX-2; (4) apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression); and (5) tissue TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels. In another set of experiments, the pretreatment or posttreatment with E2 significantly ameliorates the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). To elucidate whether the protective effects of E2 were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of E2. ICI 182,780 (500 microg/kg, s.c., 1 h before treatment with E2) significantly antagonized the effect of the E2 and abolished the protective effect against SCI. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that administration of E2 before SCI reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma.","estradiol"

Recent epidemiological trends suggest that SCIs in elderly women are increasing; however, the effects of menopause on estrogen-mediated neuroprotection are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17beta-estradiol and reproductive aging on motor function, neuronal death, and white matter sparing after SCI of post- and pre-menopausal rats. Two-month-old or 1- year-old female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with a silastic capsule containing 180 microg/mL of 17beta-estradiol or vehicle. Complete crush SCI at T8-9 was performed 1 week later. Additional animals of each age group were left ovary-intact but were spinal cord injured. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor test was performed. Spinal cords were collected on post-SCI days 1, 7, and 21, and processed for histological markers. Administration of 17beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats improved recovery of hind-limb locomotion, increased white matter sparing, and decreased apoptosis in both the post- and pre-menopausal rats. Also, ovary-intact 1-year-old rats did worse than ovary-intact 2-month-old rats, suggesting that endogenous estrogen confers neuroprotection in young rats, which is lost in older animals. Taken together, these data suggest that estrogen is neuroprotective in SCI and that the loss of endogenous estrogen-mediated neuroprotective seen in older rats can be attenuated with exogenous administration of 17beta-estradiol.","estradiol"

We examined the protective effect of estrogen on functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. 17beta-estradiol (3, 100, or 300 microg/kg) was administered intravenously 1-2 h prior to injury (pre-treatment), and animals were then subjected to a mild, weight-drop spinal cord contusion injury. Estradiol treatment significantly improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Fifteen to 30 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in estradiol-treated (100 microg/kg) rats when compared to vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion sizes increased progressively in either vehicle-treated or 17beta-estradiol-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with 17beta-estradiol, the lesion size was significantly reduced 18-28 days after SCI when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis revealed that apoptotic cell death peaked 24-48 h after injury. Also, SCI induced a marked increase in activated caspase-3 in the spinal cord, evident by 4 h after injury. However, administration of 17beta-estradiol significantly reduced the SCI-induced increase in apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activity after SCI. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol significantly increased expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, bcl-2 and bcl-x, after SCI while expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, bad and bax, was not affected by drug treatment. Finally, intravenous administration of 17beta-estradiol (100 microg/kg) immediately after injury (post-treatment) also significantly improved hind limb motor function 19-30 days after SCI compared to vehicle-treated controls. These data suggest that after SCI, 17 beta-estradiol treatment improved functional recovery in the injured rat, in part, by reducing apoptotic cell death.","estradiol"

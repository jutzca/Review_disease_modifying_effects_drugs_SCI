We present a synthesis of related data on lesion mechanisms in post-traumatic myelogenous disorders, namely some of the alcohols and their actions on the nervous system, with details on the influences exerted, in such afflictions, by the chronic consumption of ethanol. The subject is not frequently approached - according to a literature review with systematic elements, which we have done before - thus constituting a niche that deserves to be further explored. The applicative component of the article highlights statistical data resulted from a retrospective study regarding the specialized casuistry from the Neuromuscular Recovery Clinic of the ""Bagdasar Arseni"" Emergency Clinical Hospital, following the comparative analysis of two groups of patients with recent SCI: non-consumers - the control group (n=780) - and chronic ethanol consumers - the study group (n=225) - with the addition of a prospective pilot component. Data processing has been achieved with SPSS 24. The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) mean motor scores differ significantly (tests: Mann-Whitney and t) between the control and study group in favor of the second, both at admission (p<0.001) and at discharge (p<0.001). AIS mean sensitive scores differ between the two lots, and also in favor of the study, but statistically significant only at discharge (p=0.048); the difference at admission is not significant (p=0.51) - possibly because of alcoholic-nutritional polyneuropathy. These findings, with numerous related details, later presented in the text, are surprising, which requires further studies and attempts of understanding.","ethanol"

To overcome the hurdles and achieve improved functional recovery multiple aspects, it must be taken into account. Tissue engineering approaches by coalescing biomaterials and stem cells offer a promising future for treating spinal cord injury. Here we investigated human endometrial stem cells (hEnSCs) as our cell source. Electrospun poly ε-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were used for hEnSC adhesion and growth. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the attachment and survival of stem cells on the PCL scaffolds. The scaffold-stem cell construct was transplanted into the hemisected spinal cords of adult male rats. Crocin, an ethanol-extractable component of Crocus sativus L., was administered to rats for 15 consecutive days post injury. Neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration were investigated using immunohistochemical staining for neurofilament marker NF-H and luxol-fast blue (LFB) staining, respectively. TNF-α staining was performed to determine the inflammatory response in each group. Functional recovery was assessed via the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale. Results showed that PCL scaffolds seeded with hEnSCs restored the continuity of the damaged spinal cord and decreased cavity formation. Additionally, hEnSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to the functional recovery of the spinal cord. Hence, hEnSC-seeded PCL scaffolds may serve as promising transplants for spinal cord tissue engineering purposes. Furthermore, crocin had an augmenting effect on spinal cord regeneration and proved to exert neuroprotective effects on damaged neurons and may be further studied as a promising drug for spinal cord injury.","ethanol"

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine done 6 days after admission revealed bilaterally symmetrical hyperintensities involving the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and white matter, basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem on T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted images; similar hyperintensities were seen involving the swollen and edematous cervical spinal cord and cerebellar tonsillar herniation compressing the proximal cervical cord. Petechial hemorrhages were also noted within the brainstem. These features are compatible with toxic injury to the brain and cervical spinal cord. To our knowledge, the magnetic resonance imaging features of brain and spinal cord injury and cerebellar tonsillar herniation, secondary to isopropanol intoxication have not been reported in the published literature before.","ethanol"

Given this, an examination of whether blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is a potential determinant of survival and neurological and functional recovery after acute traumatic SCI was carried out. All patients who were enrolled in the Third National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-3) were included. The study population was divided into 'non-alcohol' (BAC equal to 0‰), 'legal' (BAC greater than 0 up to 0.8‰) and 'illegal' (BAC greater than 0.8‰) subgroups. Outcome measures included survival, NASCIS motor and sensory scores, NASCIS pain scores and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) determinants at baseline and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-SCI. Analyses were adjusted for major potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, trial protocol, Glasgow coma score, and cause, level and severity of SCI. Among 499 patients (423 males and 76 females; ages from 14 to 92 years), the mean BAC was 0.054 ± 0.006‰ (range 0-1). The survival at 1 year (94.4%) was not associated with the BAC (P = 0.374). Moreover, BAC was not significantly correlated with motor recovery (P > 0.166), sensory recovery (P > 0.323), change in pain score (P > 0.312) or functional recovery (P > 0.133) at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-SCI. Our results, for the first time, show that the BAC at emergency admission does not adversely affect the patients' mortality, neurological impairment or functional disability over the course of the first year after SCI.","ethanol"

The aim of this experimental study was to determine the effect of oleuropein aglycone, a hydrolysis product of oleuropein, in the inflammatory response, in particular in the secondary injury associated with the mouse model of spinal cord trauma. The injury was induced by application of vascular clips to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy in mice. Oleuropein aglycone was administered in mice (100 μg/kg, 40 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, 10% ethanol, i.p.) 1h and 6h after the trauma. The treatment with oleuropein aglycone significantly decreased: (1) histological damage, (2) motor recovery, (3) nuclear factor (NF)-κB expression and IKB-α degradation, (4) protein kinase A (PKA) activity and expression, (5) pro-inflammatory cytokines production such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), 6) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, (7) neutrophil infiltration, (8) lipid peroxidation, (9) nitrotyrosine and poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) formation, (10) glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels, (11) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, FAS ligand expression, Caspase 3, Bax and Bcl-2 expression). Thus, we propose that olive oil phenolic constituents such as oleuropein aglycone may be useful in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases.","ethanol"

Upregulation of MMPs activity is known to be required for the inflammatory cell infiltration after spinal cord injury (SCI) and most likely contributes to early blood spinal barrier disruption and inflammation, thereby leading to the impairment of functional recovery. Here, we examined the effect of ethanol extract of Bupleurum falcatum (BF) on functional recovery by inhibiting MMP-2 and -9 activation and inflammation after SCI. Rats received a moderate, weight-drop contusion injury to spinal cord were administered orally with BF at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 14 d and functional recovery was measured by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor open field behavioral rating test, inclined plane test and foot print analysis. To examine the neuroprotective effect of BF, TUNEL staining and counting were also performed. In addition, the expression and/or activation of MMP-2, MMP-9 and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were examined by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography using spinal cord tissue from 1 d after injury. Our data showed that BF significantly inhibited the expression and activation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 after SCI. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were also significantly attenuated by BF. Furthermore, BF reduced apoptotic cell death at 1 d after injury, thereby significantly reduced lesion volume and improved functional recovery. Taken together, these results suggest that BF can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for treating acute spinal injury.","ethanol"

Daily administration of EECP after the spinal cord injury ameliorated the locomotor function, which effect was accompanied by a reduced lesion size. Furthermore, the EECP suppressed iNOS gene expression, thus reducing NO generation, and also increased the expression level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 mRNAs in the lesion site, suggesting that the EECP reduced the inflammatory and apoptotic circumstances through attenuation of iNOS mRNA expression and facilitation of mRNA expression of neurotrophins in the injured spinal cord. These results suggest that Chinese propolis may become a promising tool for wide use in the nervous system for reducing the secondary neuronal damage following primary physical injury.","ethanol"

Microglia are activated after injury and produce a variety of proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, cyclooxygenase-2, and reactive oxygen species leading to apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of total ethanol extract of Scutellaria baicalensis (EESB), after SCI. Using primary microglial cultures, EESB treatment significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of such inflammatory mediators as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production were significantly attenuated by EESB treatment. For in vivo study, rats that had received a moderate spinal cord contusion injury at T9 received EESB orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg. EESB inhibited expression of proinflammatory factors and protein carbonylation and nitration after SCI. EESB also inhibited microglial activation at 4 h after injury. Furthermore, EESB significantly inhibited apoptotic cell death of neurons and oligodendrocytes and improved functional recovery after SCI. Lesion cavity and myelin loss were also reduced following EESB treatment. Thus, our data suggest that EESB significantly improve functional recovery by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress after injury.","ethanol"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Methylprednisolone (MP), by reducing edema and protecting the cell membrane against peroxidation, is the only pharmacological agent with a proven clinically beneficial effect on SCI. Melatonin, known as a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have an effect on lipid peroxidation following experimental SCI. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of MP and melatonin on neurological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological recovery. Female albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into five groups of 18 rats each and six rats for the control group. Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of MP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","ethanol"

The histologic changes of the damaged spinal cord were also examined at 7 days after SCI. After SCI, the levels of free iron and MDA were increased significantly and the modified Tarlov's score and inclined plane angle decreased significantly in groups B and D. In group C, the Tarlov's score and inclined plane angle were increased significantly at 7, 14 and 21 days, with histological improvement.

Ethanol-treated rats had significantly lower tissue levels of excitatory amino acids and higher levels of free fatty acids, thromboxane, and lactic acid than did controls. Tissue magnesium concentration was significantly reduced by trauma and recovered more slowly in ethanol-treated rats. Enhanced phospholipid hydrolysis with free fatty acid and thromboxane accumulation, increased release of excitatory amino acids, and decreased tissue magnesium levels may each serve to worsen secondary tissue damage and diminish neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury associated with acute alcohol intoxication.","ethanol"

In this study alcoholic intoxication neither caused depressed motor responsiveness in head-injured patients with high serum ethanol levels nor accounted for the motor examination in those exhibiting the flaccid state. Flaccidity was attributed principally to impaired ventilation in 4 patients, a major intracranial mass in 12, and a spinal cord injury in 1. Compared to the larger group of head-injured patients, the flaccid patients had a significantly greater incidence of hypercapnia (P less than 0.001), acidosis (P less than 0.01), and both elevated and uncontrollable intracranial pressure (ICP) (P less than 0.001). These findings and the high mortality rate (76%) in this study suggest that the magnitude of respiratory complications and the severity of mechanical brain injury are greater in flaccid patients. The flaccid patients undergoing surgical decompression for major intracranial mass lesions (11 cases) have all died and, although still small in number, this group may represent an important subset with a poor prognosis. Nonetheless, a protocol that encourages rapid radiological and electrophysiological assessment and vigorous surgical and ICP management until the probable cause of flaccidity is identified and treated has benefit. The flaccid state was reversed and a good recovery was attained after the restoration of blood pressure and/or ventilation in 2 patients who appeared to have sustained a very grave head injury. In another patient, absent somatosensory evoked potentials greatly facilitated the diagnosis of a spinal subdural hematoma. This program of prompt diagnosis and intense therapy did not result in a protracted course or undue numbers of severely brain-damaged survivors.","ethanol"

This study aimed to determine the effects and potential mechanism of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist extendin-4 (Ex-4) in SCI. Seventy-two male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, 2.5 μg Ex-4, and 10 μg Ex-4 groups. To induce SCI, a 10-g iron rod was dropped from a 20-mm height to the spinal cord surface. Ex-4 was administered via intraperitoneal injection immediately after surgery. Motor function evaluation with the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale indicated significantly increased scores (p < 0.01) in the Ex-4-treated groups, especially 10 μg, which demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Ex-4 after SCI. The light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Beclin 1 protein expression determined via western blot and the number of autophagy-positive neurons via immunofluorescence double labeling were increased by Ex-4, which supports promotion of autophagy (p < 0.01). The caspase-3 protein level and neuronal apoptosis via transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)/NeuN/DAPI double labeling were significantly reduced in the Ex-4-treated groups, which indicates anti-apoptotic effects (p < 0.01). Finally, histological assessment via Nissl staining demonstrated the Ex-4 groups exhibited a significantly greater number of surviving neurons and less cavity (p < 0.01). To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that Ex-4 significantly enhances motor function in rats after SCI, and these effects are associated with the promotion of autophagy and inhibition of apoptosis.","exenatide"

Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2 (SERCA2) plays an important role in regulating calcium homeostasis, which has been shown to inhibit apoptosis. Exendin-4 has been shown to inhibit the apoptosis of nerve cells in SCI, which can also improve SERCA2 expression. In this study, we sought to determine whether exendin-4 plays a protective role in a rat model of SCI via SERCA2. To investigate the effects of exendin-4 on SCI, a rat model of SCI was induced by a modified version of Allen's method. Spinal cord tissue sections from rats and western blot analysis were used to examine SERCA2 expression after treatment with the long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor exendin-4 or the SERCA2 antagonist 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CE). Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale and slanting board test. Cell apoptosis was increased with CE treatment and decreased with exendin-4 treatment. Upregulation of SERCA2 in female rats with SCI resulted in an improvement of motor function scores and histological changes. These findings suggest that exendin-4 plays a protective role in a rat model of SCI through SERCA2 via inhibition of apoptosis. Existing drugs targeting SERCA2 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCI.","exenatide"

Gemfibrozil, an agonist of PPAR-α, is a FDA approved drug for hyperlipidemia and has been shown to inhibit clinical signs in a rodent model of multiple sclerosis. Since many studies have shown improved outcome from spinal cord injury (SCI) by anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents, we tested the efficacy of oral gemfibrozil given before or after SCI for promoting tissue preservation and behavioral recovery after spinal contusion injury in mice. Unfortunately, the results were contrary to our hypothesis; in our first attempt, gemfibrozil treatment exacerbated locomotor deficits and increased tissue pathology after SCI. In subsequent experiments, the behavioral effects were not replicated but histological outcomes again were worse. We also tested the efficacy of a different PPAR-α agonist, fenofibrate, which also modulates immune responses and is beneficial in several neurodegenerative disease models. Fenofibrate treatment did not improve recovery, although there was a slight trend for a modest increase in histological tissue sparing. Based on our results, we conclude that PPAR-α agonists yield either no effect or worsen recovery from spinal cord injury, at least at the doses and the time points of drug delivery tested here. Further, patients sustaining spinal cord injury while taking gemfibrozil might be prone to exacerbated tissue damage.","fenofibrate"

The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed. This 52-yr-old patient was slightly overweight and was on fenofibrate for hypercholesterolemia. He had no history of cardiovascular disease. Arterial blood pressure was overall well maintained except for a very transient hypotension at surgical incision. Blood loss was moderate and did not require transfusion. Soon after recovery, the patient complained of paresthesia in both legs and neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb hypoesthesia, compatible with an incomplete medullar syndrome at the level of T12-L1. On postoperative day one, a plain magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated a hyperintense signal in the spinal cord from T8 to T9 on T2-weighted images consistent with ischemia of the spinal cord whereas the heterogeneous aspect of the spinal cord was due to an unusually high fat content of the epidural space. Neurological signs improved progressively and one week later the patient had recovered normal sensory functions of both lower limbs. Although arterial ischemia is the most common cause of postoperative spinal cord injury, other mechanisms may be invoked. We raise the possibility that a combination of intraoperative risk factors (hypotension, excessive postural changes) with anatomic predispositions (increased epidural venous pressure or fat content, previous bone disease) can produce arterial and/or venous ischemia of the spinal cord.","fenofibrate"

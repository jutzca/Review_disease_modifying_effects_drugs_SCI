Herein, we compare the effects of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on forelimb motor function recovery after a C4 bilateral dorsal funiculi crush in adult female rats. After injury, single pellet reaching performance and forelimb muscle activity decreased in all rats. From 1 to 6 weeks after injury, rats were tested on these tasks with and without buspirone (1-2 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (1-5 mg/kg). Reaching and grasping success rates of buspirone-treated rats improved rapidly within 2 weeks after injury and plateaued over the next 4 weeks of testing. Electromyography (EMG) from selected muscles in the dominant forelimb showed that buspirone-treated animals used new reaching strategies to achieve success after the injury. However, forelimb performance dramatically decreased within 2 weeks of buspirone withdrawal. In contrast, fluoxetine treatment resulted in a more progressive rate of improvement in forelimb performance over 8 weeks after injury. Neither buspirone nor fluoxetine significantly improved quadrupedal locomotion on the horizontal ladder test. The improved accuracy of reaching and grasping, patterns of muscle activity, and increased excitability of spinal motor-evoked potentials after buspirone administration reflect extensive reorganization of connectivity within and between supraspinal and spinal sensory-motor netxcopy works. Thus, both serotonergic drugs, buspirone and fluoxetine, neuromodulated these networks to physiological states that enabled markedly improved forelimb function after cervical spinal cord injury.","fluoxetine"

While medications and physical rehabilitation are prescribed to alleviate spastic symptoms, the insufficiency of their effects remains an important problem to be addressed. Given the challenges associated with increasing the dose of medication, we hypothesized that a combination therapy with medication and physical rehabilitation can be effective. Therefore, we examined the effects of treadmill training (TMT) along with serotonergic medication using a spastic rat model after contusive injury. Spasticity-strong SCI rats were selected 4 weeks after SCI and received one of the following interventions for 2 weeks: only TMT, TMT with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), TMT with cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist), only fluoxetine, or only cyproheptadine. We performed the swimming test to quantify the frequency of spastic behaviors. We also evaluated hindlimb locomotor functions every week. At the end of the intervention, we examined the Hoffman reflex from the plantar muscle and the immunoreactivity of the 5-HT2A receptor in spinal cord tissues. While the TMT group and cyproheptadine-treated groups showed decreased spastic behaviors and reduction in spinal hyperreflexia, the fluoxetine-treated group showed the opposite effect, even with TMT. Moreover, TMT suppressed the expression of the 5-HT2A receptor in the lumbar spinal motor neurons, while cyproheptadine treatment did not change it. We did not observe any differences in locomotor functions between the groups. Taken together, our findings indicate that TMT and cyproheptadine significantly alleviated spastic symptoms, but did not show synergistic or additive effects.","fluoxetine"

Previous work has described adaptations in spinal systems that might underlie this hyperexcitability, including an increase in constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors in spinal motoneurons. That work, however, examined adaptations following complete transection SCI, whereas SCI in humans is usually anatomically and functionally incomplete. We therefore evaluated whether constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors contributes to reflex hyperexcitability in an incomplete compression model of SCI and to spasms in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm that 5-HT2C receptor constitutive activity contributes to reflex excitability after incomplete SCI. We also evaluated whether constitutive activity could be altered by manipulation of neural activity levels after SCI, testing the hypothesis that it reflects homeostatic processes acting to maintain spinal excitability. We decreased neural activity after SCI by administering baclofen and increased activity by administering the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. We found that drug administration produced minimal alterations in in vivo locomotor function or reflex excitability. Similarly, we found that neither baclofen nor fluoxetine altered the contribution of constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors to reflexes after SCI, although the contribution of 5-HT2C receptors to reflex activity was altered after SSRIs. These results confirm the importance of constitutive activity in 5-HT2C receptors to spinal hyperexcitability following SCI in the clinically relevant case of incomplete SCI but suggest that this activity is not driven by homeostatic processes that act to maintain overall levels of spinal excitability.NEW & NOTEWORTHY After spinal cord injury (SCI), most people will develop muscle spasms below their level of injury that can severely impact function. In this work, we examine the adaptations that occur within the spinal cord after SCI that contribute to these motor dysfunctions. We also evaluate one hypothesis about how these adaptations develop, which will potentially lead to intervention strategies to improve functional outcomes in persons with SCI.","fluoxetine"

Here we investigated whether a low-dose of fluoxetine (1 mg/kg) and vitamin C (100 mg/kg), separately not possessing any protective effect, prevents BSCB disruption and improves functional recovery when combined. After a moderate contusion injury at T9 in rat, a low-dose of fluoxetine and vitamin C, or the combination of both was administered intraperitoneally immediately after SCI and further treated once a day for 14 d. Co-treatment with fluoxetine and vitamin C significantly attenuated BSCB permeability at 1 d after SCI. When only fluoxetine or vitamin C was treated after injury, however, there was no effect on BSCB disruption. Co-treatment with fluoxetine and vitamin C also significantly inhibited the expression and activation of MMP-9 at 8 h and 1 d after injury, respectively, and the infiltration of neutrophils (at 1 d) and macrophages (at 5 d) and the expression of inflammatory mediators (at 2 h, 6 h, 8 h or 24 h after injury) were significantly inhibited by co-treatment with fluoxetine and vitamin C. Furthermore, the combination of fluoxetine and vitamin C attenuated apoptotic cell death at 1 d and 5 d and improved locomotor function at 5 weeks after SCI. These results demonstrate the synergistic effect combination of low-dose fluoxetine and vitamin C on BSCB disruption after SCI and furthermore support the effectiveness of the combination treatment regimen for the management of acute SCI.","fluoxetine"

It has been demonstrated that activation of the serotonin system can promote locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. The present study was designed to investigate whether serotonergic activation can improve respiratory function during the chronic injury state. Bilateral diaphragm electromyogram and tidal volume were measured in anesthetized and spontaneously breathing adult rats at 8 wk post-C2Hx or C2 laminectomy. A bolus intravenous injection of a serotonin precursor [5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 10 mg/kg], a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine, 10 mg/kg), or a potent agonist for serotonin 2A receptors (TCB-2, 0.05 mg/kg) was used to activate the serotonergic system. Present results demonstrated that 5-HTP and TCB-2, but not fluoxetine, significantly increased the inspiratory activity of the diaphragm electromyogram ipsilateral to the lesion for at least 30 min in C2Hx animals, but not in animals that received sham surgery. However, the tidal volume was not increased after administration of 5-HTP or TCB-2, indicating that the enhancement of ipsilateral diaphragm activity is not associated with improvement of the tidal volume. These results suggest that exogenous activation of the serotonergic system can specifically enhance the ipsilateral diaphragmatic motor outputs, but this approach may not be sufficient to improve respiratory functional recovery following chronic cervical spinal injury.","fluoxetine"

When lesions are incomplete, promoting spinal cord plasticity might be a useful strategy to elicit functional recovery. Here we investigated whether long-term fluoxetine administration in the drinking water, a treatment recently demonstrated to optimize brain plasticity in several pathological conditions, promotes motor recovery in rats that received a C4 dorsal funiculus crush. We show that fluoxetine administration markedly improved motor functions compared to controls in several behavioral paradigms. The improved functional effects correlated positively with significant sprouting of intact corticospinal fibers and a modulation of the excitation/inhibition balance. Our results suggest a potential application of fluoxetine treatment as a non invasive therapeutic strategy for SCI-associated neuropathologies.","fluoxetine"

To evaluate the influences of antidepressant treatment, treadmill gait training and a combination of these therapies in rats with experimental, acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Brazil. 48 Wistar rats were given standardized SCI; rats were then randomly assigned to four treatment groups: (1) motor rehabilitation therapy for 1 hour daily (gait training); (2) daily treatment with the antidepressant, fluoxetine (0.3 ml per 100 g intraperitoneally), beginning 24 h after the trauma; (3) combined fluoxetine treatment and gait training, or (4) untreated (controls). Neurological recovery was tested with the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 ,35 and 42 days after injury. Moreover, on day 42, all rats underwent a motor-evoked potential test (MEP); then, after euthanasia, histopathological evaluation was conducted in the area of SCI. Based on the BBB scale, the combined treatment group showed significantly greater improvement compared with the other three groups, from the 14th to the 42nd day of observation. The MEP revealed that all treated groups showed significant improvement compared with the control group (P<0.02 for latency and P<0.01 for amplitude). Our results indicated that a combination of antidepressant and treadmill gait training was superior to either treatment alone for improving functional deficits in rats with experimental, acute SCI.","fluoxetine"

Recent evidence indicates that fluoxetine, an anti-depressant drug, is shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischaemic brain injury, but the precise mechanism underlying its protective effects is largely unknown. Here, we show that fluoxetine prevented blood-spinal cord barrier disruption via inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activation after spinal cord injury. After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with an infinite horizon impactor in the mouse, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and further administered once a day for indicated time points. Fluoxetine treatment significantly inhibited messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, 9 and 12 after spinal cord injury. By zymography and fluorimetric enzyme activity assay, fluoxetine also significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease 2 and matrix metalloprotease 9 activities after injury. In addition, fluoxetine inhibited nuclear factor kappa B-dependent matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in bEnd.3, a brain endothelial cell line, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Fluoxetine also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as zona occludens 1 and occludin after injury in vivo as well as in bEnd.3 cultures. By immunofluorescence staining, fluoxetine prevented the breakdown of the tight junction integrity in endothelial cells of blood vessel after injury. Furthermore, fluoxetine inhibited the messenger RNA expression of chemokines such as Groα, MIP1α and 1β, and prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators after injury. Finally, fluoxetine attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved locomotor function after injury. Thus, our results indicate that fluoxetine improved functional recovery in part by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease activation and preventing blood-spinal cord barrier disruption after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our study suggests that fluoxetine may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity following ischaemic brain injury and spinal cord injury in humans.","fluoxetine"

Despite the fact that patients with depression are often prescribed both, the effects of the exercise and fluoxetine antidepressant treatment used in combination are unknown. Using C57Bl/10 female mice, BDNF protein, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) protein and neurogenesis were measured in the hippocampus after 21 days of wheel running, 21 days of fluoxetine antidepressant therapy (daily i.p. injections of 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg) and the combination of the two. BDNF protein and cytogenesis/neurogenesis increased in the hippocampus with fluoxetine (high dose), but not wheel running. Hippocampal IGF-1 protein did not change with either treatment. There were no synergistic effects of combining exercise and fluoxetine treatment. Recent reports have also shown that exercise induces molecular mechanisms that benefit the spinal cord and can improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI); therefore, we repeated the assays in the spinal cord. Results showed that BDNF, IGF-1 and neurogenesis behave independently in the hippocampus and spinal cord. BDNF protein did not change in the spinal cord with either wheel running or fluoxetine treatment. Spinal cord IGF-1 protein did not change with wheel running, but it decreased with fluoxetine (high dose). Furthermore, spinal cord cytogenesis decreased with fluoxetine treatment. The combined wheel running and fluoxetine groups did not show synergistic results. Thus, the hippocampus and the spinal cord respond in distinct ways to wheel running and fluoxetine, and a prior induction of BDNF, IGF-1 or cytogenesis is unlikely to be the mechanism for wheel running providing a margin of protection against SCI.","fluoxetine"

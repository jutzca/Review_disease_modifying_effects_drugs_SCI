Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) is largely responsible for the early disruption of the blood spinal cord barrier. This system initiates macrophage infiltration and degradation of myelin, which plays a pivotal role in how NP occurs. In a recent study, we demonstrated that folic acid (FA) treatment to cSCI rats reduced NP and improved functional recovery by repressing MMP-2 expression. We hypothesize that MMP-2 expression is suppressed because FA actively methylates the DNA sequence that encodes for the MMP-2 protein. However, modulation of MMP-2 expression for alleviation of NP is only pertinent to the mid- to late-phase of injury. Therefore, we need to explore alternate therapeutic methods to target the early- to mid-phase of injury to wholly alleviate NP. Furthering our previous findings on inhibiting MMP-2 expression by FA in mid- and late- phase following cSCI in rats, we hypothesized that FA will methylate and suppress MMP-9 expression during the early- phase, day 1, 3, 7 post cSCI and mid- phase (day 18 post cSCI), in comparison with MMP-2 expression during mid- and the late-phase of cSCI. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250-270g) underwent cSCI, using a NYU impactor, with 12.5 gm/cm injury. The spinal cord-injured animals were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a standardized dose of FA (80 μg/kg body weight) on day 1, 2, 3, prior to cSCI, followed by daily injection up to 14 or 17 days post-cSCI in different experiments. Animals were euthanized on day 1, 3, 7 post cSCI (early- phase), day 18 post cSCI (mid- phase), and day 42 post cSCI (late-phase) and the epicenter region of injured spinal cord were harvested for MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression analysis by Western blots technique. i) During early-phase on day 1, 3, and 7, the quantitation displayed no statistical significance in MMP-9 expression, between water- and FA- injected rats. ii) On day 18 post-cSCI, FA significantly modulates the expression of MMP-9 (p = 0.043) iii) Comparing results with MMP-2 expression and inhibition, FA significantly modulates the expression of MMP-2 on day 18 post cSCI (FA- and water-injected rats (p = 0.003). iv) In addition, FA significantly modulates the expression of MMP-2 on day 42 post-cSCI comparing FA- and water- injected rat groups (p = 0.034). We report that FA administration results in alleviating cSCI-induced NP by inhibiting MMP-9 in the proposed mid- phase of cSCI. However, FA administration resulted in MMP-2 decline during both mid- through late- phase following cSCI. Our study elucidates a new phase of cSCI, the mid-phase. We conclude that further investigation on discovering and quantifying the nature of the mid- phase of SCI injury is needed.","folic_acid"

The authors hypothesized that exposure to nitrous oxide impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery after central nervous system injury. The consequences of single and serial in vivo nitrous oxide exposures on axon regeneration in four experimental male rat models of nervous system injury were measured: in vitro axon regeneration in cell culture after in vivo nitrous oxide administration, in vivo axon regeneration after sharp spinal cord injury, in vivo axon regeneration after sharp optic nerve injury, and in vivo functional recovery after blunt contusion spinal cord injury. In vitro axon regeneration 48 h after a single in vivo 70% N2O exposure is less than half that in the absence of nitrous oxide (mean ± SD, 478 ± 275 um; n = 48) versus 210 ± 152 um (n = 48; P < 0.0001). A single exposure to 80% N2O inhibits the beneficial effects of folic acid on in vivo axonal regeneration after sharp spinal cord injury (13.4 ± 7.1% regenerating neurons [n = 12] vs. 0.6 ± 0.7% regenerating neurons [n = 4], P = 0.004). Serial 80% N2O administration reverses the benefit of folic acid on in vivo retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after sharp optic nerve injury (1277 ± 180 regenerating retinal ganglion cells [n = 7] vs. 895 ± 164 regenerating retinal ganglion cells [n = 7], P = 0.005). Serial 80% N2O exposures reverses the benefit of folic acid on in vivo functional recovery after blunt spinal cord contusion (estimate for fixed effects ± standard error of the estimate: folic acid 5.60 ± 0.54 [n = 9] vs. folic acid + 80% N2O 5.19 ± 0.62 [n = 7], P < 0.0001). These data indicate that nitrous oxide can impair the ability of central nervous system neurons to regenerate axons after sharp and blunt trauma.","folic_acid"

A scoping review of the literature of common spinal disorders was performed through September 2016. To identify search terms, we developed 3 terminology groups for case definitions: 1) spinal pain of unknown origin, 2) spinal syndromes, and 3) spinal pathology. We used a comprehensive strategy to search PubMed for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials for risk and prognostic factors and cross-sectional studies describing associations and comorbidities. Of 3,453 candidate papers, 145 met study criteria and were included in this review. Risk factors were reported for group 1: non-specific low back pain (smoking, overweight/obesity, negative recovery expectations), non-specific neck pain (high job demands, monotonous work); group 2: degenerative spinal disease (workers' compensation claim, degenerative scoliosis), and group 3: spinal tuberculosis (age, imprisonment, previous history of tuberculosis), spinal cord injury (age, accidental injury), vertebral fracture from osteoporosis (type 1 diabetes, certain medications, smoking), and neural tube defects (folic acid deficit, anti-convulsant medications, chlorine, influenza, maternal obesity). A range of comorbidities was identified for spinal disorders. Many associated factors for common spinal disorders identified in this study are modifiable. The most common spinal disorders are co-morbid with general health conditions, but there is a lack of clarity in the literature differentiating which conditions are merely comorbid versus ones that are risk factors. Modifiable risk factors present opportunities for policy, research, and public health prevention efforts on both the individual patient and community levels. Further research into prevention interventions for spinal disorders is needed to address this gap in the literature.","folic_acid"

Recent studies have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP2 play a critical role in inducing NP following SCI. Promoter methylation of MMPs is known to suppress their transcription and reduce NP. In this context, it has been shown in rodents that folic acid (FA), an FDA approved dietary supplement and key methyl donor in the central nervous system (CNS), increases axonal regeneration and repair of injured CNS in part via methylation. Based on above observations, in this study, we test whether FA could decrease MMP2 expression and thereby decrease SCI-induced NP. Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250-270 g received contusion spinal cord injuries (cSCIs) with a custom spinal cord impactor device that drops a 10 g weight from a height of 12.5 mm. The injured rats received either i.p. injections of FA (80 µg/kg) or water (control) 3 days prior and 17 days post-cSCI (mid phase) or for 3 days pre-cSCI and 14 days post-cSCI ending on the 42nd day of cSCI (late phase). The functional neurological deficits due to cSCI were then assessed by Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores either on post-impaction days 0 through 18 post-cSCI (mid phase) or on days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 (late phase). Baseline measurements were taken the day before starting treatments. Thermal hyperalgesia (TH) testing for pain was performed on 4 days pre-cSCI (baseline data) and on days 18, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post-cSCI. Following TH testing, animals were euthanized and spinal cords harvested for MMP-2 expression analysis. The FA-treated groups showed higher BBB scores during mid phase (day 18) and in late phase (day 42) of injury compared to controls, suggesting enhanced functional recovery. There is a transient decline in TH in animals from the FA-treated group compared to controls when tested on days 18, 21, 28, and 35, indicative of a decrease in NP. However, when tested 25 days after stopping FA administration on day 42 of cSCI, no significant difference in TH was observed between FA-treated and control animals. Western blot analysis of the injured spinal cord from FA-treated animals showed significant decline in MMP2 expression compared to spinal cord samples from water-treated controls. Together, these data suggest that FA could alleviate NP and improve functional recovery post-SCI, possibly by reducing the expression of MMP2. Further studies will open up a novel and easy natural therapy, ideal for clinical translation with minimal side effects, for managing SCI-induced NP. Such studies might also throw light on a possible epigenetic mechanism in FA-induced recovery after SCI.","folic_acid"

Among the leading mechanisms associated to cell death after SCI, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis are considered potential targets to prevent tissue damage. We recently reported that dapsone an anti-inflammatory drug, decreases the activity of myeloperoxidase, lipid peroxidation, improve neurological function and increase the amount of spared tissue after SCI in rats. In this study, we characterized the anti-apoptotic effect of dapsone administered at 12.5 mg/kg/24 h dose, starting at 3 and 5 h after SCI. We monitored the activity of caspases-8, 9, and 3 and quantitated Annexin V and TUNEL positive cells in the core of the lesion. Results showed increased activities of caspase-8, 9 and 3 at 72 h by SCI to reach increments of 69, 143 and 293 %, respectively, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, dapsone, administered at 3 and 5 after SCI, reduced caspase-8 activity by 36 and 44 % respectively, whereas the activity of caspase-9 was diminished by 37 %. Likewise, the activity of caspase-3 showed a decrease of 38 %. Finally, both Annexin V and TUNEL-positive cells were significantly reduced by DDS as compared to untreated SCI animals.

The inflammatory response plays a key role in this pathology. Recent evidence suggests that myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme produced and released by neutrophils, is of special importance in spreading tissue damage. Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is an irreversible inhibitor of MPO. Recently, we demonstrated, in a model of brain ischemia/reperfusion, that dapsone has antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. The effects of dapsone on MPO activity, lipid peroxidation (LP) processes, motor function recovery, and the amount of spared tissue were evaluated in a rat model of SCI. MPO activity had increased 24.5-fold 24 hr after SCI vs. the sham group, and it had diminished by 38% and 19% in the groups treated with dapsone at 3 and 5 hr after SCI, respectively. SCI increased LP by 45%, and this increase was blocked by dapsone. In rats treated with dapsone, a significant motor function recovery (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score, BBB) was observed beginning during the first week of evaluation and continuing until the end of the study. Spontaneous recovery 8 weeks after SCI was 9.2 ± 1.12, whereas, in the dapsone-treated groups, it reached 13.6 ± 1.04 and 12.9 ± 1.17. Spared tissue increased by 42% and 33% in the dapsone-treated groups (3 and 5 hr after SCI, respectively) vs. SCI without treatment. Dapsone significantly prevented mortality. The results show that inhibition of MPO by dapsone significantly protected the spinal cord from tissue damage and enhanced motor recovery after SCI.","folic_acid"

We hypothesized that folic acid would reduce brain injury and improve neurological outcome in a neonatal piglet model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), using 4 experimental groups of 3- to 5-day-old female piglets. Two groups were intubated, anesthetized and had moderate brain injury induced by rapid axial head rotation without impact. One group of injured (Inj) animals received folic acid (Fol; 80 μg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 15 min following injury, and then daily for 6 days (Inj + Fol; n = 7). The second group of injured animals received an IP injection of saline (Sal) at the same time points (Inj + Sal; n = 8). Two uninjured (Uninj) control groups (Uninj + Fol, n = 8; Uninj + Sal, n = 7) were intubated, anesthetized and received folic acid (80 μg/kg) or saline by IP injection at the same time points as the injured animals following a sham procedure. Animals underwent neurobehavioral and cognitive testing on days 1 and 4 following injury to assess behavior, memory, learning and problem solving. Serum folic acid and homocysteine levels were collected prior to injury and again before euthanasia. The piglets were euthanized 6 days following injury, and their brains were perfusion fixed for histological analysis. Folic acid levels were significantly higher in both Fol groups on day 6. Homocysteine levels were not affected by treatment. On day 1 following injury, the Inj + Fol group showed significantly more exploratory interest, and better motor function, learning and problem solving compared to the Inj + Sal group. Inj + Fol animals had a significantly lower cognitive composite dysfunction score compared to all other groups on day 1. These functional improvements were not seen on day 4 following injury. Axonal injury measured by β-amyloid precursor protein staining 6 days after injury was not affected by treatment. These results suggest that folic acid may enhance early functional recovery in this piglet model of pediatric head injury. This is the first study to describe the application of complex functional testing to assess an intervention outcome in a swine model of TBI.","folic_acid"

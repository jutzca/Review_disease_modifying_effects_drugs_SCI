Despite recent advances in neurosciences, the treatment efficacy on SCI patients remains unsatisfactory, mainly due to the poor accumulation, short retention, and lack of controlled release of therapeutics in lesion tissue. Herein, an injured spinal cord targeting prodrug polymer micelle is built. An esterase-responsive bond is used to link apocynin (APO) monomer, because of the enhanced esterase activity found in microglia cells after activation, which ensures a controlled degradation of APO prodrug (Allyloxypolyethyleneglycol-b-poly [2-(((4-acetyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)carbonyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate], APEG-PAPO or PAPO) by activated microglia cells. A scar tissue-homing peptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) is introduced to the PAPO to endow the polymer micelle the lesion tissue-targeting ability. As a result, this CAQK-modified prodrug micelle (cPAM) exhibits an improved accumulation and prolonged retention in lesion tissue compared to the control micelle. The cPAM also leads to superior tissue protection and sustained motor function recovery than the control groups in a mouse model of SCI. In conclusion, the cPAM induces an effective treatment of SCI by the lesion tissue specific delivery of the prodrug polymer via its robust scar binding effect, making the scar tissue a drug releasing platform for sustained treatment of SCI.","glutamine"

Still, there is no robust conceptual design to regenerate the damaged axon after spinal injury. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that human gingival derived neuronal stem cells (GNSCs) transplants in the injectable caffeic acid bioconjugated hydrogel (CBGH) helps to bridge the cavity and promote the engraftment and repopulation of transplants in the injured spinal tissue. Our study reports that the bioluminescence imaging in vivo imaging system (IVIS) provides a satisfactory progression in CBGH-GNSCs transplants compare to lesion control and CBGH alone. Immune regulators interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, neutrophil elastase are decreased, IL-10 is increased. Likewise, immunostaining (TAU/TUJ-1, SOX-2/NeuN, MAP-2/PSD93, NSE, S100b, and GFAP) shown repopulated cells. Also, TRA-1-81 expression confirms the absence of immune rejection in the CBGH-GNSCs transplants. However, locomotor recovery test, gene (IL-6, CASPASE3, p14-ARF, VEGF, LCAM, BDNF, NT3, NGN2, TrKc, FGF2, Sox-2, TUJ-1, MAP-2, Nestin, and NeuN) and protein expression (TAU, TUJ-1, SOX-2 MAP-2, PSD93, NeuN, TRA-1-81, GFAP, TAU, and MBP) shows functional improvements in the CBGH-GNSCs group. Further, GABA and glutamine level demonstrates the new synaptic vesicle formation. Hence, the CBGH scaffold enhances GNSCs transplants to restore the injured spinal tissue.","glutamine"

In this study, we aim to develop a clinically feasible way for targeted delivery of multiple drugs with different physiochemical properties to the SCI site, detail the underlying mechanism of neural recovery, and detect any synergistic effect related to combination therapy. Methods: Liposomes (LIP) modified with a scar-targeted tetrapeptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) were first constructed to simultaneously encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and then were further added into a thermosensitive heparin-modified poloxamer hydrogel (HP) with affinity-bound acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF-HP) for local administration into the SCI site (CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP) in a rat model. In vivo fluorescence imaging was used to examine the specificity of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX binding to the injured site. Multiple comprehensive evaluations including biotin dextran amine anterograde tracing and magnetic resonance imaging were used to detect any synergistic effects and the underlying mechanisms of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP both in vivo (rat SCI model) and in vitro (primary neuron). Results: The multiple drugs were effectively delivered to the injured site. The combined application of GFs and DTX supported neuro-regeneration by improving neuronal survival and plasticity, rendering a more permissive extracellular matrix environment with improved regeneration potential. In addition, our combination therapy promoted axonal regeneration via moderation of microtubule function and mitochondrial transport along the regenerating axon. Conclusion: This novel multifunctional therapeutic strategy with a scar-homing delivery system may offer promising translational prospects for the clinical treatment of SCI.","glutamine"

This study aimed to explore the protective effects of Baicalin on rats with spinal cord injury (SCI) and its mechanism of action. The recovery of spinal cord nerve function in rats was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score and the combine behavioral score (CBS). The expressions of cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Expressions of inflammation-related proteins were detected by Western blot. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed for serum metabolites. The BBB and CBS score results showed that Baicalin had a certain improvement on rats with SCI. SCI symptoms were significantly improved in low-dose and high-dose groups. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the SCI group were significantly increased. The expressions of NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, p-IκBα, and IKKα in the SCI group showed the opposite trend compared with the low-dose and high-dose groups. Compared with the sham group, glutamine, levels of 3-OH-butyrate, N-acetylaspartate, and glutathione were significantly reduced, and the levels of glutamate and betaine were significantly increased in the SCI group. When Baicalin was administered, the contents of glutamine synthase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) were significantly reduced, indicating that Baicalin had the effect of improving GS and GLS. Baicalin has protective effects on improving SCI and lower extremity motor function, has a significant anti-inflammatory effect, and regulates the serum metabolic disorder caused by SCI in rats.","glutamine"

The extent to which these changes have a prognostic value in the clinical recovery after surgical treatment is not yet known. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to test 2 primary hypotheses. 1) Based on evidence of corticospinal and spinocerebellar, rubro-, or reticulospinal tract degeneration/dysfunction during chronic spinal cord compression, the authors hypothesized that the metabolic profile of the primary motor cortices (M1s) and cerebellum, respectively, would be altered in patients with CSM, and these alterations would be associated with the extent of the neurological disabilities. 2) Considering that damage and/or plasticity in the remote motor system may contribute to clinical recovery, they hypothesized that M1 and cerebellar metabolic profiles would predict, at least in part, surgical outcome. METHODS The metabolic profile, consisting of N-acetylaspartate (NAA; marker of neuronal integrity), myoinositol (glial marker), choline (cell membrane synthesis and turnover), and glutamate-glutamine (glutamatergic system), of the M1 hand/arm territory in each hemisphere and the cerebellum vermis was investigated prior to surgery in 21 patients exhibiting weakness of the upper extremities and/or gait abnormalities. Age- and sex-matched controls (n = 16) were also evaluated to estimate the pre-CSM metabolic profile of these areas. Correlation and regression analyses were performed between preoperative metabolite levels and clinical status 6 months after surgery. RESULTS Relative to controls, patients exhibited significantly higher levels of choline but no difference in the levels of other metabolites across M1s. Cerebellar metabolite levels were indistinguishable from control levels. Certain metabolites-myo-inositol and choline across M1s, NAA and glutamate-glutamine in the left M1, and myo-inositol and glutamate-glutamine in the cerebellum-were significantly associated with postoperative clinical status. These associations were greatly improved by including preoperative clinical metrics into the models. Likewise, these models improved the predictive value of preoperative clinical metrics alone. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary findings demonstrate relationships between the preoperative metabolic profiles of two remote motor areas and surgical outcome in CSM patients. Including preoperative clinical metrics in the models significantly strengthened the predictive value. Although further studies are needed, this investigation provides an important starting point to understand how the changes upstream from the injury may influence the effect of spinal cord decompression.","glutamine"

Glutamine supplementation improves clinical outcomes, but its effects on muscle function after SCI are unknown. The benefits of glutamine in non-skeletal muscle tissues involve elevated heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp25, but the muscle response may differ because it is the largest contributor to plasma glutamine. We tested the hypothesis that glutamine preserves muscle function after SCI and that this is associated with increased heat shock protein and reduced inflammatory factors, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Changes in plantarflexor force, fatigability and total myofibrillar, Hsp70, Hsp25, IL-6 and TNFα muscle protein levels were measured 7 days after sham or spinal cord transection surgery in mice receiving daily placebo or glutamine. Compared with placebo, after SCI glutamine significantly attenuated the reductions in maximal isometric force (0.22 ± 0.01 versus 0.31 ± 0.03 N, respectively) and fatigue resistance (34 ± 4 versus 59 ± 4% of initial force, respectively). Glutamine significantly ameliorated the loss of myofibrillar protein with spinal cord transection. Spinal cord transection was associated with decreased Hsp70 and Hsp25 with glutamine only (45 ± 3 and 44 ± 5% of placebo, respectively). Glutamine significantly reduced spinal cord transection-associated increases in IL-6 and TNFα compared with placebo (38 ± 6 and 37 ± 8% of placebo, respectively). Functionally, early reductions in contractile protein, force and fatigue resistance after SCI were reversed with glutamine. Spinal cord transection-associated reductions in Hsp70, Hsp25, IL-6 and TNFα with glutamine versus placebo suggest lower stress in the muscle, possibly related to a reduced need to produce glutamine. These findings support glutamine as a therapeutic intervention to accelerate recovery of muscle function after SCI.","glutamine"

Glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in oxidant scavenging. Maintenance of GSH concentrations after SCI lessens secondary injury and improves recovery. Since glutamine promotes GSH synthesis, this nonessential amino acid was examined for therapeutic potential. Denervation alters the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms within skeletal muscles. The hypotheses of this study were that glutamine administration to SCI rats would lead to improved functional recovery and more preserved MHC phenotypes in representative locomotor muscles. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: healthy, sham with laminectomy, laminectomized SCI untreated, and laminectomized SCI treated with glutamine. Functional performance was measured weekly for 6 wk using Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale and angle board methods. MHC composition of rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was determined using SDS-PAGE. Glutamine-treated rats had significantly higher angle board scores (P < 0.001) and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores (P < 0.01) than untreated SCI rats. Soleus of healthy rats contained 94% type 1 myosin isoform. Treated rats maintained 68%, which was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than 28% in untreated rats. The extensor digitorum longus of healthy rats contained 55% type 2b myosin. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in this isoform following SCI, but no significant difference between treated and untreated groups. There were strong correlations between higher functional scores and more preserved MHC phenotypes. Our findings suggest glutamine improves functional recovery and helps preserve myosin profile by reducing secondary SCI, thereby maintaining more nerves.","glutamine"

(2) To relate any altered biochemistry with the physiological changes in corticospinal function seen after spinal cord injury. A group of six patients with incomplete spinal cord injury who showed good recovery of motor function were selected. The patients were compared with five healthy control subjects. Electromyographic (EMG) responses of thenar muscles to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex showed that inhibition of cortical output was weaker in the patients than the controls. Proton MRS data were collected from a plane at the level of the centrum semiovale. Two 4.5 cm3 voxels in the motor cortex and a third voxel in the ipsilateral occipital cortex were examined in the patients and control subjects. The mean level of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), expressed relative to the creatine (Cr) peak (NAA/Cr), was significantly increased in the motor cortex of the patients compared with their ipsilateral occipital cortex or either cortical area in the controls. No differences between patients and controls were seen for any of the other metabolite peaks (choline (Cho), glutamate/glutamine (Glx) or the aspartate component of NAA (AspNAA)) relative to Cr. Choline relative to Cr (Cho/Cr) was higher in the motor cortex of the control subjects than in their ipsilateral occipital cortex. This difference was not present in the patients. Raised NAA/Cr in the motor cortex of the patients probably results from increased NAA rather than a decrease in the more stable Cr. The possible relevance of a raised NAA/Cr ratio is discussed, particularly with regard to the changed corticospinal physiology and the functional recovery seen in the patients.","glutamine"

The present study shows that glutamate immunoreactive terminals are characterized by a wide synaptic cleft, asymmetric synaptic membrane densities and spherical synaptic vesicles. Most of the glutamatergic terminals are presynaptic to small or medium size dendrites. In contrast, GABAergic terminals display typical pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, a narrow synaptic cleft and a symmetrical membrane density. Qualitative analysis indicated that 13-17 months after hemisection, the length of the synaptic active zones in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals ipsilateral to hemisection is longer than those observed in the terminals contralateral to hemisection orfin normal control cats. Furthermore, the perimeters of both dendrites and either glutamate or GABA immunoreactive terminals are longer on the hemisected side compared with those observed in the nonhemisected side of the spinal cord. The results are important for complete understanding of the mechanisms which underlie locomotor recovery in mammals following spinal cord injury.","glutamine"

These observations suggest that release of excitatory amino acids contributes to secondary tissue damage after traumatic spinal cord injury. To further examine this hypothesis, concentrations of free amino acids were measured in spinal cord samples from anesthetized rats subjected to various degrees of impact trauma to the T9 spinal segment. Levels of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter amino acids [gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, aspartate, glycine, taurine] and levels of nonneurotransmitter amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, alanine, threonine, serine) were determined at 5 min, 4 h, and 24 h posttrauma. Uninjured surgical (laminectomy) control animals showed modest but significant declines in aspartate and glutamate levels, but not in other amino acids, at all time points. In injured animals, the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate were significantly decreased by 5 min posttrauma, and remained depressed at 4 h and 24 h as compared with corresponding laminectomy controls. In contrast, the inhibitory amino acids, glycine, GABA, and taurine, were decreased at 5 min postinjury, had partially recovered at 4 h, and were almost fully recovered at 24 h. The nonneurotransmitter amino acids were unchanged at 5 min posttrauma and significantly increased at 4 h, with partial recovery at 24 h. At 4 h postinjury, severe trauma caused significantly greater decreases in aspartate and glutamate than did either mild or moderate injury. These findings are consistent with the postulated role of excitatory amino acids in CNS trauma.","glutamine"

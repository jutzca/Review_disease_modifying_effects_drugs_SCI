Neuroprotective strategies have been applied aiming to prevent secondary cell death but no successful and robust effects have been observed. Recently, combinatorial approaches using biomaterials with cells and/or growth factors have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects because of the improvement of axonal growth and in vivo functional recovery in model organisms. In situ injectable hydrogels are a particularly attractive neuroregenerative approach to improve spinal cord repair and regeneration since they can be precisely injected into the lesion site filling the space prior to gelification, decrease scarring and promote axon growth due to the hydrogel's soft structure. Important advances regarding the use of hydrogels as potential therapeutic approaches has been reported during the last 10 years. Injectable alginate hydrogel loaded with GDNF, thermoresponsives heparin-poloxamer loaded with NGF and imidazole-poly(organophosphazenes) hydrogels are just three examples of biomaterials that can promote neurite, axon growth and improve functional recovery in hemisected and resected rats. Here we will review the status of in situ injectable hydrogels for spinal cord regeneration with special focus in the advantages of using hydrogel scaffolds, the ideal polymers to be used, the gelification process and the cells or growth factors combined. The in vitro and in vivo results reported for those biomaterials will be presented, compared and discussed.","heparin"

However, direct administration of GFs is limited by their rapid degradation and dilution at the injured sites. Moreover, SCI recovery is a multifactorial process that requires multiple GFs to participate in tissue regeneration. Based on these facts, controlled delivery of multiple growth factors (GFs) to lesion areas is becoming an attractive strategy for repairing SCI. Presently, we developed a GFs-based delivery system (called GFs-HP) that consisted of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and heparin-poloxamer (HP) hydrogel through self-assembly mode. This GFs-HP was a kind of thermosensitive hydrogel that was suitable for orthotopic administration in vivo. Meanwhile, a 3D porous structure of this hydrogel is commonly used to load large amounts of GFs. After single injection of GFs-HP into the lesioned spinal cord, the sustained release of NGF and bFGF from HP could significantly improve neuronal survival, axon regeneration, reactive astrogliosis suppression and locomotor recovery, when compared with the treatment of free GFs or HP. Moreover, we also revealed that these neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of GFs-HP were likely through activating the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signalling pathways. Overall, our work will provide an effective therapeutic strategy for SCI repair.","heparin"

The controlled release of FGF4, a novel neuroprotective factor, from a versatile Laponite hydrogel to the injured site was a promising strategy to promote axon regeneration and motor functional recovery after SCI. Methods: Characterization of Laponite, Laponite/Heparin (Lap/Hep) and Laponite/Heparin loaded with FGF4 (Lap/Hep@FGF4) hydrogels were measured by rheometer. Multiple comprehensive evaluations were used to detect motor functional recovery and the axonal rehabilitation after Lap/Hep@FGF4 treatment in vivo (SCI rat model). Moreover, microtubule dynamic and energy transportation, which regulated axonal regeneration was evaluated by Lap/Hep@FGF4 gel in vitro (primary neuron). Results: FGF4 released from Lap/Hep gel locally achieves strong protection and regeneration after SCI. The Lap/Hep@FGF4 group revealed remarkable motor functional recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI through suppressing inflammatory reaction, increasing remyelination and reducing glial/fibrotic scars. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of axonal rehabilitation were demonstrated via enhancing microtubule stability and regulating mitochondrial localization after Lap/Hep@FGF4 treatment.

CSPG-mediated inhibition is mainly associated with the glycosaminoglycan chains of CSPGs, and chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) is the predominant sulfated structure that regulates axonal guidance and growth in the adult nervous system. With the aim to find molecules that neutralize the inhibitory functions of C4S, we screened a phage display library for peptides binding to C4S. From the phage clones binding to C4S we selected three peptides for further analysis. We observed that these peptides bind to C4S, but not chondroitin-6-sulfate, heparin sulfate or dermatan sulfate, in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, whereas the scrambled peptides showed highly reduced or no binding to C4S. The C4S-binding peptides, but not their scrambled counterparts, when added to cultures of mouse cerebellar neurons and human neuroblastoma cells, neutralized the inhibitory functions of the C4S- and CSPG-coated substrate on cell adhesion, neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that the C4S-binding peptides neutralize several inhibitory functions of CSPGs, suggesting that they may be beneficial in repairing mammalian nervous system injuries.","heparin"

Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics (LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand-receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide (1-42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures and shown to inhibit myelination. Thus, we propose that LS-mHeps exert multiple beneficial effects on mechanisms supporting enhanced repair, and represent novel candidates as therapeutics for CNS damage.","heparin"

In this study, we aim to develop a clinically feasible way for targeted delivery of multiple drugs with different physiochemical properties to the SCI site, detail the underlying mechanism of neural recovery, and detect any synergistic effect related to combination therapy. Methods: Liposomes (LIP) modified with a scar-targeted tetrapeptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) were first constructed to simultaneously encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and then were further added into a thermosensitive heparin-modified poloxamer hydrogel (HP) with affinity-bound acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF-HP) for local administration into the SCI site (CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP) in a rat model. In vivo fluorescence imaging was used to examine the specificity of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX binding to the injured site. Multiple comprehensive evaluations including biotin dextran amine anterograde tracing and magnetic resonance imaging were used to detect any synergistic effects and the underlying mechanisms of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP both in vivo (rat SCI model) and in vitro (primary neuron). Results: The multiple drugs were effectively delivered to the injured site. The combined application of GFs and DTX supported neuro-regeneration by improving neuronal survival and plasticity, rendering a more permissive extracellular matrix environment with improved regeneration potential. In addition, our combination therapy promoted axonal regeneration via moderation of microtubule function and mitochondrial transport along the regenerating axon.

These patients with polytrauma pose unique challenges to clinicians. The current review evaluates existing guidelines and updates the evidence for prehospital transport, immobilization, initial resuscitation, critical care, hemodynamic stability, diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, and timing appropriate for the patient with SCI who has multisystem trauma. Initial management should be systematic, with focus on spinal immobilization, timely transport, and optimizing perfusion to the spinal cord. There is general evidence for the maintenance of mean arterial pressure of > 85 mm Hg during immediate and acute care to optimize neurological outcome; however, the selection of vasopressor type and duration should be judicious, with considerations for level of injury and risks of increased cardiogenic complications in the elderly. Level II recommendations exist for early decompression, and additional time points of neurological assessment within the first 24 hours and during acute care are warranted to determine the temporality of benefits attributable to early surgery. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended by current guidelines for SCI. For these patients, titration of tidal volumes is important to balance the association of earlier weaning off the ventilator, with its risk of atelectasis, against the risk for lung damage from mechanical overinflation that can occur with prolonged ventilation. Careful evaluation of infection risk is a priority following multisystem trauma for patients with relative immunosuppression or compromise. Although patients with polytrauma may experience longer rehabilitation courses, long-term neurological recovery is generally comparable to that in patients with isolated SCI after controlling for demographics. Bowel and bladder disorders are common following SCI, significantly reduce quality of life, and constitute a focus of targeted therapies. Emerging biomarkers including glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100β, and microRNAs for traumatic SCIs are presented.

Most approaches have been focused on providing supportive substrates for guiding neurons and overcoming the physical and chemical barriers to healing that arise after SCI. Although collagen has become a promising natural substrate with good compatibility, its low mechanical properties restrict its potential applications. The mechanical properties mainly rely on the composition and pore structure of scaffolds. For the composition of a scaffold, we used heparin sulfate to react with collagen by crosslinking. For the structure, we adopted a three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to fabricate a scaffold with a uniform pore distributions. We observed that the internal structure of the scaffold printed with a 3D bioprinter was regular and porous. We also found that both the compression modulus and strengths of the scaffold were significantly enhanced by the collagen/heparin sulfate composition compared to a collagen scaffold.

Computed tomography of the spine is superior to plain films, as the former rarely misses fractures, though caution needs to be exerted as occipitocervical dislocation can still be missed. To reliably assess the spinal neural elements, soft tissues, and ligamentous structures, magnetic resonance imaging is indicated and should be obtained within 48-72 h from the time of injury. All patients should be graded daily using the American Spinal Injury Association classification, with the first prognostic score at 72 h postinjury. Patients with high cervical cord (C4 or higher) injury should be intubated immediately, and those with lower cord injuries should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, in the acute setting, respiratory mechanics will be disrupted with any spinal cord lesion above T11. Steroids have become extremely controversial, and the professional societies for neurosurgery in the United States have given a level 1 statement against their use in all patients. We, therefore, do not advocate for them at this time. With every SCI, a spine surgeon must be consulted to discuss operative vs nonoperative management strategies. Indications for surgery include a partial or progressive neurologic deficit, instability of the spine not allowing for mobilization, correction of a deformity, and prevention of potential neurologic compromise. Measures to prevent pulmonary emboli from deep venous thromboembolisms are necessary: IVC filters are recommended in bedbound patients and low-molecular weight heparins are superior to unfractionated heparin. Robust prevention of pressure ulcers as well as nutritional support should be a mainstay of treatment. Lastly, it is important to note that neurologic recovery is a several-year process. The most recovery occurs in the first year following injury, and therefore aggressive rehabilitation is crucial.","heparin"

At each injury severity, intravenous heparin or saline was administered for 72 hours following SCI. Behavioral tests (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores, Hargreave's) were performed before killing the rats at week 7. Half of the rats were killed at day 3, and the remainder at week 7 after SCI. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and axonal retrograde tracing were conducted at both times. Subpial hemorrhage was greater in heparin-treated animals compared with controls at all severities of SCI day 3 after injury. Counterintuitively, intraparencyhmal hemorrhage was minimal in the lesion epicenter following mild SCI in the heparin-treated animals compared with controls. India ink perfusion revealed greater preservation of microcirculation in heparin-treated animals compared with a reduction in control animals. A decrease in spinal cord perfusion correlated directly with an increase in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression. There was significant gray matter sparing, but no change in white matter volume after heparin treatment at week 7 in the mild SCI group. Beneficial effects on hemorrhagic volume, axon sparing, and functional recovery following heparin treatment were not observed in the moderate or severe SCI group.

In this review, the authors summarize the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system as well as the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of major cardiovascular complications that can occur following acute (up to 30 days) traumatic SCI. Hypotension (both supine and orthostatic), autonomic dysreflexia, and cardiac arrhythmias (including persistent bradycardia) are attributed to the loss of supraspinal control of the sympathetic nervous system that commonly occurs in patients with severe spinal cord lesions at T-6 or higher. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend: 1) monitoring of cardiac and hemodynamic parameters in the acute phase of SCI; 2) maintenance of a minimum mean arterial blood pressure of 85 mm Hg during the hyperacute phase (1 week after SCI); 3) timely detection and appropriate treatment of neurogenic shock and cardiac arrhythmias; and 4) immediate and adequate treatment of episodes of acute autonomic dysreflexia. In addition to these forms of cardiovascular dysfunction, individuals with acute SCIs are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to loss of mobility and, potentially, altered fibrinolytic activity, abnormal platelet function, and impaired circadian variations of hemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters. Current evidence supports a recommendation for thromboprophylaxis using mechanical methods and anticoagulants during the acute stage up to 3 months following SCI, depending on the severity and level of injury. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the first choice for anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend (or refute) the use of screening tests for DVT in asymptomatic adults with acute SCI, this strategy may detect asymptomatic DVT in at least 9.4% of individuals who undergo thromboprophylaxis using lowmolecular- weight heparin. Indications and treatment of DVT and acute pulmonary embolism are well established and are summarized in this review. Recognition of cardiovascular complications after acute SCI is essential to minimize adverse outcomes and to optimize recovery.","heparin"

A heparin-based delivery system (HBDS) was used to immobilize NT-3 within fibrin scaffolds via non-covalent interactions. The fibrin scaffolds were implanted in lesions immediately after injury in an adult rat model of SCI (complete ablation of a 2 mm segment of the cord at T9). Delivery of NT-3 was controlled by an affinity-based delivery system that limits drug loss by diffusion and releases the drug via cell-mediated processes. Twelve weeks after injury and treatment, animals treated with fibrin scaffolds and NT-3, with or without the delivery system, did not show functional improvement over saline controls. Substantial cavitation at edges of the lesion was present, and while neuronal fibers were present inside the lesion, traced corticospinal and dorsal sensory tracts did not regenerate into the lesion. Therefore, while previous studies indicate that the controlled delivery of NT-3 from fibrin scaffolds may increase the short term regenerative response, the continued degeneration of the cord, indicative of the severity of the injury, limits the long term regeneration stimulated by this treatment. Chronic or repeated treatments or a less severe injury model may prove useful in assessing the utility of controlled delivery systems for the treatment of spinal cord injury.","heparin"

This study assessed the effect of controlled delivery of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from fibrin scaffolds implanted in spinal cord lesions immediately following 2-mm ablation injury in adult rats. Nine days after injury, fibrin scaffolds containing the delivery system and NT-3 (1000 ng/mL) elicited more robust neuronal fiber growth into the lesion than did control scaffolds or saline (1.5- to 3-fold increase). Implantation of fibrin scaffolds resulted in a dramatic reduction of glial scar formation at the white matter border of the lesion. Hindlimb motor function of treated animals did not improve relative to controls at 12 weeks post-injury. Thus, controlled delivery of NT-3 from fibrin scaffolds enhanced the initial regenerative response by increasing neuronal fiber sprouting and cell migration into the lesion, while functional motor recovery was not observed in this model.","heparin"

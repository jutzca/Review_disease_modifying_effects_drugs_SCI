The choroid plexus (CP) plays a regulatory role in neural regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote neurogenesis in the ventricular-subventricular zone. However, it is unclear whether MSCs interact with the CP in brain tissue repair. Rat (r)MSCs were labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) and transduced with red fluorescent protein, and then injected into the brain of rats with ischemic stroke and monitored over time by magnetic resonance imaging. The functional recovery of rats was determined by the corner test score, Modified Neurological Severity score, and stroke volume. MSCs and CP were also co-cultured for 14 days, and the medium was analyzed with a cytokine array. In vivo imaging and histologic analysis revealed that ION-labeled MSCs were mainly located at the injection site and migrated to the infarct area and to the CP. Functional recovery was greater in rats treated with MSCs as compared to those that received mock treatment. Bidirectional enhancement of proliferation in MSCs and CP was observed in the co-culture; moreover, MSCs migrated to the CP. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated levels of proliferation- and adhesion-related cytokines and chemokines in the culture medium. Wikipathway predictions indicated that insulin-like growth factor 1/Akt signaling (WP3675), chemokine signaling pathway (WP2292), and spinal cord injury (WP2432) are involved in the increased proliferation and migration of MSCs co-cultured with the CP. Crosstalk with the CP enhances MSC proliferation and migration in a transwell assay. Moreover, MRI reveals MSC migration towards the CP in an ischemic stroke model. The secreted factors resulting from this interaction have therapeutic potential for promoting functional recovery in the brain after ischemic stroke.","insulin"

The brain was long thought to be ""insulin-independent,"" but research has shown that insulin receptors (IR) are expressed on neurons, microglia and astrocytes, among other cells. The effects of insulin on cells within the central nervous system are varied, and can include both metabolic and non-metabolic functions. Emerging data suggests that insulin can improve neuronal survival or recovery after trauma or during neurodegenerative diseases. Further, data suggests a strong anti-inflammatory component of insulin, which may also play a role in both neurotrauma and neurodegeneration. As a result, administration of exogenous insulin, either via systemic or intranasal routes, is an increasing area of focus in research in neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disorders. This review will explore the literature to date on the role of insulin in neurotrauma and neurodegeneration, with a focus on traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).","insulin"

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a protective cytokine that plays an important role in multiple diseases, whereas the distinct role in SCI-induced remains critical questions to address. Here we designed to explore the role and underlying mechanism of IGF-1 in endothelial damage after SCI. In the current study, we established mouse microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) injury model via LPS and cDNA of IGF-1 was transfected into MVECs. In vivo SCI mice, overexpression of IGF-1 (SCI-IGF-1) and its corresponding empty vehicle (SCI-NC) were conducted using lentivirus, then apoptosis degree, component of tight junction, and inflammatory damage were evaluated. IGF-1 treatment in MVECs displayed a milder apoptosis and cell damage under LPS insult. IGF-1 increased the level of PI3K/AKT pathway, which impeded the procedure of apoptosis. Blocking of PI3K/AKT pathway markedly neutralized the effect of IGF-1 treatment. Transfection of excess IGF-1 into SCI mice significantly corrected microenvironment of neural tissue repair, reduced area of injured core and improved functional recovery with greater activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. The results above argue that the promising roles played by IGF-1 is potentially vital for developing effective future therapies in SCI.","insulin"

After SCI, Western diet impaired sensorimotor and bladder recovery, increased microgliosis, exacerbated oligodendrocyte loss and reduced axon sprouting. Direct and indirect neural injury mechanisms are suggested since HFHS culture conditions drove parallel injury responses directly and indirectly after culture with conditioned media from HFHS-treated astrocytes. In each case, injury mechanisms included reductions in IGF-1R, SIRT1 and PGC-1Î± and were prevented by metformin.

We examined the effects of SCI on functional recovery, cardiac structure and function, body composition, and glucose metabolism on adult female and male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. SCI was induced at T10 via contusion. Measured outcomes include behavioral assessment, body weight, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for body composition, echocardiography for cardiac structure and function, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) for glucose metabolism, insulin tolerance test (ITT), and histology of cardiac structure at the endpoint. There was a decrease in body fat percentage in both sexes, with SCI females disproportionately affected in percent body fat change. Left ventricular internal diameter during systole (LVIDs) was decreased in SCI females more than in SCI males. No significant differences in glucose metabolism were observed up to 20 weeks post-injury (PI).

The M1 phenotype exacerbates neuroinflammation, whereas the M2 phenotype promotes tissue repair and provides anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we compared the effects of M2 and M1 microglia transplantation on SCI. First, we established a method for effective induction of M1 or M2 microglia by exposure to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin (IL)-4, respectively, to be used for transplantation in a SCI mouse model. In the M2 microglia transplantation group, significant recovery of motor function was observed compared with the control and M1 groups. Elevated transcription of several neuroprotective molecules including mannose receptor C type 1 (Mrc1), arginase 1 (Arg1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) was observed. Moreover, intramuscular injection of FluoroRubyÂ dye revealed recovery of retrograde axonal transport from the neuromuscular junction to upstream of the injured spinal cord only in the M2-transplanted group, although the number of migrated microglia were comparable in both M1 and M2 groups. In conclusion, our results indicated that M2 microglia obtained by IL-4 stimulation may be a promising candidate for cell transplantation therapy for SCI.","insulin"

Using a SCI contusion model in C57Bl/6 mice, we transplanted IGF-1 overexpressing or wild-type BMMSCs into the lesion site following SCI and evaluated cell survival, proliferation, immunomodulation, oxidative stress, myelination, and functional outcomes. BMMSC-IGF1 transplantation was associated with increased cell survival and recruitment of endogenous neural progenitor cells compared to BMMSC- or saline-treated controls. Modulation of gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators was observed after BMMSC-IGF1 and compared to saline- and BMMSC-treated mice. Treatment with BMMSC-IGF1 restored spinal cord redox homeostasis by upregulating antioxidant defense genes.

The treatment of SCI has progressed with the development of tissue engineering techniques. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are growth factors closely related to nerve regeneration. In this study, IGF-1 and BDNF were successfully immobilized on biodegradable graphene oxide (GO)-incorporated PLGA (PLGA/GO) electrospun nanofibres. The effect of PLGA/GO nanofibres with immobilized IGF-1 and BDNF on neurogenesis was investigated in vitro and in vivo utilizing MTT assays, immunofluorescence, motor function detection and histology observations. We demonstrated that PLGA/GO nanofibres loaded with IGF-1 and BDNF not only protected NSCs from oxidative stress induced by H2O2 but also enhanced NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro. The in vivo study of an SCI animal model demonstrated that local delivery of IGF-1 and BDNF immobilized to PLGA/GO nanofibres significantly improved functional locomotor recovery, reduced cavity formation and increased the number of neurons at the injury site. Our study indicated that PLGA/GO is an effective carrier for IGF-1 and BDNF delivery and that immobilization of IGF-1 and BDNF onto PLGA/GO nanofibres has a great potential as a nerve implant for spinal cord injury applications.","insulin"

Here, we use specific transgenic mouse lines and depleting agents to understand the response of microglia after SCI. We find that microglia are highly dynamic and proliferate extensively during the first two weeks, accumulating around the lesion. There, activated microglia position themselves at the interface between infiltrating leukocytes and astrocytes, which proliferate and form a scar in response to microglia-derived factors, such as IGF-1. Depletion of microglia after SCI causes disruption of glial scar formation, enhances parenchymal immune infiltrates, reduces neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival, and impairs locomotor recovery. Conversely, increased microglial proliferation, induced by local M-CSF delivery, reduces lesion size and enhances functional recovery. Altogether, our results identify microglia as a key cellular component of the scar that develops after SCI to protect neural tissue.","insulin"

We have shown that survival of NSC grafts declines after transplantation into the injured spinal cord, and that combining treadmill training (TMT) enhances NSC survival via insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Here, we aimed to obtain genetic evidence that IGF-1 signaling in the transplanted NSCs determines the beneficial effects of TMT. We transplanted NSCs heterozygous (+/-) for Igf1r, the gene encoding IGF-1 receptor, into the mouse spinal cord after injury, with or without combining TMT. We analyzed the influence of genotype and TMT on locomotor recovery and survival and migration of NSC grafts. In vitro experiments were performed to examine the potential roles of IGF-1 signaling in the migratory ability of NSCs. Mice receiving +/- NSC grafts showed impaired locomotor recovery compared with those receiving wild-type (+/+) NSCs. Locomotor improvement by TMT was more pronounced with +/+ grafts. Deficiency of one allele of Igf1r significantly reduced survival and migration of the transplanted NSCs. Although TMT did not significantly influence NSC survival, it substantially enhanced the extent of migration for only +/+ NSCs. Cultured neurospheres exhibited dynamic motility with cytoplasmic protrusions, which was regulated by IGF-1 signaling. IGF-1 signaling in transplanted NSCs may be essential in regulating their survival and migration. Furthermore, TMT may promote NSC graft-mediated locomotor recovery via activation of IGF-1 signaling in transplanted NSCs. Dynamic NSC motility via IGF-1 signaling may be the cellular basis for the TMT-induced enhancement of migration.","insulin"

We reactivated the growth capacity of mature descending propriospinal neurons with osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor before SCI14,15; induced growth-supportive substrates with fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor; and chemoattracted propriospinal axons with glial-derived neurotrophic factor16,17 delivered via spatially and temporally controlled release from biomaterial depots18,19, placed sequentially after SCI.

Stimulated, supported and chemoattracted propriospinal axons regrew a full spinal segment beyond lesion centres, passed well into spared neural tissue, formed terminal-like contacts exhibiting synaptic markers and conveyed a significant return of electrophysiological conduction capacity across lesions. Thus, overcoming the failure of axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions after maturity required the combined sequential reinstatement of several developmentally essential mechanisms that facilitate axon growth. These findings identify a mechanism-based biological repair strategy for complete SCI lesions that could be suitable to use with rehabilitation models designed to augment the functional recovery of remodelling circuits.","insulin"

Studies have consistently demonstrated that PRP concentrates are an abundant source of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and epithelial growth factor (EGF). The complex mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury (SCI) diminish intrinsic repair and neuronal regeneration. Several studies have suggested that growth factor-promoted axonal regeneration can occur for an extended period after injury. More importantly, the delivery of exogenous growth factors contained in PRP, such as EGF, IGF-1, and TGF-Î², has neurotrophic effects on central nervous system (CNS) injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. However, only a few studies have investigated the effects of PRP on CNS injuries or neurodegenerative diseases. According to our review of relevant literature, no study has investigated the effect of intrathecal (i.t.) PRP injection into the injured spinal cord and activation of intrinsic mechanisms. In the present study, we directly injected i.t. PRP into rat spinal cords and examined the effects of PRP on normal and injured spinal cords. In rats with normal spinal cords, PRP induced microglia and astrocyte activation and PDGF-B and ICAM-1 expression. In rats with SCIs, i.t. PRP enhanced the locomotor recovery and spared white matter, promoted angiogenesis and neuronal regeneration, and modulated blood vessel size. Furthermore, a sustained treatment (a bolus of PRP followed by a 1/3 dose of initial PRP concentration) exerted more favorable therapeutic effects than a single dose of PRP. Our findings suggest by i.t. PRP stimulate angiogenesis, enhancing neuronal regeneration after SCI in rats. Although PRP induces minor inflammation in normal and injured spinal cords, it has many advantages. It is an autologous, biocompatible, nontoxic material that does not result in a major immune response. In addition, based on its safety and ease of preparation, we hypothesize that PRP is a promising therapeutic agent for SCI.","insulin"

Cranially implanted wireless stimulators delivered intermittent 8âHz, 30-70âÎ¼A cathodal pulse trains to a brainstem microelectrode. Injured controls were given inactive stimulators; rats without injuries or implants were also compared. Rectal distension or squeezing of the forepaws caused an exaggerated rise in mean arterial pressure in injured, untreated rats under anesthesia on post-injury week 6, probably reflecting autonomic dysreflexia (AD). These pressor responses became normal when 7 days of unilateral PAG stimulation was started on the injury day. Older untreated injuries (weeks 18-19) showed normal pressor responses, but unexpectedly had significant resting and nociceptive bradycardia, which was reversed by 3 weeks of PAG stimulation started on weeks 7 or 12. Subsequent chronic studies examined gastric emptying (GE), as indicated by intestinal transit of gavaged dye, and serum chemistry. GE and fasting serum insulin were reduced on injury weeks 14-15, and were both normalized by â¼5 weeks of PAG stimulation begun in weeks 7-8. Increases in calcitonin gene-related peptide, a prominent visceral afferent neurotransmitter, measured near untreated injuries (first thoracic segment) in superficial dorsal laminae were reversed by acutely or chronically initiated PAG stimulation. The NRM, given 2-3 weeks of stimulation beginning 2 days after SCI, prevented abnormalities in both pressor responses and GE on post-injury week 9, consistent with its relaying of repair commands from the PAG. The descending PAG-NRM axis thus exhibits broadly restorative influences on visceral as well as sensory-motor deficits, improving chronic as well as acute signs of injury.","insulin"

The freshly isolated monocytes or M2-like MDMs primed in vitro with IL4 and IL13 were stereotaxically injected into the lateral ventricle of stroke-affected mice to trace for their migration into ischemic hemisphere or to assess their effect on post-stroke recovery using open field, corridor, and active avoidance behavioral tests. We found that CP responded to cortical stroke by upregulation of gene expression for several possible mediators of MDM trafficking and, concomitantly, MDMs increased in CP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We then confirmed that MDMs infiltrated from blood into CP and CSF after the insult using Î²-actin-GFP chimeric mice and Fgd5-CreERT2 x Lox-stop-lox-Tomato mice. When MDMs were directly administered into CSF following stroke, they homed to the ischemic hemisphere. If they had been primed in vitro prior to their administration to become M2-like macrophages, they promoted post-stroke recovery of motor and cognitive function without influencing infarct volume.

Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that intradiencephalon HA administration also reduced the expression of neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor1 (IGF-1) at the lesion site, however, had no effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Hence, our data suggested that exogenous intradiencephalon HA retarded locomotor recovery in spinal cord injured zebrafish via modulating the repair microenvironment.","insulin"

Scar removal was conducted through a single incision with a double-bladed scalpel along the stump, and scar renewal was halted by adding Î±,Î±'-dipyridyl. During the chronic injury stage, two experiments were undertaken. The first experiment was aimed at testing the therapeutic effect of INDP combined with scar removal. Sixty days after therapeutic intervention, the expression of genes encoding for TNFÎ±, IFNÎ³, IL4, TGFÎ², BDNF, IGF1, and GAP43 was evaluated at the site of injury.

Moreover; this group presented a significant increase in IL4, TGFÎ², BDNF, IGF1, and GAP43 expression, but a decrease of TNFÎ± and IFNÎ³.

This may be secondary to exercise-intensity-dependent increases in neurotrophin expression demonstrated previously in control subjects. However, rigorous examination of intensity-dependent changes in neurotrophin levels is lacking in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of locomotor exercise intensity on peripheral levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in individuals with incomplete SCI. We also explored the impact of the Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the BDNF gene on intensity-dependent changes. Serum concentrations of BDNF and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), as well as measures of cardiorespiratory dynamics, were evaluated across different levels of exercise intensity achieved during a graded-intensity, locomotor exercise paradigm in 11 individuals with incomplete SCI. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in serum BDNF at high, as compared to moderate, exercise intensities (pâ=â0.01) and 15 and 30âmin post-exercise (pâ<â0.01 for both), with comparison to changes at low intensity approaching significance (pâ=â0.05).

Significant correlations were observed between changes in BDNF and specific indicators of exercise intensity (e.g., rating of perceived exertion; Râ=â0.43; pâ=â0.02). Additionally, the data suggest that Val66Met SNP carriers may not exhibit intensity-dependent changes in serum BDNF concentration. Given the known role of BDNF in experience-dependent neuroplasticity, these preliminary results suggest that exercise intensity modulates serum BDNF concentrations and may be an important parameter of physical rehabilitation interventions after neurological injury.","insulin"

To date, although the lack of intrinsic regenerative potential is well described, a key regulatory molecular mechanism for the enhancement of both axonal regrowth and functional recovery after central nervous system injury remains elusive. While ubiquitin ligases coordinate neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity during development as well as after axonal injury, their role specifically in axonal regeneration is unknown. Following a bioinformatics network analysis combining ubiquitin ligases with previously defined axonal regenerative proteins, we found a triad composed of the ubiquitin ligases MDM4, MDM2 and the transcription factor p53 (encoded by TP53) as a putative central signalling complex restricting the regeneration program. Indeed, conditional deletion of MDM4 or pharmacological inhibition of MDM2/p53 interaction in the eye and spinal cord promote axonal regeneration and sprouting of the optic nerve after crush and of supraspinal tracts after spinal cord injury. The double conditional deletion of MDM4-p53 as well as MDM2 inhibition in p53-deficient mice blocks this regenerative phenotype, showing its dependence upon p53. Genome-wide gene expression analysis from ex vivo fluorescence-activated cell sorting in MDM4-deficient retinal ganglion cells identifies the downstream target IGF1R, whose activity and expression was found to be required for the regeneration elicited by MDM4 deletion. Importantly, we demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of the MDM2/p53-IGF1R axis enhances axonal sprouting as well as functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Thus, our results show MDM4-MDM2/p53-IGF1R as an original regulatory mechanism for CNS regeneration and offer novel targets to enhance neurological recovery.media-1vid110.1093/brain/awv125_video_abstractawv125_video_abstract.","insulin"

We hypothesized that uncontrollable nociception further influences SCI-sensitive miRNAs and associated gene targets, potentially explaining the progression of maladaptive plasticity. Our data validated previously described sensitivity of miRNAs to SCI alone. Moreover, following SCI, intermittent noxious stimulation decreased expression of miR124 in dorsal spinal cord 24 h after stimulation and increased expression of miR129-2 in dorsal, and miR1 in ventral spinal cord at 7 days. We also found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated 1 day after SCI alone, and significantly more so, after SCI followed by tailshock. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression was significantly increased at both 1 and 7 days post-SCI, and significantly more so, 7 days post-SCI with shock. MiR1 expression was positively and significantly correlated with IGF-1, but not BDNF mRNA expression. Further, stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that a significant proportion of the changes in BDNF and IGF-1 mRNA expression were explained by variance in two groups of miRNAs, implying co-regulation. Collectively, these data show that uncontrollable nociception which activates sensorimotor circuits distal to the injury site, influences SCI-miRNAs and target mRNAs within the lesion site. SCI-sensitive miRNAs may well mediate adverse consequences of uncontrolled sensorimotor activation on functional recovery. However, their sensitivity to distal sensory input also implicates these miRNAs as candidate targets for the management of SCI and neuropathic pain.","insulin"

The present study was designed to investigate potential interactions between the transplantation (TP) of neural stem cells (NSCs) obtained at embryonic day 14 and treadmill training (TMT) in promoting locomotor recovery and structural repair in rat contusive injury model. Combination of TMT with NSC TP at 1 week after injury synergistically improved locomotor function. We report here that combining TMT increased the survival of grafted NSCs by >3-fold and >5-fold at 3 and 9 weeks after injury, respectively. The number of surviving NSCs was significantly correlated with the extent of locomotor recovery. NSCs grafted into the injured spinal cord were under cellular stresses induced by reactive nitrogen or oxygen species, which were markedly attenuated by TMT. TMT increased the concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the CSF. Intrathecal infusion of neutralizing IGF-1 antibodies, but not antibodies against either BDNF or Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), abolished the enhanced survival of NSC grafts by TMT. The combination of TP and TMT also resulted in tissue sparing, increased myelination, and restoration of serotonergic fiber innervation to the lumbar spinal cord to a larger extent than that induced by either TP or TMT alone. Therefore, we have discovered unanticipated beneficial effects of TMT in modulating the survival of grafted NSCs via IGF-1.

The inhibition of Ptena expression by antisense morpholino (MO) application improved spinal cord regeneration through 4 to 5weeks after injury. Retrograde tracing showed regrowth of axons from neurons of the regeneration-competent nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle in the brainstem in the Ptena MO-treated fish. Ptenb MO-treated fish recovered as well as control MO-treated fish at 4 and 5weeks after SCI, with their locomotion being similar to that of sham-injured and non-injured fish. The mRNA levels of Ptena were upregulated after SCI at the early stage after injury (12h and 6days) caudal to the lesion site, compared to the non-injured control, while the levels of Ptenb were upregulated only at 12h after injury. In situ hybridization experiments were in agreement with the qPCR measurements. At the protein level, Ptena was found to be expressed in spinal motoneurons and immature neurons. These results indicate that Ptena, but not Ptenb, inhibits regeneration in zebrafish, thus sharing this feature with PTEN in mammals. The fact that zebrafish regenerate better than mammals despite the inhibitory presence of Ptena is likely due to regeneration-conducive molecules that tip the balance from inhibition to enhancement. Interestingly, although Ptena and Ptenb have been shown to be functionally redundant in promoting the development of the fish larval central nervous system, they are not functionally redundant in the adult, suggesting that regeneration in fish is not predominantly due to the overall recapitulation of development.","insulin"

MVP is a multifunctional protein expressed not only in many types of tumours but also in the nervous system, where its importance for regeneration is, however, unclear. Using an established zebrafish SCI model, we found that MVP mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in ependymal cells in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site at 6 and 11 days after SCI.

It is considered to be a major obstacle for central nervous system (CNS) recovery after injury, especially in light of its well-known activity in limiting axonal growth. Therefore, its degradation has become a key therapeutic goal in the field of CNS regeneration. Yet, the abundant de novo synthesis of CSPG in response to CNS injury is puzzling. This apparent dichotomy led us to hypothesize that CSPG plays a beneficial role in the repair process, which might have been previously overlooked because of nonoptimal regulation of its levels. This hypothesis is tested in the present study. We inflicted spinal cord injury in adult mice and examined the effects of CSPG on the recovery process. We used xyloside to inhibit CSPG formation at different time points after the injury and analyzed the phenotype acquired by the microglia/macrophages in the lesion site. To distinguish between the resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes, we used chimeric mice whose bone marrow-derived myeloid cells expressed GFP. We found that CSPG plays a key role during the acute recovery stage after spinal cord injury in mice. Inhibition of CSPG synthesis immediately after injury impaired functional motor recovery and increased tissue loss. Using the chimeric mice we found that the immediate inhibition of CSPG production caused a dramatic effect on the spatial organization of the infiltrating myeloid cells around the lesion site, decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production by microglia/macrophages, and increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. In contrast, delayed inhibition, allowing CSPG synthesis during the first 2 d following injury, with subsequent inhibition, improved recovery. Using in vitro studies, we showed that CSPG directly activated microglia/macrophages via the CD44 receptor and modulated neurotrophic factor secretion by these cells. Our results show that CSPG plays a pivotal role in the repair of injured spinal cord and in the recovery of motor function during the acute phase after the injury; CSPG spatially and temporally controls activity of infiltrating blood-borne monocytes and resident microglia. The distinction made in this study between the beneficial role of CSPG during the acute stage and its deleterious effect at later stages emphasizes the need to retain the endogenous potential of this molecule in repair by controlling its levels at different stages of post-injury repair.","insulin"

In these subjects BDNF concentration at rest was sixfold higher compared with the concentrations reported earlier in able-bodied persons, while IGF-1, PRL and COR were within normal range. Ten minutes of moderate intensity handbiking (54% of the maximal heart rate) during a warm-up period (W) induced an increase (P<0.05) of BDNF of approximately 1.5-fold from basal level at rest, while a decrease to basal level was found after an immediately succeeding handbiking time trial (89% of the maximal heart rate) over the marathon distance of 42 km (M). An increase (P<0.01) of serum IGF-1 was found after W and this levels remained elevated (P<0.01) until the end of M. W had no significant effects on the serum PRL and COR, however, M induced an increase (P<0.01) of both hormones. This is the first study showing elevated BDNF concentrations at rest in spinal cord-injured athletes. Furthermore, short moderate intensity handbiking but not immediately following long lasting high intensity handbiking further increases serum BDNF concentrations. IGF-1 response to exercise differs to BDNF response as this neuroplasticity-related protein remains elevated during the long lasting physical demand with high intensity. The augmented PRL concentration suggests that a possible mechanism by which exercise promotes neuroplasticity might be the activation of neural serotonergic pathways as 5-HT is the main PRL releasing factor. Elevated COR concentrations after M are unlikely to be deleterious to neuroplasticity as COR concentrations remain within the physiological range. The present study suggests that exercise might be beneficial to enhance neuroprotection and neuroplasticity, thereby improving recovery after spinal cord injury.","insulin"

This investigation was undertaken to find out whether a combination of select neurotrophins (BDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor [GDNF], neurotrophin 3 [NT-3], or nerve growth factor [NGF]) will further enhance the neuroprotective efficacy of growth factors in SCI. The neurotrophins (0.1-1 microg/10 microL in phosphate-buffered saline) were applied 30, 60, or 90 min after injury topically over the traumatized spinal cord either alone or in combination. The SCI was performed by making a unilateral incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-T11 segment under Equithesin anesthesia. The rats were allowed to survive 5 h after trauma. Topical application of BDNF, GDNF, or NGF 30 min after SCI in high concentration (0.5 microg and 1 microg) significantly improved the motor functions and reduced the BSCB breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury seen at 5 h. These beneficial effects of neurotropins were absent when administered separately either 60 or 90 min after SCI. However, a combination of BDNF and GDNF (but not with NT-3 or NGF) given either 60 or 90 min after SCI significantly reduced the motor dysfunction and spinal cord pathology at 5 h. These novel observations suggest that a select group of neurotrophins in combination have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of SCI in clinical situations.","insulin"

This study was undertaken to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of insulin in the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI) and evaluate its therapeutic effects in adult rats. SCI was produced by extradural compression using modified Allen's stall with damage energy of 40 g-cm force. One group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of recombinant human insulin dissolved in 50% glucose solution at the dose of 1 IU/kg day, for 7 days. At the same time, another group of rats was subjected to SCI in combination with the administration of an equal volume of sterile saline solution. Functional recovery was evaluated using open-field walking, inclined plane tests, and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during the first 14 days post-trauma. Levels of protein for B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (Bcl-2), Caspase-3, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were quantified in the injured spinal cord by Western blot analysis. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Ultimately, the data established the effectiveness of insulin treatment in improving neurologic recovery, increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 proteins, inhibiting caspase-3 expression decreasing neuronal apoptosis, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines iNOS and COX-2, and ameliorating microcirculation of injured spinal cord after moderate contusive SCI in rats. In sum, this study reported the beneficial effects of insulin in the treatment of SCI, with the suggestion that insulin should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent.","insulin"

Its neuroprotective roles may be coordinated by activation of Akt, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and thus inhibition of tau phosphorylation. The authors investigated the role and mechanism of IGF-I gene transfer after spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies were performed in 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats after spinal cord hemisection. The authors conducted hydrodynamics-based gene transfection in which an IGF-I plasmid was rapidly injected into the rat's tail vein 30 minutes after SCI. The animals were randomly divided into four groups: Group I, sham operated; Group II, SCI treated with pCMV-IGF-I gene; Group III, SCI treated with vehicle pCMV-LacZ gene; and Group IV, SCI only. The results showed that IGF-I gene transfer promoted motor recovery, antiinflammatory responses, and antiapoptotic effects after SCI. Using techniques of Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, the authors assessed the mechanism of IGF-I gene transfer after SCI in terms of activation of Akt, inhibition of GSK-3beta, attenuation of p35, and inhibition of tau phosphorylation. Moreover, they found that IGF-I gene transfer could block caspase-9 cleavage, increase Bcl-2 formation, and thus inhibit apoptosis after SCI. The intravenous administration of IGF-I after SCI activated Akt, attenuated GSK-3beta, inhibited p35 activation, diminished tau hyperphosphorylation, ended microglia and astrocyte activation, inhibited neuron loss, and significantly improved neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, IGF-I attenuated caspase-9 cleavage, increased Bcl2, and thus inhibited apoptosis after SCI.","insulin"

Despite the fact that patients with depression are often prescribed both, the effects of the exercise and fluoxetine antidepressant treatment used in combination are unknown. Using C57Bl/10 female mice, BDNF protein, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) protein and neurogenesis were measured in the hippocampus after 21 days of wheel running, 21 days of fluoxetine antidepressant therapy (daily i.p. injections of 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg) and the combination of the two. BDNF protein and cytogenesis/neurogenesis increased in the hippocampus with fluoxetine (high dose), but not wheel running. Hippocampal IGF-1 protein did not change with either treatment. There were no synergistic effects of combining exercise and fluoxetine treatment. Recent reports have also shown that exercise induces molecular mechanisms that benefit the spinal cord and can improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI); therefore, we repeated the assays in the spinal cord. Results showed that BDNF, IGF-1 and neurogenesis behave independently in the hippocampus and spinal cord. BDNF protein did not change in the spinal cord with either wheel running or fluoxetine treatment. Spinal cord IGF-1 protein did not change with wheel running, but it decreased with fluoxetine (high dose). Furthermore, spinal cord cytogenesis decreased with fluoxetine treatment. The combined wheel running and fluoxetine groups did not show synergistic results. Thus, the hippocampus and the spinal cord respond in distinct ways to wheel running and fluoxetine, and a prior induction of BDNF, IGF-1 or cytogenesis is unlikely to be the mechanism for wheel running providing a margin of protection against SCI.","insulin"

Generally it is thought that spinal neural networks of motor- and interneurons located in the ventral and intermediate laminae within the lumbar intumescence of the spinal cord, also referred to as central pattern generators (CPGs), are the 'producers of locomotion' and play a pivotal role in the amelioration of locomotor deficits after SCI. It has been suggested that locomotor training provides locomotor-specific sensory feedback into the CPGs, which stimulates remodeling of central nervous system pathways, including motor systems. Several molecules have been proposed to potentiate this process but the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. To understand these mechanisms, we studied the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I in functional recovery from SCI under normal and enriched environment (EE) housing conditions. In a first experiment, we discovered that subcutaneous administration of IGF-I resulted in better locomotor recovery following SCI. In a second experiment, detailed analysis of the observed functional recovery induced by EE revealed full recovery of hindlimb coordination and stability of gait. This EE-dependent functional recovery was attenuated by alterations in the pre-synaptic bouton density within the ventral gray matter of the lumbar intumescence or CPG area. Neutralization of circulating IGF-I significantly blocked the effectiveness of EE housing on functional recovery and diminished the EE-induced alterations in pre-synaptic bouton density within the CPG area. These results support the use of IGF-I as a possible therapeutic aid in early rehabilitation after SCI.","insulin"

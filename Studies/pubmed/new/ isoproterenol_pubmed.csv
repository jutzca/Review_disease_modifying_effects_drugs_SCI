Increased work of breathing, mechanical disadvantage, neuromuscular disease, impaired nutritional status, shock, hypoxemia, acidosis, and deficiency of potassium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphorus are the major non-neurologic factors which contribute to respiratory muscle fatigue and failure. Respiratory muscle fatigue has two components. High frequency fatigue occurs rapidly with intense contractile efforts but is usually not severe. It also recovers rapidly with rest. Low frequency fatigue develops more slowly but is severe and requires hours for recovery. Since the spontaneous rate of neural stimulation is predominantly in the low frequency range, this component of fatigue is of particular clinical importance. Fatigue of the inspiratory muscles leads to acute respiratory acidosis, but before carbon dioxide retention occurs, it can be recognized from characteristic symptoms and signs. These include dyspnea which responds to mechanical ventilation, rapid shallow breathing, and asynchronous movements of the chest and abdomen. Inspiratory muscle fatigue must be treated by putting these muscles to rest, by mechanically supporting ventilation. In addition, underlying metabolic nutritional and circulatory abnormalities must be corrected and infection treated. Aminophylline and isoproterenol can restore inspiratory muscle contractility, but controlled clinical trials remain to be done regarding their application in acute and chronic respiratory failure. Inspiratory muscle training improves strength and endurance in patients with obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord injury, but does not always improve physical exercise performance. Again, more work is needed to develop the indications for inspiratory muscle training and to determine the optimum type and duration of the training regimen.","isoproterenol"

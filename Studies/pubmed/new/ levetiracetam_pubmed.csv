Aim of the Study: This study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of methylprednisolone and levetiracetam on SCI. Materials and Methods: In this study, 42 male Wistar Albino rats, each weighing 300-350 g, were separated into three main groups: control group, acute and subacute stage groups. With the exception of the control group, a T7-8 dorsal laminectomy was performed on the spinal column of the rats. A temporary vascular aneurysm clip was then applied to the spinal cord for 1 min to create SCI and methylprednisolone or levetiracetam was administered intraperitoneally to all except the control and SHAM control groups. The damaged spinal cord was removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. Results: Both pharmacological agents were determined to have improved the histopathological architecture in damaged neural tissues during the acute period of SCI, but could not sustain this activity in the subacute period. Neither pharmacological agent affected the biochemical data in the acute nor subacute stages. Conclusions: Both pharmacological agents showed histopathological healing effects in injured tissues during the acute phase of SCI in this rat model but these effects could not be sustained in the subacute period. No effect on biochemical data was seen in either the acute or subacute period. There is a need for further advanced studies to determine the effects of levetiracetam on the healing processes in SCI.","levetiracetam"

As no useful treatment for post-SCI complications has been approved thus far, finding novel treatments is of great importance. Considering the promising effects of melatonin (MEL) against destructive mechanisms in other models of brain damage, in the current study we evaluated its ameliorative effects on sensory-motor outcomes, inflammatory mediators, histological changes and other post-SCI complications. Rats, in SCI and MEL groups, underwent laminectomy followed by a severe compression injury by an aneurysm clip. Then, intrathecal treatment with vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or MEL was carried out post-injury. Acetone drop, von Frey, inclined plane, and BBB tests as well as weight changes and auricle temperature, were used to evaluate the neuropathic pain, motor function, and other post-SCI complications. The effects of MEL on the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed using gelatin zymography method every week till day 28 post-SCI. Histopathological assessments were performed on days 14, 21, and 28. MEL treatment resulted in decreased motor dysfunction, mechanical and cold allodynia, auricle temperature, and also ameliorated weight loss. Moreover, MEL suppressed MMP-9 activity while increasing that of MMP-2 post-SCI indicating its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Also, MEL significantly preserved white matter myelinated areas and the number of sensory neurons post-SCI. The results suggest MEL as a promising candidate for medical therapies with advantageous effects on improving functional recovery through suppressing inflammatory mediators, and attenuating spinal tissue damages.","melatonin"

However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of MT on SCI have not been elucidated. An experiment was performed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of MT on the neuronal autophagy after SCI and its effect on the recovery of nerve function. The rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: the SCI+MT+EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor), SCI+MT, SCI, and sham operation groups. On the 14th day after SCI, MT significantly promoted the recovery of motor function in the hind limbs according to the results of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores. At the same time, MT treatment resulted in reduced activation of cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive neurons and increased the survival of motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord on the 14th day after SCI, which exerted its neuroprotection. Furthermore, western blot and immunofluorescence double staining were performed to verify the molecular mechanism of effect of MT on SCI, and results showed the significantly upregulated expressions of Beclin-1, light chain-3B, SIRT1, p-AMPK proteins in the spinal cord tissue of MT-treated rats on the 14th day after SCI, however, the effect of MT on autophagy was reversed by EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor), which implied that MT activated autophagy via SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway after SCI. Similarly, the neuroprotective effects of MT on SCI were also inhibited after the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway was suppressed by EX527. Taken together, these results suggest that MT inhibits the apoptosis and activates autophagy of nerve cells after SCI and ultimately exerts the neuroprotective effect by SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway.","melatonin"

Melatonin (MT), a hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, is associated with neuroprotective effects against SCI. Enhanced autophagy can promote the recovery of locomotor function and reduce apoptosis after SCI. Interestingly, MT increases autophagy in SCI in vivo. Nevertheless, the ability of MT to increase autophagy and decrease apoptosis, and the potential effects on the recovery of motor neurons in the anterior horn after SCI remain to be clarified. In this study, we discovered that MT treatment improved motor function recovery in a rat SCI model. Indeed, MT upregulated the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), while expression of protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was downregulated after SCI. Additionally, MT increased the expression of autophagy-activating proteins, while the expression of apoptosis-activating proteins in neurons was decreased following SCI. Furthermore, autophagy was inhibited, while apoptosis was induced in SCI model rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary neurons by treatment with MT, the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa). Collectively, our results suggest that MT can improve the recovery of locomotor function by enhancing autophagy as well as reducing apoptosis after SCI in rats, probably via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.","melatonin"

Neuroinflammation exaggerates the secondary injury subsequent to trauma. Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin may help protect neural tissue against secondary injury after SCI, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Microglial/macrophages polarization plays an important role in regulating immune responses. To examine whether melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects after acute SCI by regulating microglial/macrophages polarization in the spinal cord, we administered intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (50 mg/kg) in female rats immediately after SCI and then daily for seven consecutive days (n = 6). Compared with the vehicle-treated group (n = 6), the melatonin-treated group exhibited a greater Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating score, smaller spinal cavity, and less cleaved caspase 3 immunofluorescence staining in the injured spinal segments. Real-time PCR data revealed decreases in the expression levels of M1 microglia phenotypic markers and increases in M2 markers in the spinal cord of melatonin-treated SCI rats, as compared to levels in the vehicle-treated group. Melatonin increased the number of CD206+ and Arg1+ cells, decreased the number of CD16+ and iNOS+ cells and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in the spinal cord tissue of female SCI rats. Current findings suggest that melatonin may inhibit pro-inflammatory responses and promote M2 polarization of microglial/macrophages in the spinal cord in the early stage of SCI, facilitating functional recovery. Accordingly, melatonin may represent a promising therapeutic candidate for acute SCI.","melatonin"

The neuroprotective effects of melatonin in SCI models have been reported; however, it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of melatonin are associated with alleviation of gut dysbiosis. In this study, we showed that daily intraperitoneal injection with melatonin following spinal cord contusion at thoracic level 10 in mice improved intestinal barrier integrity and GI motility, reduced expression levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, improved animal weight gain and metabolic profiling, and promoted locomotor recovery. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed that melatonin treatment decreased the Shannon index and reshaped the composition of intestinal microbiota. Melatonin-treated SCI animals showed decreased relative abundance of Clostridiales and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillales and Lactobacillus, which correlated with alteration of cytokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) expression and GI barrier permeability, as well as with locomotor recovery. Experimental induction of gut dysbiosis in mice before SCI (i.e., by oral delivery of broad-spectrum antibiotics) exacerbates neurological impairment after SCI, and melatonin treatment improves locomotor performance and intestinal integrity in antibiotic-treated SCI mice. The results suggest that melatonin treatment restores SCI-induced alteration in gut microbiota composition, which may underlie the ameliorated GI function and behavioral manifestations.","melatonin"

Rats were divided into three groups randomly: the SCI + L/D (12/12-h light/dark), SCI + LL (24-h constant light), and SCI + DD (24-h constant dark) groups. Controlled light/dark cycle was pre-applied 2 weeks before induction of spinal cord injury. There was a significant increase in motor recovery as well as body weight from postoperative day (POD) 7 under constant darkness. However, spontaneous elevation of endogenous melatonin in cerebrospinal fluid was seen at POD 3 in all of the SCI rats, which was enhanced in SCI + DD group. Augmented melatonin concentration under constant dark condition resulted in facilitation of neuronal differentiation as well as inhibition of primary cell death. In the rostrocaudal region, elevated endogenous melatonin concentration promoted neural remodeling in acute phase including oligodendrogenesis, excitatory synaptic formation, and axonal outgrowth. The changes were mediated via NAS-TrkB-AKT/ERK signal transduction co-regulated by the circadian clock mechanism, leading to rapid motor recovery. In contrast, exposure to constant light exacerbated the inflammatory responses and neuroglial loss. These results suggest that light/dark control in the acute phase might be a considerable environmental factor for a favorable prognosis after SCI.","melatonin"

Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scaling was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MT on post-SCI locomotion recovery. In addition, the measurement of spinal cord water content was performed together with Nissl staining to evaluate the protective effect of MT against SCI.

BBB scores of SCI + MT rats were increased compared with the BBB scores of SCI rats, thus confirming the beneficial role of MT treatment in post-SCI functional recovery. Meanwhile, the administration of MT could alleviate SCI by reducing spinal cord water content and by exerting a neuroprotective effect on motor neurons. Furthermore, in the treatment of SCI, MT also attenuated cell apoptosis. Moreover, the relative expression of NLRP3, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and caspase-1 were markedly elevated in the SCI group compared with that in the sham group, while the administration of MT reduced the expression of NLRP3 in SCI rats.

Moreover, scar formation is an important barrier to axonal regeneration through the lesion area. Melatonin plays an important role in reducing inflammation, but its effects on scar formation in the injured spinal cord remain unknown. Hence, we used the model of severe crush injury in mice to investigate the effects of melatonin on scar formation. Mice were randomly separated into four groups; SCI, SCI+Melatonin 1 (single dose), SCI+Melatonin 14 (14 daily doses), and control. Melatonin was administered by intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg) after injury. Immunohistochemical analysis, Western blot, and behavioral evaluation were used to explore the effects of melatonin after SCI for 14 days. The melatonin-treated mice presented higher expression of neuronal markers (P < 0.001). Remarkably, the inflammatory response appeared to be greatly reduced in the SCI+Melatonin 14 group (P < 0.001), which also displayed less scar formation (P < 0.05).

Mimicking the pathological conditions of SCI, melatonin-treated primary pericytes were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Secretion of Ang1 was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of ICAM-1 was detected by immunofluorescence. Melatonin treatment improved locomotor functional outcome and rescued motor neurons. Pericyte coverage was significantly reduced after SCI; melatonin treatment alleviated the loss of pericyte coverage and rescued perfused microvessels 7 days after injury. The permeability of BSCB and loss of occludin were attenuated, and edema formation and upregulation of AQP4 were inhibited, after melatonin treatment. The expression of Ang1 and Bcl-2 was improved, while the expression of ICAM-1 and Bax was inhibited, in melatonin-treated SCI mice. Furthermore, the secretion of Ang1 was increased and the expression of ICAM-1 was inhibited in melatonin-treated pericytes after OGD/R. Melatonin ameliorated the loss of blood vessels and disruption of BSCB to exert a protective effect on SCI, which might be mediated by increased pericyte coverage.

The expressions and activities of MMP-9 were increased at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI in the control group. In the melatonin-treated group, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI compared with the control group, and the activity of MMP-9 was significantly reduced at 72 h after SCI. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the MMP-2 level in both groups during the experimental period. Melatonin treatment following photochemically induced SCI in rats significantly ameliorated the functional deficits. On histopathologic examination, the lesion size in the spinal cord after photothrombotic insult was significantly reduced by melatonin administration. This study showed that the up-regulation of MMP-9 correlated with the secondary damage after SCI in rats. The results of this study suggest that the ability of melatonin to reduce secondary tissue damage is intimately related to the reduction of MMP-9 expression, resulting in functional improvement.","melatonin"

Melatonin was administered twice a day and exercise was performed on a treadmill for 15 min, six days per week for 3 weeks after SCI. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis were used to determine cell population for late response, in conjunction with histological examination and motor function test. There was marked improvement in hindlimb function in SCI+MT+Ex group at day 14 and 21 after injury, as documented by the reduced size of the spinal lesion and a higher density of dendritic spines and axons; such functional improvements were associated with increased numbers of BrdU-positive cells. Furthermore, MAP2 was increased in the injured thoracic segment, while GFAP was increased in the cervical segment, along with elevated numbers of BrdU-positive nestin-expressing eNSPCs in the SCI+MT+Ex group. The dendritic spine density was augmented markedly in SCI+MT and SCI+MT+Ex groups.These results suggest a synergistic effect of SCI+MT+Ex might create a microenvironment to facilitate proliferation of eNSPCs to effectively replace injured cells and to improve regeneration in SCI.","melatonin"

Each group was divided into two subgroups, each receiving an injection of vehicle or melatonin (2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 5 min prior to and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after injury. Functional recovery was monitored weekly by the open-field test, the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor scale and the inclined plane test. Histological changes of the spinal cord were examined 35 days after injury. Motor scores were progressively lower as spacer size increased according to the motor scale and inclined plane test evaluation at all times of assessment. The results of the two tests were correlated. The open-field test presented similar results with a less pronounced difference between the 35 and 50% compression groups. The injured groups presented functional recovery that was more evident in the first and second weeks. Animals receiving melatonin treatment presented more pronounced functional recovery than vehicle-treated animals as measured by the motor scale or inclined plane. NADPH-d histochemistry revealed integrity of the spinal cord thoracic segment in sham-operated animals and confirmed the severity of the lesion after spinal cord narrowing. The results obtained after experimental compression of the spinal cord support the hypothesis that melatonin may be considered for use in clinical practice because of its protective effect on the secondary wave of neuronal death following the primary wave after spinal cord injury.","melatonin"

The melatonin treatment resulted in increased hind-limb motor function and decreased iNOS mRNA expression in the L/D condition compared with the LL condition (P < 0.05), indicating that endogenous melatonin had neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, the MAFbx, MuRF1 mRNA level, and converted LC3 II protein expression were decreased in the melatonin-treated SCI groups under the LL (P < 0.05), possibly in response to the exogenous melatonin treatment. Therefore, it seems that both endogenous and exogenous melatonin contribute to neural recovery and to the prevention of skeletal muscle atrophy, promoting functional recovery after SCI.

Subsequent to SCI in humans, many individuals have residual motor and sensory deficits that impair functional performance and quality of life. The available treatments for SCI are rehabilitation therapy, activity-based therapies, and pharmacological treatment using antioxidants and their agonists. Among pharmacological treatments, the most efficient and commonly used antioxidant for experimental SCI treatment is melatonin, an indolamine secreted by pineal gland at night. Melatonin's receptor-independent free radical scavenging action and its broad-spectrum antioxidant activity makes it an ideal antioxidant to protect tissue from oxidative stress-induced secondary damage after SCI. Owing to the limitations of an activity-based therapy and antioxidant treatment singly on the functional recovery and oxidative stress-induced secondary damages after SCI, a melatonin plus exercise treatment may be a more effective therapy for SCI. As suggested herein, supplementation with melatonin in conjunction with exercise not only would improve the functional recovery by enhancing the beneficial effects of exercise but would reduce the secondary tissue damage simultaneously. Finally, melatonin may protect against exercise-induced fatigue and impairments. In this review, based on the documented evidence regarding the beneficial effects of melatonin, activity-based therapy and the combination of both on functional recovery, as well as reduction of secondary damage caused by oxidative stress after SCI, we suggest the melatonin combined with exercise would be a novel neurorehabilitative strategy for the faster recovery after SCI.","melatonin"

MAPK family includes three major members: extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), representing three different signaling cascades. Moreover, various studies have clearly shown that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is implicated as a putative danger signal involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory conditions including autoimmunity, cancer, trauma and hemorrhagic shock, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recently, we have reported that the pineal secretory product melatonin exerts important anti-inflammatory effects in an experimental model of SCI induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura after a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy. However, no reports are available on the effect of melatonin on MAPK signaling pathways and HMGB1 expression in SCI. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the melatonin protective effect observed in SCI is related to the regulation of MAPK signaling pathways and HMGB1 in mice. In this study we demonstrate the efficacy of treatment with the melatonin in SCI in mice in reducing (a) motor recovery, (b) activation of MAPKs p38, JNK and ERK1/2, (c) tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression, and (d) expression of HMGB1.

The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","melatonin"

Fasudil and menthol may be potent neuroprotective agents, which act by inhibiting a rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and suppressing the inflammatory response, respectively. We hypothesized that combined treatment of fasudil and menthol could improve functional recovery by decreasing inflammation, apoptosis, and glial scar formation. We tested our hypothesis by administering fasudil and menthol intraperitoneally (i.p.) to female Sprague Dawley rats after moderate static compression (35 g of impounder for 5 min) of T10 spinal cord. The rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups: (i) sham animals received laminectomy alone, (ii) injured (SCI) and untreated (saline 0.2 mL/day, i.p.) rats, (iii) injured (SCI) rats treated with fasudil (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for two weeks, (iv) injured (SCI) rats treated with menthol (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for twoweeks, (v) injured (SCI) rats treated with fasudil (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and menthol (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for two weeks. Compared to single treatment groups, combined treatment of fasudil and menthol demonstrated significant functional recovery and pain amelioration, which, thereby, significantly reduced inflammation, apoptosis, and glial/fibrotic scar formation. Therefore, combined treatment of fasudil and menthol may provide effective amelioration of spinal cord dysfunction by a synergistic effect of fasudil and menthol.","menthol"

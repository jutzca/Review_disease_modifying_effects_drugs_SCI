SCI is a serious traumatic disease of the central nervous system. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays important roles in SCI. Metformin has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. Whether metformin could improve SCI through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway remains unclear. Rats were divided into sham group, SCI group, SCI + metformin group, metformin + XAV939 group (XAV939 is an effective inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway), and methylprednisolone group. BBB scores were used to detect motor function recovery at different time points (0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) in SCI rats. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, TUNEL, HE and Nissl staining were used to observe the morphological characteristics of spinal cord tissue and the expression of inflammation and apoptosis in spinal cord neurons. Metformin(50 mg/kg) promoted motor functional recovery in rats after SCI, increased the expressions of β-catenin and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inhibited neuron apoptosis and inflammatory response, and improved the recovery of pathological morphology at the injury site by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We found a possible mechanism that metformin could reduce inflammation and apoptosis, and promote functional recovery of SCI rats through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.","metformin"

Here we demonstrate that the spinal cord of mice consuming HFHS expresses reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor and shows impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle function, reductions in PLP and increases in astrogliosis, all prior to SCI. After SCI, Western diet impaired sensorimotor and bladder recovery, increased microgliosis, exacerbated oligodendrocyte loss and reduced axon sprouting. Direct and indirect neural injury mechanisms are suggested since HFHS culture conditions drove parallel injury responses directly and indirectly after culture with conditioned media from HFHS-treated astrocytes. In each case, injury mechanisms included reductions in IGF-1R, SIRT1 and PGC-1α and were prevented by metformin. Results highlight the potential for a Western diet to evoke signs of neural insulin resistance and injury and metformin as a strategy to improve mechanisms of neural neuroprotection and repair.","metformin"

Thus, seeking for valid drugs that are beneficial to promoting axonal regrowth and elongation after SCI has gained wide attention. Metformin, a glucose-lowering agent, has been demonstrated to play roles in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the potential protective effect of metformin on nerve regeneration after SCI is still unclear. In this study, we found that the administration of metformin improved functional recovery after SCI through reducing neuronal cell apoptosis and repairing neurites by stabilizing microtubules via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002 partly reversed the therapeutic effects of metformin on SCI in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, metformin treatment weakened the excessive activation of oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 partially abolished its antioxidant effect. We also found that the Nrf2 transcription was partially reduced by LY294002 in vitro. Taken together, these results revealed that the role of metformin in nerve regeneration after SCI was probably related to stabilization of microtubules and inhibition of the excessive activation of Akt-mediated Nrf2/ARE pathway-regulated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our present study suggests that metformin administration may provide a potential therapy for SCI.","metformin"

Metformin is a safe drug for controlling blood sugar in diabetes. It has been shown that metformin improves locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Neuropathic pain is also a disturbing component of SCI. It is indicated that metformin has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, which attenuate neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia in injured nerves. Thus, we evaluated metformin's therapeutic effects on SCI neuroinflammation and its sensory and locomotor complications. Meanwhile, results were compared to minocycline, an anti-neuroinflammation therapy in SCI. Experimental Medicine Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran METHODS: In an animal model of SCI, 48 male rats were subjected to T9 vertebra laminectomy. Animals were divided into a SHAM-operated group and five treatment groups. The treatments included normal saline as a vehicle control group, minocycline 90 mg/kg and metformin at the doses of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg. Locomotor scaling, behavioral tests for neuropathic pain and weight changes were evaluated and compared through a 28-days period. At the end of the study, tissue samples were taken to assess neuroinflammatory changes. Metformin 50 mg/kg improved the locomotors ability (p < 0.001) and decreased sensitivity to mechanical and thermal allodynia (p < 0.01). These results were compatible with minocycline effect on SCI (p > 0.05). While metformin led to weight loss, both metformin and minocycline significantly decreased neuroinflammation in the assessment of cord tissue histopathology, and levels of TNF-α and interleukin-1β (p < 0.001). Metformin could be considered as an alternative therapeutic agent for SCI, as it potentially attenuates neuroinflammation, sensory and locomotor complications of cord injury.","metformin"

Secondary injuries, such as apoptosis and cell autophagy, significantly impact the motor function recovery process. Metformin is a widely used oral anti-diabetic agent for type 2 diabetes in the world. It has been demonstrated to promote autophagy and inhibit apoptosis in the nervous system. However, its role in recovery following SCI is still unknown. In this study, we determined that motor function, assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor assessment scale, was significantly higher in rats treated with metformin following injury. Nissl staining revealed that metformin also increased the number of surviving neurons in the spinal cord lesion. Western blot and immunofluorescent analysis revealed that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and P70S6 kinase (P70S6K) decreased, while the expression of autophagy markers increased and apoptosis markers declined in animals treated with metformin following SCI. Taken together, these findings suggest that metformin functions as a neuroprotective agent following SCI by promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis by regulating the mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway.","metformin"

Erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS); however, the molecular mechanisms of its protection against SCI remain unknown. This study aims to investigate whether the neuroprotective effects of EPO on SCI are mediated by autophagy via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. Functional assessment and Nissl staining were used to investigate the effects of EPO on SCI. Expressions of proteins were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Treatment with EPO significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and improved the functional recovery following SCI. Erythropoietin significantly enhanced the SCI-induced autophagy through activating AMPK and inactivating mTOR signaling. The inhibitor of AMPK, compound C, could block the EPO-induced autophagy and beneficial action on SCI, whereas the activator of AMPK, metformin, could mimic the effects of EPO. In the in vitro studies, EPO enhanced the hypoxia-induced autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. The AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy contributes to the neuroprotection of EPO on SCI.","metformin"

Previously, we demonstrated that metformin could improve functional recovery after SCI; however, the effect of metformin on BSCB is still unknown. In this study, we found that metformin could prevent the loss of tight junction (TJ) proteins at day 3 after SCI in vivo, but in vitro there was no significant difference of these proteins between control and metformin treatment in endothelial cells. This indicated that metformin-induced BSCB protection might not be mediated by up-regulating TJ proteins directly, but by inhibiting TJ proteins degradation. Thus, we investigated the role of metformin on MMP-9 and neutrophils infiltration. Neutrophils infiltration is the major source of the enhanced MMP-9 in SCI. Our results showed that metformin decreased MMP-9 production and blocked neutrophils infiltration at day 1 after injury, which might be related to ICAM-1 down-regulation. Also, our in vitro study showed that metformin inhibited TNF-α-induced MMP-9 up-regulation in neutrophils, which might be mediated via an AMPK-dependent pathway. Together, it illustrated that metformin prevented the breakdown of BSCB by inhibiting neutrophils infiltration and MMP-9 production, but not by up-regulating TJ proteins expression. Our study may help to better understand the working mechanism of metformin on SCI.","metformin"

Autophagy is a cellular process to confront with stress after SCI and considered to be a therapeutic target of SCI. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of metformin on functional recovery after SCI and its underlying mechanism of autophagy regulation. Using a rat model of traumatic SCI, we found improved function recovery which was paralleled by a reduction of apoptosis after metformin treatment. We further examined autophagy via detecting autophagosomes by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, as well as autophagy markers by western blot in each groups. The results showed that the number of autophagosomes and expression of autophagy markers such as LC3 and beclin1 were increased in SCI group, while autophagy substrate protein p62 as well as ubiquitinated proteins were found to accumulate in SCI group, indicating an impaired autophagy flux in SCI. But, metformin treatment attenuated the accumulation of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a stimulative effect of autophagy flux by metformin. Blockage of autophagy flux by chloroquine partially abolished the apoptosis inhibition and functional recovery effect of metformin on SCI, which suggested that the protective effect of metformin on SCI was through autophagy flux stimulation. Activation of AMPK as well as inhibition of its downstream mTOR signaling were detected under metformin treatment in vivo and in vitro; inhibition of AMPK signaling by compound C suppressed autophagy flux induced by metformin in vitro, indicating that AMPK signaling was involved in the effect of metformin on autophagy flux regulation. Together, these results illustrated that metformin improved functional recovery effect through autophagy flux stimulation and implied metformin to be a potential drug for SCI therapy.","metformin"

Increase of PPARδ may improve the damage in SCI. Telmisartan, the antihypertensive agent, has been mentioned to increase the expression of PPARδ. Thus, we are going to screen the effectiveness of telmisartan in SCI for the development of it in clinical application. In the present study, we used compressive SCI in rats. Telmisartan was then used to evaluate the influence in rats after SCI. Change in PPARδ expression was identified by Western blots. Also, behavioral tests were performed to check the recovery of damage. Recovery of damage from SCI was observed in telmisartan-treated rats. Additionally, this action of telmisartan was inhibited by GSK0660 at the dose sufficient to block PPARδ. However, metformin at the dose enough to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase failed to produce similar action as telmisartan. Thus, mediation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in this action of telmisartan can be rule out. Moreover, telmisartan reversed the expressions of PPARδ in rats with SCI. The obtained data suggest that telmisartan can improve the damage of SCI in rats through an increase in PPARδ expression. Thus, telmisartan is useful to be developed as an agent in the therapy of SCI.","metformin"

During apoptosis dying cells secrete additional mediators of apoptosis such as cytokines and free radicals which have additional toxic effects and exacerbate neuronal death. The aim of this laboratory study was to investigate the effects of mexiletine on caspase-3 activation and functional recovery and compare its post-SCI effectiveness with methylprednisolone. The rats were divided into five groups. Animals in the trauma group underwent traumatic interventions after laminectomy. Spinal cord contusion injury was produced using the weight-drop method. Animals in treatment groups received a single dose of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Group C), single dose of mexiletine (Group D), or vehicle solution (saline; Group E) intraperitoneally immediately after injury. Hind-limb functions were assessed using the inclined plane technique and caspase-3 activity in tissue samples was measured 24 hours after SCI. Traumatic injury was found to increase tissue caspase-3 activity. In both treatment groups the drug prevented an increase in caspase-3 activity. Mexiletine treatment improved early behavioral recovery after SCI. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that mexiletine treatment inhibits caspase-3 activation and preserve/restore better neuronal function compared with methylprednisolone after experimental SCI.","mexiletine"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Influx of Na(+) ions into cells has been postulated to be a key early event in the pathogenesis of secondary traumatic and ischemic central nervous system injury. Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole--after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), phenytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p<0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na(+) blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin.","mexiletine"

Central myelinated axons are damaged by anoxia/ischemia in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Leakage of Na+ into the axoplasm through Na+ channels causes Ca2+ overload mainly by reverse Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Na+ channel blockers have thus been shown to be protective in an in vitro anoxic rat optic nerve model. Mexiletine (10 microM-1 mM), an antiarrhythmic and use-dependent Na+ channel blocker, was also significantly protective, as measured by recovery of the compound action potential after a 60 min anoxic exposure in vitro. More importantly, mexiletine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly protected optic nerves from injury in a model of in situ ischemia. This in situ model is more clinically relevant as it addresses drug pharmacokinetics, toxicity and CNS penetration. Optic nerve recovery cycles (defined as shifts in latency of compound action potentials with paired stimulation) were used to measure the concentration of mexiletine in optic nerves after systemic administration, estimated at approximately 42 microM 1 h after a single dose of 80 mg/kg, i.p. These results indicate that mexiletine is able to penetrate into the CNS at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Na+ channel blockers such as mexiletine may prove to be effective clinical therapeutic agents for protecting CNS white matter tracts against anoxic/ischemic injury.","mexiletine"

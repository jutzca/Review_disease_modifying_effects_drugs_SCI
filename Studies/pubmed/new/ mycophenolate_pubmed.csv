Young female Wistar albino rats weighing 100-120 g were used in this study. The animals were anesthetized, the paravertebral muscles were dissected to expose thoracic spinal nerve 7 (T7)-T11 vertebrae, and the spinal cord was exposed at T8-T10 levels by laminectomy with the assistance of a surgical microscope. Weight-drop trauma model was used to perform spinal cord trauma. The animals were subjected to an impact of 50 g/cm to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. The animals were divided into six groups, and all the groups include 12 animals. Group 1 laminectomy, group 2 laminectomy+ trauma, group 3 was treated with mycophenolate mofetil, group 4 was treated with methylprednisolone, group 5 was treated with mycophenolate mofetil+methylprednisolone, and group 6 served as a vehicle. Immediately after the trauma, 25 mg/kg mycophenolate mofetil (to group 3 and 5) and 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone (to group 4 and 5) were given in a single dose. Biochemical, behavioral, pathological, and immunohistochemical analysis were done. Significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells were detected in the lesion zone 24 h after the spinal cord injury with the mycophenolate mofetil treatment group. Histologic and functional recovery was also significant. Our results showed that the administration of mycophenolate mofetil on traumatic spinal cord injury decreases apoptosis and improves neurologic recovery.","mycophenolate"

Such a treatment may serve to: I) provide trophic support to improve survival of host neurons; II) improve the structural integrity of the spinal parenchyma by reducing syringomyelia and scarring in trauma-injured regions; and III) provide neuronal populations to potentially form relays with host axons, segmental interneurons, and/or Î±-motoneurons. Here we characterized the effect of intraspinal grafting of clinical grade human fetal spinal cord-derived neural stem cells (HSSC) on the recovery of neurological function in a rat model of acute lumbar (L3) compression injury. Three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received L3 spinal compression injury. Three days post-injury, animals were randomized and received intraspinal injections of either HSSC, media-only, or no injections. All animals were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone acetate from the day of cell grafting and survived for eight weeks. Motor and sensory dysfunction were periodically assessed using open field locomotion scoring, thermal/tactile pain/escape thresholds and myogenic motor evoked potentials. The presence of spasticity was measured by gastrocnemius muscle resistance and electromyography response during computer-controlled ankle rotation. At the end-point, gait (CatWalk), ladder climbing, and single frame analyses were also assessed. Syrinx size, spinal cord dimensions, and extent of scarring were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Differentiation and integration of grafted cells in the host tissue were validated with immunofluorescence staining using human-specific antibodies. Intraspinal grafting of HSSC led to a progressive and significant improvement in lower extremity paw placement, amelioration of spasticity, and normalization in thermal and tactile pain/escape thresholds at eight weeks post-grafting. No significant differences were detected in other CatWalk parameters, motor evoked potentials, open field locomotor (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotion score (BBB)) score or ladder climbing test. Magnetic resonance imaging volume reconstruction and immunofluorescence analysis of grafted cell survival showed near complete injury-cavity-filling by grafted cells and development of putative GABA-ergic synapses between grafted and host neurons. Peri-acute intraspinal grafting of HSSC can represent an effective therapy which ameliorates motor and sensory deficits after traumatic spinal cord injury.","mycophenolate"

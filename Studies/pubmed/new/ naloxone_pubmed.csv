The objective of this study was to evaluate randomized clinical trials that address potential neuroprotective agents used to improve neurological outcome in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations.","naloxone"

The lack of available robust pharmacological treatments underscores the need for novel therapeutic methods and approaches. Due to the complex character of neuropathic pain following SCI, therapies targeting multiple mechanisms may be a better choice for obtaining sufficient long-term pain relief. Previous studies in our lab showed analgesic effects using combinations of an NMDA antagonist peptide [Ser1]histogranin (SHG), and the mu-opioid peptides endomorphins (EMs), in several pain models. As an alternative to drug therapy, this study evaluated the analgesic potential of these peptides when delivered via gene therapy. Lentiviruses encoding SHG and EM-1 and EM-2 were intraspinally injected, either singly or in combination, into rats with clip compression SCI 2 weeks following injury. Treated animals showed significant reduction in mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, compared to control groups injected with GFP vector only. The antinociceptive effects of individually injected components were modest, but the combination of EMs and SHG produced robust and sustained antinociception. The onset of the analgesic effects was observed between 1-5 weeks post-injection and sustained without decrement for at least 7 weeks. No adverse effects on locomotor function were observed. The involvement of SHG and EMs in the observed antinociception was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition using intrathecal injection of either the opioid antagonist naloxone or an anti-SHG antibody. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of SHG and EMs in the spinal cord of treated animals, and immunodot-blot analysis of CSF confirmed the presence of these peptides in injected animals. In a separate group of rats, delayed injection of viral vectors was performed in order to mimic a more likely clinical scenario. Comparable and sustained antinociceptive effects were observed in these animals using the SHG-EMs combination vectors compared to the group with early intervention. Findings from this study support the potential for direct gene therapy to provide a robust and sustained alleviation of chronic neuropathic pain following SCI. The combination strategy utilizing potent mu-opioid peptides with a naturally-derived NMDA antagonist may produce additive or synergistic analgesic effects without the tolerance development for long-term management of persistent pain.","naloxone"

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). In 1990 the results of the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS II) were published, which showed that the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP), which had been previously shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, could improve neurological recovery in spinal-cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI since the drug was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy was obtained in a third NASCIS trial (NASCIS III). In recent years, the use of high-dose MP in acute SCI has become controversial largely on the basis of the risk of serious adverse effects versus what is perceived to be on average a modest neurological benefit. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone was also tested in NASCIS II based upon the demonstration of its beneficial effects in SCI models. Although it did not a significant overall effect, some evidence of efficacy was seen in incomplete (i.e., paretic) patients. The monosialoganglioside GM1 has also been examined in a recently completed clinical trial in which the patients first received high-dose MP treatment. However, GM1 failed to show any evidence of a significant enhancement in the extent of neurological recovery over the level afforded by MP therapy alone. The present paper reviews the past development of MP, naloxone, tirilazad, and GM1 for acute SCI, the ongoing MP-SCI controversy, identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development, and suggests some promising neuroprotective approaches that could either replace or be used in combination with high-dose MP.","naloxone"

However, there are few reports on naloxone for bladder morbidity in acute spinal cord injury. We performed a prospective, controlled study of the effects of naloxone on bladder function in rabbits with and without surgical transection of the spinal cord at the 10th thoracic vertebra. Acute and chronic stages of injury were defined according to bladder function. Naloxone was given intravenously at both stages, and intrathecally at the acute stage. Bladder activity was monitored by cystometry. Blood concentrations of methionine-enkephalin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Spinal cord injuries were acute 1 or 2 days after surgery, and chronic after 1 or 2 weeks. Bladder capacity significantly decreased after 0.01 mg of intravenous naloxone in uninjured control rabbits, and after 0.03 mg of intravenous naloxone in rabbits with chronic-phase injuries. During the acute-injury phase, 0.3 mg of intravenous naloxone, or 0.02 mg of intrathecal naloxone, was necessary to evoke the micturition reflex. No significant changes in blood enkephalin levels were seen before or after spinal cord injury. In rabbits with acute spinal cord injury, intrathecal naloxone evoked the micturition reflex at a much lower dose than did intravenous naloxone. Intrathecal naloxone promises to become a new therapy for the acute stage of spinal cord injury for active recovery of bladder function, and could replace current therapy.","naloxone"

An ip injection of 5 mg/kg naloxone 30 min pre-UL and 5 h post-UL was found to significantly reduce the frequency of spontaneous nystagmus relative to the vehicle control group (P < 0.005). However, a lower dose (2.5 mg/kg) had no effect. At either dose, the effects on the postural symptoms, yaw head tilt and roll head tilt, were small by comparison and in most cases nonsignificant.

While naloxone had no overt effect in acute spinal cats, in chronic spinal cats naloxone induced the release of large volumes of urine and produced marked hind limb hyper-reflexia. Prominent tachyphylaxis and tolerance to the effects of naloxone were evident. Immunohistochemical studies indicated a marked increase in leucine enkephalin and dynorphin in sacral spinal neurons. Together, these data indicate hyperactivity of the endogenous spinal opioid system following recovery from spinal cord injury and, furthermore, suggest that the spinal neural circuitry may become 'dependent' upon elevated levels of endogenous opioid peptides.","naloxone"

Patients who did not undergo surgery had more severe spinal cord injuries initially than those who had surgery. However, no differences in neurological improvement at 1-year follow-up were found between those who underwent surgery and those who did not. The results suggest that either early surgery (< or = 25 hours after injury) or late surgery (> 200 hours) may be associated with increased neurological recovery, particularly motor function, but these results are equivocal. Surgery was not shown to interact with pharmacological treatments, indicating that the effect of drug treatment in NASCIS II, reported elsewhere, is not influenced by surgery. Other independent variables that best predicted improvement in motor score were age of 25 years or younger, incomplete injury, and lower baseline emergency department neurological scores. This study does not provide clinically relevant evidence concerning the efficacy of timing or the value of surgery in treating patients with spinal cord injuries. A randomized study on the timing and efficacy of spinal cord surgery is needed to obtain valid comparisons of the efficacy of surgical treatments.","naloxone"

Recovery at the injury level could be of considerable clinical significance, but long-tract recovery is the ultimate therapeutic goal. This analysis demonstrates that the greatest proportion of all neurological recovery and of recovery due to treatment with very high doses of methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury occurs below the lesion. Methylprednisolone treatment administered early following injury has been found to improve recovery below the lesion in patients initially diagnosed as having complete or incomplete injuries; it also leads to greater (but still relatively small) improvement in the injury level. The analysis indicates that delayed treatment with methylprednisolone is associated with decreased neurological recovery. Naloxone administration also improved neurological function below the lesion in patients with incomplete injuries; these results support further experimental work with this drug. This observation of differential neurological response within a narrow treatment window has important implications for both experimental studies and clinical management. Early clinical management with high-dose methylprednisolone is supported by this analysis.","naloxone"

The delayed decline of evoked potentials and blood flow suggest secondary injury processes that may respond to pharmacological therapy. High dose methylprednisolone (15-30 mg/kg) dramatically improved blood flow, extracellular ionic shifts, blood flow, and evoked potentials in cat spinal cords. Methylprednisolone also decreased tissue ionic shifts and improved locomotory recovery. In concomitant experiments, we showed that naloxone also prevented posttraumatic declines in blood flow and improved locomotory recovery. Examination of the spinal cords at 6-12 weeks after injury, revealed that many recovered animals had only 10% of spinal cord axons remaining.

In acute spinal cats micturition reflexes were blocked, however, several weeks after transection, a long latency (180-200 ms) spinal reflex could be activated by C-fiber bladder afferents. This reflex was blocked by capsaicin in doses (20-30 mg/kg, s.c.) that did not affect micturition reflexes in intact cats. Micturition reflexes were unmasked in acute spinal and facilitated in chronic spinal cats by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Spinal neurons and axons containing opioid peptides were more prominent below the level of transection in chronic spinal cats. VIP, a putative neurotransmitter in C-fiber bladder afferents, inhibited micturition reflexes when injected intrathecally (2-10 micrograms) in intact cats but facilitated micturition reflexes in spinal cats (doses 0.1-1 micrograms, i.t.). VIP-containing C-fiber afferent projections to lamina I of the sacral spinal cord expanded in spinal cats. Thus VIP afferents may have an important role in the recovery of bladder reflexes after spinal injury. Paraplegic animals also exhibit bladder-sphincter dyssynergia, which causes functional outlet obstruction. Studies in rats have revealed that outlet obstruction induced by partial urethral ligation facilitates spinal micturition reflex pathways and causes an expansion of HRP-labelled bladder afferent projections in the spinal cord. These findings raise the possibility that the alterations in central reflex connections in paraplegic animals may be induced in part by changes in peripheral afferent input secondary to outlet obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","naloxone"

Because of the demonstrated beneficial effects of other opiate-receptor antagonists in spinal cord injury (SCI) and the postulated role of kappa opiate receptors in such injury, nalmefene treatment was evaluated in a well-characterized model of traumatic SCI in rats. In a randomized blinded study, nalmefene treatment, given as a single i.v. bolus injection at 60 min posttrauma, significantly improved neurological recovery and reduced tissue damage. Beneficial actions were dose-related. The optimal dose was 0.1 mg/kg, with diminished effects at both higher and lower doses; this is approximately 1% of the optimal naloxone dose in SCI as shown from other studies. Nalmefene, given i.t. at doses that were ineffective systemically, significantly improved neurological recovery after spinal trauma. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous opioids, acting at opiate receptors within the spinal cord, mediate certain secondary pathophysiological changes that contribute to irreversible tissue injury.

Opiate antagonists improve spinal cord blood flow, electrical conduction of the spinal cord, pathological changes, and motor recovery following traumatic spinal cord injury in cats. TRH appears to be superior to naloxone in this regard, although direct comparisons between receptor-selective opiate receptor antagonists and TRH have not been made. Similarly, opiate antagonists are effective in improving outcome and reducing pathological changes following ischemic spinal cord injury in rabbits. Beneficial effects for opiate receptor antagonists have also been observed after fluid percussion head injury in cats. Effects of opiate antagonists in the treatment of experimental stroke have been more controversial, although the weight of evidence supports a therapeutic effect in various models and species. Following spinal cord injury, best evidence suggests that pathophysiological responses produced by opioids may be mediated by the dynorphin opioid system and/or the kappa opiate receptor. This issue is of considerable importance, since it may lead to the development of more effective and specific forms of therapy. The role of specific opioid systems and specific opiate receptors in traumatic head injury or cerebral ischemia have not been adequately studied and should be the subject of future investigation.

Naloxone treatment also significantly improved functional neurological recovery after severe injury. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), possibly through its ""anti-endorphin"" actions, was even more effective than naloxone in improving functional recovery in the cat.

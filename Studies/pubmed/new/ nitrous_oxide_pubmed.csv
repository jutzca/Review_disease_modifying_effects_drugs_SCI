The authors hypothesized that exposure to nitrous oxide impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery after central nervous system injury. The consequences of single and serial in vivo nitrous oxide exposures on axon regeneration in four experimental male rat models of nervous system injury were measured: in vitro axon regeneration in cell culture after in vivo nitrous oxide administration, in vivo axon regeneration after sharp spinal cord injury, in vivo axon regeneration after sharp optic nerve injury, and in vivo functional recovery after blunt contusion spinal cord injury. In vitro axon regeneration 48 h after a single in vivo 70% N2O exposure is less than half that in the absence of nitrous oxide (mean ± SD, 478 ± 275 um; n = 48) versus 210 ± 152 um (n = 48; P < 0.0001). A single exposure to 80% N2O inhibits the beneficial effects of folic acid on in vivo axonal regeneration after sharp spinal cord injury (13.4 ± 7.1% regenerating neurons [n = 12] vs. 0.6 ± 0.7% regenerating neurons [n = 4], P = 0.004). Serial 80% N2O administration reverses the benefit of folic acid on in vivo retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after sharp optic nerve injury (1277 ± 180 regenerating retinal ganglion cells [n = 7] vs. 895 ± 164 regenerating retinal ganglion cells [n = 7], P = 0.005). Serial 80% N2O exposures reverses the benefit of folic acid on in vivo functional recovery after blunt spinal cord contusion (estimate for fixed effects ± standard error of the estimate: folic acid 5.60 ± 0.54 [n = 9] vs. folic acid + 80% N2O 5.19 ± 0.62 [n = 7], P < 0.0001). These data indicate that nitrous oxide can impair the ability of central nervous system neurons to regenerate axons after sharp and blunt trauma.","nitrous_oxide"

Adult rats were implanted with various sizes of hygroscopic plastic material at the T12 spinal level to determine the dimensions that would produce a progressive neurologic deficit from which recovery could occur. Neurologic evaluation was conducted on an inclined plane, noting the maximum angle at which an animal was able to maintain orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal midline. Scores were statistically modeled for each group to develop profiles of neurologic deficits. Rats were subjected to a 4-h exposure to isoflurane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or ketamine 7 or 8 days postimplantation. Neurologic outcomes were compared to a SCI reference group which received no postimplant anesthesia. An animal weight/desiccated implant volume (Wa/Vi) ratio of 53 to 73 g/mm3 produced postimplant neurologic deficits which deteriorated to near maximum within 3 days, followed by a gradual improvement beginning at Day 8 and returning to near normal between 21 and 25 days. Final outcome was based on modeled ramp scores for each group and reported in degrees +/- SD: reference, 71.2 +/- 1.1; fentanyl/N2O, 70.4 +/- 0.3; isoflurane, 72.6 +/- 1.1; and ketamine, 64.9 +/- 0.6. The fentanyl group attained maximum recovery first (P > 0.05) but did not recover to a level different on the average from the reference group. The ketamine group demonstrated a poorer (P > 0.05) recovery level relative to the other anesthetic protocols.","nitrous_oxide"

Neurologic function was assessed in a blinded fashion for one week after injury using a modification of the method of Tarlov. The post-mortem concentrations of serotonin and its metabolite were measured in injured and surrounding spinal tissues in a subset of animals in order to estimate the survival of descending long-tract axons. In initial studies using non-ventilated animals where body temperature was not controlled (n = 130), halothane anesthesia was associated with significantly better neurologic scores at all levels of injury (50, 100 and 250 g.cm) in comparison to pentobarbital. In a second experiment under these conditions (n = 53) the effect of halothane was observed after a 50 g.cm injury in comparison to both pentobarbital and nitrous oxide. Improved neurologic recovery was accompanied by the preservation of normal serotonin and metabolite concentrations in spinal tissue caudal to the site of injury. These values did not differ from those measured in sham-operated animals. Separate experiments (n = 12) revealed halothane's preservation of somatosensory-evoked responses during the early postinjury period in animals showing improved neurologic recovery. Subsequent experiments (n = 12) were performed to assess the effect of oxygen supplementation and the control of rectal temperature and a separate series of acute experiments (n = 14) examined arterial blood pressure responses to injury in halothane- and pentobarbital-anesthetized animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","nitrous_oxide"

Because opioids are used in clinical anesthesia, the effect of an opiate antagonist was evaluated on neurologic outcome in a rat model of spinal cord injury occurring during opioid anesthesia. One day prior to spinal cord injury, a catheter was inserted into the spinal subarachnoid space with the tip at T8. On the day of spinal cord injury a balloon tipped catheter was inserted in the epidural space with the tip at the thoracolumbar junction. Spinal cord injury was produced by balloon inflation during one of the following states: 1) group 1 (A/S), injury was produced in awake rats and saline was administered in the subarachnoid space immediately following injury; 2) group 2 (F/S), injury was produced during a fentanyl/nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthetic, and subarachnoid saline administered; and 3) group 3 (F/Nx), injury was produced during a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, and subarachnoid naloxone (1 mg/kg) was administered immediately following injury. Dose-response curves describing the relationship between the duration of balloon inflation and the percentage of animals with a persistent neurologic deficit were constructed and compared for differences by use of a group t test. The duration of balloon inflation required to produce a neurologic deficit was greater in both the F/S and F/Nx groups than in the A/S group (P less than 0.05). There was no difference between the F/S and F/Nx groups. In summary, in rats receiving a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, neurologic outcome was improved compared with the awake state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","nitrous_oxide"

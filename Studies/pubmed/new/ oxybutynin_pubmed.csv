Fifteen consecutive neurologically impaired patients (8 from multiple sclerosis, 4 from spinal cord injury, 3 from other causes) with complications of previous bladder management underwent ileovesicostomy. There were 10 women and 5 men. All patients were either poor candidates for or refused continent urinary diversion or bladder augmentation cystoplasty. At a mean follow-up of 23.2 months, 14 of 15 patients had low-pressure urine drainage through their ileovesicostomy. Four women with documented preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia had postoperative intermittent mild urge incontinence per native urethra. They did not require any further treatment, except for oral anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin and tolterodine). Because of persistent severe urge incontinence, 1 woman required conversion of her ileovesicostomy to an ileal conduit with concurrent cystectomy. The ileovesicostomy of another myelodysplastic man who had four failed artificial urinary sphincters in the past was also converted to an ileal conduit because of persistent urethroperineal fistula despite perineal urethral closure. Renal function was preserved in all patients. Long-term complications were stomal stenosis in 2 patients, bladder and kidney stone formation in 5, and symptomatic urinary tract infections in 3. Ileovesicostomy can be safely performed in neurologically impaired women and men. Severe preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary. In addition, in cases of neural recovery, the ileal ""chimney"" can be excised and the patient's original lower urinary tract would be preserved.","oxybutynin"

The long-term follow-up shows that there is a good recovery and the complication rate is low.","oxybutynin"

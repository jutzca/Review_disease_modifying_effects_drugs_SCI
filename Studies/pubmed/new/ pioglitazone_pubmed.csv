Acute treatment after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats is reported to suppress neuroinflammation, rescue injured tissues, and improve locomotor recovery. In the current study, we additionally assessed the protective efficacy of pioglitazone treatment on acute mitochondrial respiration, as well as functional and anatomical recovery after contusion SCI in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Mice received either vehicle or pioglitazone (10mg/kg) at either 15min or 3h after injury (75kdyn at T9) followed by a booster at 24h post-injury. At 25h, mitochondria were isolated from spinal cord segments centered on the injury epicenters and assessed for their respiratory capacity. Results showed significantly compromised mitochondrial respiration 25h following SCI, but pioglitazone treatment that was initiated either at 15min or 3h post-injury significantly maintained mitochondrial respiration rates near sham levels. A second cohort of injured mice received pioglitazone at 15min post injury, then once a day for 5days post-injury to assess locomotor recovery and tissue sparing over 4weeks. Compared to vehicle, pioglitazone treatment resulted in significantly greater recovery of hind-limb function over time, as determined by serial locomotor BMS assessments and both terminal BMS subscores and gridwalk performance. Such improvements correlated with significantly increased grey and white matter tissue sparing, although pioglitazone treatment did not abrogate long-term injury-induced inflammatory microglia/macrophage responses. In sum, pioglitazone significantly increased functional neuroprotection that was associated with remarkable maintenance of acute mitochondrial bioenergetics after traumatic SCI. This sets the stage for dose-response and delayed administration studies to maximize pioglitazone's efficacy for SCI while elucidating the precise role that mitochondria play in governing its neuroprotection; the ultimate goal to develop novel therapeutics that specifically target mitochondrial dysfunction.","pioglitazone"

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are widely expressed nuclear receptors whose activation has led to diminished pro-inflammatory cascades in several CNS disorders. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of the PPARgamma agonist Pioglitazone in a rodent SCI model. Rats received a moderate mid-thoracic contusion and were randomly placed into groups receiving vehicle, low dose or high dose Pioglitazone. Drug or vehicle was injected i.p. at 15 min post-injury and then every 12 h for the first 7 days post-injury. Locomotor function was followed for 5 weeks using the BBB scale. BBB scores were greater in treated animals at 7 days post-injury and significant improvements in BBB subscores were noted, including better toe clearance, earlier stepping and more parallel paw position. Stereological measurements throughout the lesion revealed a significant increase in rostral spared white matter in both Pioglitazone treatment groups. Spinal cords from the high dose group also had significantly more gray matter sparing and motor neurons rostral and caudal to epicenter. Thus, our results reveal that clinical treatment with Pioglitazone, an FDA-approved drug used currently for diabetes, may be a feasible and promising strategy for promoting anatomical and functional repair after SCI.","pioglitazone"

TZDs were shown to induce neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia by blocking inflammation. As spinal cord injury (SCI) induces massive inflammation that precipitates secondary neuronal death, we currently analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of TZDs pioglitazone and rosiglitazone after SCI in adult rats. Both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (1.5 mg/kg i.p.; four doses at 5 min and 12, 24, and 48 h) significantly decreased the lesion size (by 57 to 68%, p < 0.05), motor neuron loss (by 3- to 10-fold, p < 0.05), myelin loss (by 66 to 75%, p < 0.05), astrogliosis (by 46 to 61%, p < 0.05), and microglial activation (by 59 to 78%, p < 0.05) after SCI. TZDs significantly enhanced the motor function recovery (at 7 days after SCI, the motor scores were 37 to 45% higher in the TZD groups over the vehicle group; p < 0.05), but the treatment was effective only when the first injection was given by 2 h after SCI. At 28 days after SCI, chronic thermal hyperalgesia was decreased significantly (by 31 to 39%; p < 0.05) in the pioglitazone group compared with the vehicle group. At 6 h after SCI, the pioglitazone group showed significantly less induction of inflammatory genes [interleukin (IL)-6 by 83%, IL-1beta by 87%, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by 75%, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 by 84%, and early growth response-1 by 67%] compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.05 in all cases). Pioglitazone also significantly enhanced the post-SCI induction of neuroprotective heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes. Pretreatment with a PPARgamma antagonist, 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-phenyl-benzamide (GW9662), prevented the neuroprotection induced by pioglitazone.","pioglitazone"

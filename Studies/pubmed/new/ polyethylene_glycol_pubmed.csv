Here, we provide such evidence in dogs followed up over 6 months and in 2 cases up to 1 year along with imaging and histologic data. We show that dogs whose dorsal cord has been fully transected recover locomotion after immediate treatment with a fusogen (PEG). No pain syndrome ensued over the long term. Diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance and histological, including immunohistochemical, data confirmed the re-establishment of anatomical continuity along with interfacial axonal sprouting.

The subject is not frequently approached - according to a literature review with systematic elements, which we have done before - thus constituting a niche that deserves to be further explored. The applicative component of the article highlights statistical data resulted from a retrospective study regarding the specialized casuistry from the Neuromuscular Recovery Clinic of the ""Bagdasar Arseni"" Emergency Clinical Hospital, following the comparative analysis of two groups of patients with recent SCI: non-consumers - the control group (n=780) - and chronic ethanol consumers - the study group (n=225) - with the addition of a prospective pilot component. Data processing has been achieved with SPSS 24. The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) mean motor scores differ significantly (tests: Mann-Whitney and t) between the control and study group in favor of the second, both at admission (p<0.001) and at discharge (p<0.001). AIS mean sensitive scores differ between the two lots, and also in favor of the study, but statistically significant only at discharge (p=0.048); the difference at admission is not significant (p=0.51) - possibly because of alcoholic-nutritional polyneuropathy. These findings, with numerous related details, later presented in the text, are surprising, which requires further studies and attempts of understanding.","polyethylene_glycol"

Treatment of SCI still remains a tremendous challenge clinically. Minocycline could target comprehensive secondary injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a known sealing agent, is able to seal the damaged cell membranes and reduce calcium influx, thereby exerting neuroprotective capacity. Here, an E-selectin-targeting sialic acid - polyethylene glycol - poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SAPP) copolymer was designed for delivering hydrophobic minocycline to achieve combinational therapy of SCI. The obtained SAPP copolymer could self-assemble into micelles with critical micelle concentration being of 13.40 μg/mL, and effectively encapsulate hydrophobic minocycline. The prepared drug-loaded micelles (SAPPM) displayed sustained drug release over 72 h, which could stop microglia activation and exhibited excellent neuroprotective capacity in vitro. The SAPP micelles were efficiently accumulated in the lesion site of SCI rats via the specific binding between sialic acid and E-selectin. Due to the targeting distribution and combinational effect between PEG and minocycline, SAPPM could obviously reduce the area of lesion cavity, and realize more survival of axons and myelin sheaths from the injury, thus distinctly improving hindlimb functional recovery of SCI rats and conferring superior therapeutic effect in coparison with other groups. Our work presented an effective and safe strategy for SCI targeting therapy. Besides, neuroprotective capacity of PEG deserves further investigation on other central nervous system diseases.","polyethylene_glycol"

A neuron's response to axon injury results from a complex interplay of neuron-intrinsic and environmental factors. The contribution of axotomy to the death of neurons in spinal cord injury is controversial because very remote axotomy is unlikely to result in neuronal death, whereas death of neurons near an injury may reflect environmental factors such as ischemia and inflammation. In lampreys, axotomy due to spinal cord injury results in delayed apoptosis of spinal-projecting neurons in the brain, beyond the extent of these environmental factors. This retrograde apoptosis correlates with delayed resealing of the axon, and can be reversed by inducing rapid membrane resealing with polyethylene glycol. Studies in mammals also suggest that polyethylene glycol may be neuroprotective, although the mechanism(s) remain unclear. This review examines the early, mechanical, responses to axon injury in both mammals and lampreys, and the potential of polyethylene glycol to reduce injury-induced pathology. Identifying the mechanisms underlying a neuron's response to axotomy will potentially reveal new therapeutic targets to enhance regeneration and functional recovery in humans with spinal cord injury.","polyethylene_glycol"

In this study, we aim to develop a clinically feasible way for targeted delivery of multiple drugs with different physiochemical properties to the SCI site, detail the underlying mechanism of neural recovery, and detect any synergistic effect related to combination therapy. Methods: Liposomes (LIP) modified with a scar-targeted tetrapeptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) were first constructed to simultaneously encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and then were further added into a thermosensitive heparin-modified poloxamer hydrogel (HP) with affinity-bound acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF-HP) for local administration into the SCI site (CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP) in a rat model. In vivo fluorescence imaging was used to examine the specificity of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX binding to the injured site. Multiple comprehensive evaluations including biotin dextran amine anterograde tracing and magnetic resonance imaging were used to detect any synergistic effects and the underlying mechanisms of CAQK-LIP-GFs/DTX@HP both in vivo (rat SCI model) and in vitro (primary neuron). Results: The multiple drugs were effectively delivered to the injured site. The combined application of GFs and DTX supported neuro-regeneration by improving neuronal survival and plasticity, rendering a more permissive extracellular matrix environment with improved regeneration potential. In addition, our combination therapy promoted axonal regeneration via moderation of microtubule function and mitochondrial transport along the regenerating axon. Conclusion: This novel multifunctional therapeutic strategy with a scar-homing delivery system may offer promising translational prospects for the clinical treatment of SCI.","polyethylene_glycol"

To address spinal cord injuries, an injectable in situ gelling system was tested utilizing a simple, effective, and rapid cross-linking method via Michael addition. Thiolated chitosan material and maleimide-terminated polyethylene glycol material were mixed to form a hydrogel and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Three distinct thiolated chitosan precursors were made by varying reaction conditions; a modification of chitosan with Traut's reagent (2-iminothiolane) displayed the most attractive hydrogel properties once mixed with polyethylene glycol. The final hydrogel chosen for animal testing had a swelling ratio (Q) of 57.5 ± 3.4 and elastic modulus of 378 ± 72 Pa. After confirming low cellular toxicity in vitro, the hydrogel was injected into the spinal cord of rats for 1 and 2 weeks to assess host reaction. The rats displayed no overt functional deficits due to injection following initial surgical recovery and throughout the 2-week period after for both the saline-injected sham group and hydrogel-injected group. The saline and hydrogel-injected animals both showed a similar response from ED1+ microglia and GFAP overexpression. No significant differences were found between saline-injected and hydrogel-injected groups for any of the measures studied, but there was a trend toward decreased affected area size from 1 to 2 weeks in both groups. Access to the central nervous system is limited by the blood-brain barrier for noninvasive therapies; further development of the current system for localized drug or cellular delivery has the potential to shape treatments of spinal cord injury.","polyethylene_glycol"

To mimic the natural environment of the spinal cord tissue, a three-dimensional hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) with oriented topography and soft stiffness has been fabricated by electrospinning and a concurrent molecular self-assembling process. In this study, the AFG was implanted into a rat dorsal hemisected spinal cord injury model to bridge the lesion site. Host cells invaded promptly along the aligned fibrin hydrogels to form aligned tissue cables in the first week, and then were followed by axonal regrowth. At 4 weeks after the surgery, neurofilament (NF)-positive staining fibers were detected near the rostral end as well as the middle site of defect, which aligned along the tissue cables. Abundant NF- and GAP-43-positive staining indicated new axon regrowth in the oriented tissue cables, which penetrated throughout the lesion site in 8 weeks. Additionally, the abundant blood vessels marked with RECA-1 had reconstructed within the lesion site at 4 weeks after surgery. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scoring showed that the locomotor performance of the AFG group recovered much faster than that of blank control group or the random fibrin hydrogel (RFG) group from 2 weeks after surgery. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging tractography of MRI confirmed the optimal axon fiber reconstruction compared with the RFG and control groups. Taken together, our results suggested that the AFG scaffold provided an inductive matrix for accelerating directional host cell invasion, vascular system reconstruction, and axonal regrowth, which could promote and support extensive aligned axonal regrowth and locomotor function recovery.","polyethylene_glycol"

In addition, proposed treatments that demonstrated functional recovery in animal models of acute SCI have failed almost invariably when applied to chronic injury models. Glial scar formation in chronic injury is a likely contributor to limitation on regeneration. We have removed existing scar tissue in chronically contused rat spinal cord using a rose Bengal-based photo ablation approach. In this study, we compared two chemically modified rose bengal derivatives to unmodified rose bengal, both confirming and expanding on our previously published report. Rats were treated with unmodified rose bengal (RB1) or rose bengal modified with hydrocarbon (RB2) or polyethylene glycol (RB3), to determine the effects on scar components and spared tissue post-treatment. Our results showed that RB1 was more efficacious than RB2, while still maintaining minimal collateral effects on spared tissue. RB3 was not taken up by the cells, likely because of its size, and therefore had no effect. Treatment with RB1 also resulted in an increase in serotonin eight days post-treatment in chronically injured spinal cords. Thus, we suggest that unmodified rose Bengal is a potent candidate agent for the development of a therapeutic strategy for scar ablation in chronic SCI.","polyethylene_glycol"

We designed a scaffold material for SCI treatment containing only chitosan and water as fragmented physical hydrogel suspension (Chitosan-FPHS), with defined degree of acetylation (DA), polymer concentration, and mean fragment size. Implantation of Chitosan-FPHS alone into rat spinal cord immediately after a bilateral dorsal hemisection promoted reconstitution of spinal tissue and vasculature, and diminished fibrous glial scarring: with astrocyte processes primarily oriented towards the lesion, the border between lesion site and intact tissue became permissive for regrowth of numerous axons into, and for some even beyond the lesion site. Growing axons were myelinated or ensheathed by endogenous Schwann cells that migrated into the lesion site and whose survival was prolonged. Interestingly, Chitosan-FPHS also modulated the inflammatory response, and we suggest that this might contribute to tissue repair.

We hypothesized that tissue and functional repair would be achieved in a rat model of impact-compression SCI by combining degradation of the glial scar, using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), with recruitment of endogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs), using stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF). To test this hypothesis, we designed a crosslinked methylcellulose hydrogel (XMC) for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal drug delivery. ChABC was released from XMC using protein-peptide affinity interactions while SDF was delivered by electrostatic affinity interactions from polymeric nanoparticles embedded in XMC. Rats with SCI were treated acutely with a combination of SDF and ChABC, SDF alone, ChABC alone, or vehicle alone, and compared to injury only. Treatment with ChABC, both alone and in combination with SDF, resulted in faster and more sustained behavioural improvement over time than other groups. The significantly reduced chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan levels and greater distribution of NPCs throughout the spinal cord tissue with ChABC delivery, both alone and in combination with SDF, may explain the improved locomotor function. Treatment with SDF alone had no apparent effect on NPC number or distribution nor synergistic effect with ChABC delivery.

Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective. Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.","polyethylene_glycol"

The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, an activity box test, and a swimming test were used to evaluate behavioral recovery over a 4-week period. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords was performed to measure the extent and volume of the lesion, axonal preservation, serotonergic and glutamatergic fiber sparing, motor neuron survival, and inflammation. Our results show that only the riluzole treatment significantly improved behavioral recovery up to 4 weeks after injury when compared with saline controls (6.2±1.8), with animals achieving weight-supported stepping (9.1±1.2). Riluzole also promoted tissue sparing with significant differences achieved from 200 to 600 µm (caudally to the lesion epicenter), and reduced lesion volume, with animals presenting a significantly smaller lesion (3.23±0.26 mm(3)) when compared with the saline-treated group (4.74±0.80 mm(3)), representing a 32% decrease in lesion volume. Riluzole treatment induced significant axonal preservation, as well as serotonergic fiber sparing, caudally to the injury epicenter. Our results suggest that the combined treatment, although simultaneously targeting two excitotoxic-related mechanisms, did not further improve behavioral and histologic outcome when compared with riluzole given alone.","polyethylene_glycol"

The compound action potential (CAP) was recorded before and after injury to assess the functional recovery. Furthermore, injury potential, the difference in gap potentials before and after compression, and the concentration of intracellular ions were used to evaluate the effect of DSPE-PEG on reducing ion influx. Data showed that the injury potential and ion concentration of the untreated, PEG and DSPE-PEG group, without significant difference among them, are remarkably higher than those of the intact group. Moreover, the CAP recovery of the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated spinal cords was significantly greater than that of the untreated spinal cords. The level of CAP recovery in the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated groups was the same, but the concentration of DSPE-PEG used was much lower than the concentration of PEG. These results suggest that instant application of DSPE-PEG could effectively repair functional disturbance in SCI at a much lower concentration than PEG.","polyethylene_glycol"

To engineer new CNS tissue, a unique spinal cord bridge is created to deliver stem cells and guide their organization and development with site-specifically immobilized growth factors. In this study, this bridge is tested, consisting of adult neural stem/progenitor cells contained within a methacrylamide chitosan (MAC) hydrogel and protected by a chitosan conduit. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) are recombinantly produced and tagged with an N-terminal biotin. They are immobilized to streptavidin-functionalized MAC to induce either neuronal or oligodendrocytic lineages, respectively. These bridges are tested in a rat hemisection model of SCI between T8 and T9. After eight weeks treatments including chitosan conduits result in a significant reduction in lesion area and macrophage infiltration around the lesion site (p < 0.0001). Importantly, neither immobilized IFN-γ nor PDGF-AA increased macrophage infiltration. Retrograde tracing demonstrates improved neuronal regeneration through the use of immobilized growth factors.

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI.","polyethylene_glycol"

Results indicated that iNSCs showed similar morphological features with wild-type neural stem cells (wt-NSCs), and expressed a variety of neural stem cell marker genes.

In cases that the ruptured zone size is beyond the natural resealing ability, there is a need for reinforcing factors such as polymers (e.g. Polyethylene glycol) to patch the dismantled axoplasm. Certain conserved sequential and structural patterns of interacting residues specifically bind to PEGs. It is also found that PEG600, PEG400 and PEG200 share the strongest interaction with the lipid-binding domains even more successful than phospholipid head groups. The alpha helix structure composed of hydrophobic, neutral and acidic residues prepares an opportunity for PEG400 to play an amphipathic role in the interaction with injured membrane.

Apamin, one of the major components of honey bee venom, serves as the targeting moiety, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) serves as the drug-loaded material, and curcumin is used as the therapeutic agent.

Immunohistological staining revealed marked differences between these compounds regarding axon regeneration, invasion/elongation of astrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial and Schwann cells, revascularization, and collagen deposition. According to axon regeneration-supporting effects, the biopolymers could be ranked in the order PEG>alginate-hydrogel>Matrigel™. Even after complete chronic transection, the PEG-bridge allowed long-distance axon regeneration through the grafted area and for, at least, 1cm beyond the lesion/graft border.

Thus, PEG repairs mechanically injured cells by at least two distinct pathways: resealing of the disrupted plasma membrane and direct protection of mitochondria. Besides repairing primary membrane damage, PEG treatment also results in significant attenuation of oxidative stress, likely due to its capacity to reseal the membrane, thereby breaking the cycle of cellular damage and free-radical production. Based on this, in addition to the practicality of its application, we expect that PEG may be established as an effective treatment for SCI where membrane disruption and mitochondrial damage are implicated.","polyethylene_glycol"

The effects of PEGs (400, 1,000 and 2,000 Da) were studied at different temperatures (25, 37 and 40 °C) by means of compound action potential (CAP) recovery and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Isolated spinal cords were mounted in a double sucrose gap chamber, where the amplitude and area of CAPs were recorded after implementing injury, in the presence and absence of PEG. Moreover, the LDH assay was used to assess the effects of PEG on membrane resealing. Data showed that the least CAP recovery occurred at 25 °C, followed by 37 and 40 °C, in all treated groups. Moreover, maximum CAP amplitude recovery, 65.46 ± 5.04 %, was monitored in the presence of PEG400 at 40 °C, followed by 41.49 ± 2.41 % in PEG1000 and 37.36 ± 1.62 % in PEG2000.

We compared the effect of treatment with a pHEMA-5HT hydrogel seeded with SPC-01_GFP3 cells, treatment with a pHEMA-5HT only and no treatment on functional outcome and tissue reconstruction in hemisected rats. Prior to transplantation the cell-polymer construct displayed a high potential to support the growth, proliferation and differentiation of SPC-01 cells in vitro. One month after surgery, combined hydrogel-cell treatment reduced astrogliosis and tissue atrophy and increased axonal and blood vessel ingrowth into the implant; however, two months later only the ingrowth of blood vessels remained increased. SPC-01_GFP3 cells survived well in vivo and expressed advanced markers of neuronal differentiation. However, a majority of the transplanted cells migrated out of the lesion and only rarely remained in the hydrogel. No differences among the groups in motor or sensory recovery were observed. Despite the support of the hydrogel as a cell carrier in vitro, and good results in vivo one month postsurgery, there was only a small effect on long term recovery, mainly due to the limited ability of the hydrogels to support the in vivo growth and differentiation of cells within the implant. Further modifications will be necessary to achieve stable long term improvement in functional outcome.","polyethylene_glycol"

The primary aim of this work was to assess the recovery of both spontaneous and skilled forelimb function following a cervical dorsolateral funiculotomy in the rat. This injury ablates the rubrospinal tract (RST) but spares the dorsal and ventral corticospinal tract and can severely impair reaching and grasping abilities. Animals received an implant of either PNIPAAm-g-PEG or PNIPAAm-g-PEG + brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The single-pellet reach-to-grasp task and the staircase-reaching task were used to assess skilled motor function associated with reaching and grasping abilities, and the cylinder task was used to assess spontaneous motor function, both before and after injury. Because BDNF can stimulate regenerating RST axons, the authors showed that animals receiving an implant of PNIPAAm-g-PEG with codissolved BDNF had an increased recovery rate of fine motor function when compared with a control group (PNIPAAm-g-PEG only) on both a staircase-reaching task at 4 and 8 weeks post-SCI and on a single-pellet reach-to-grasp task at 5 weeks post-SCI. In addition, spontaneous motor function, as measured in the cylinder test, recovered to preinjury values in animals receiving PNIPAAm-g-PEG + BDNF. Fluorescence immunochemistry indicated the presence of both regenerating axons and BDA-labeled fibers growing up to or within the host-graft interface in animals receiving PNIPAAm-g-PEG + BDNF. Based on their results, the authors suggest that BDNF delivered by the scaffold promoted the growth of RST axons into the lesion, which may have contributed in part to the increased recovery rate.","polyethylene_glycol"

The rate of recovery was maximum with a polynomial trend, when the damaged spinal cord was treated with PEG200 for 25 minutes. The analysis of survival rate of mechanically damaged cells in culture, measured by MTT assay, showed that again smaller PEGs, caused higher membrane sealing rate; 77.8±3.5 for PEG400 (20% w/w) vs 32.1±6.9 for PEG2000 (20% w/w).

In an attempt to achieve greater survival and integration with the host tissue, we examined the survival and efficacy of adult brain-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) injected within a hydrogel blend of hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) into a subacute, clinically relevant model of rat SCI. Prior to use, HAMC was covalently modified with recombinant rat platelet-derived growth factor-A (rPDGF-A) to promote oligodendrocytic differentiation. SCI rats transplanted with NSPCs in HAMC-rPDGF-A showed improved behavioral recovery compared to rats transplanted with NSPCs in media. Rats with NSPC/HAMC-rPDGF-A transplants had a significant reduction in cavitation, improved graft survival, increased oligodendrocytic differentiation, and sparing of perilesional host oligodendrocytes and neurons.

Currently, there are no therapeutic means to address this devastating complication in patients and furthermore once PTS is diagnosed, treatment is often prone to failure. We hypothesized that reducing subarachnoid inflammation using a novel bioengineered strategy would improve outcome in a rodent model of PTS. A hydrogel of hyaluronan and methyl cellulose (HAMC) was injected into the subarachnoid space 24 h post PTS injury in rats. Intrathecal injection of HAMC reduced the extent of fibrosis and inflammation in the subarachnoid space. Furthermore, HAMC promoted improved neurobehavioural recovery, enhanced axonal conduction and reduced the extent of the lesion as assessed by MRI and histomorphometric assessment. These findings were additionally associated with a reduction in the post-traumatic parenchymal fibrous scar formation as evidenced by reduced CSPG deposition and reduced IL-1α cytokine levels.

We hypothesized that administration of SWNT-PEG after experimental SCI will promote regeneration of axons into the lesion cavity and functional recovery of the hindlimbs. To evaluate this hypothesis, complete transection SCI was induced at the T9 vertebral level in adult female rats. One week after transection, the epicenter of the lesion was injected with 25??L of either vehicle (saline), or 1??g/mL, 10??g/mL, or 100??g/mL of SWNT-PEG. Behavioral analysis was conducted before injury, before treatment, and once every 7 days for 28 days after treatment. At 28 days post-injection the rats were euthanized and spinal cord tissue was extracted. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the area of the cyst, the extent of the glial scar, and axonal morphology. We found that post-SCI administration of SWNT-PEG decreased lesion volume, increased neurofilament-positive fibers and corticospinal tract fibers in the lesion, and did not increase reactive gliosis. Additionally, post-SCI administration of SWNT-PEG induced a modest improvement in hindlimb locomotor recovery without inducing hyperalgesia.

We have developed a novel formulation of magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) within PEG, and have previously demonstrated the neuroprotective benefit of this formulation in animal models of thoracic SCI. Twenty-two Sprague Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical hemicontusion at C4-C5 and were randomized 2 hours later to either the MgCl₂ in PEG formulation, or normal saline. Each treatment was administered in 5 intravenous infusions spaced 6 hours apart. Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks, after which the cord was analyzed to measure the extent of gray matter and white matter sparing through the injury site. In the horizontal ladder test, the percentage of forelimb errors made by the animals treated with MgCl₂ in PEG formulation was significantly lower than the saline-treated controls. Histologic analysis also revealed a significantly higher cumulative white matter sparing through the injury site in the MgCl₂ in PEG group. MgCl₂ in a PEG formulation reduced secondary damage and improved behavioral recovery when administered 2 hours after a unilateral cervical hemicontusion injury. These findings are consistent with the neurologic benefit observed when administering this magnesium formulation in contusive and compressive models of thoracic SCI. Demonstrating the robustness of this neuroprotective effect in multiple injury models (and in the cervical injury model in particular) is important when considering the applicability of such a therapy for human SCIs.","polyethylene_glycol"

However there are limits to both the concentration and the molecular weight of the application that do not permit the broadest recovery across an injured animal population. In this study, PEG-decorated silica nanoparticles (PSiNPs) sealed cells, as shown by the significantly reduced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from damaged cells compared with uncoated particles or PEG alone. Further in vivo tests showed that PSiNPs also significantly reduced the formation of reactive oxygen species and the process of lipid peroxidation of the membrane. Fabrication of PSiNPs containing embedded dyes also revealed targeting of the particles to damaged, but not undamaged, spinal cord tissues. In an in vivo crush/contusion model of guinea pig SCI, every animal but one injected with PSiNPs recovered conduction through the cord lesion, whereas none of the control animals did.

Previously, we showed that polyethylene glycol (PEG) can reseal axonal membranes following compression in isolated guinea pig spinal cord white matter. We now report that 10 mM PEG can also significantly enhance membrane resealing following transection in the clinically relevant conditions of low extracellular Ca(2+) and low temperature. Such beneficial effects were demonstrated both functionally, through membrane potential measured by double sucrose gap apparatus, and anatomically, through horseradish peroxidase and tetramethyl rhodamine dextran dye exclusion assays. We further noted that axons with small diameters preferentially benefited from PEG-mediated axolemmal resealing. Using atomic force microscopy, we further showed that PEG can effectively reduce neuronal membrane surface tension. We hypothesize that PEG may promote axolemmal resealing by increasing membrane line tension and reducing membrane tension, thus creating conditions more favorable to membrane resealing. In summary, these studies suggest that PEG is effective under the clinically relevant conditions of low Ca(2+) and temperature, and thus has the potential to be used in combination with other more established interventions in spinal cord and traumatic brain injury.","polyethylene_glycol"

Adult rats underwent 35-g clip compression SCI at C8 and were randomized postinjury to receive intravenous 30% PEG or sterile Ringer's lactate solution.

Polyethylene glycol also promoted spinal cord tissue sparing based on retrograde axonal Fluoro-Gold tracing and morphometric histological assessment. Polyethylene glycol also promoted significant, although modest, neurobehavioral recovery after SCI. Collectively, these results indicate that PEG protects key axonal cytoskeletal proteins after SCI, and that the protection is associated with axonal preservation.

Here we compared PEG-treated to untreated rats using a computer-managed open-field behavioral test subsequent to a standardized brain injury. Animals were evaluated after a 2-, 4-, and 6-hour delay in treatment after TBI. Treated animals receive a single subcutaneous injection of PEG. When treated within 2 hours of the injury, injured PEG-treated rats showed statistically significant improvement in their exploratory behavior recorded in the activity box when compared to untreated but brain-injured controls. A delay of 4 hours reduced this level of achievement, but a statistically significant improvement due to PEG injection was still clearly evident in most outcome measures compared at the various evaluation times. A further delay of 2 more hours, however, eradicated the beneficial effects of PEG injection as revealed using this behavioral assessment.

We did not observe any unacceptable clinical response to polymer injection; there were no deaths, nor any other problem arising from, or associated with, the procedures. Outcome measures over the 6-8-week trial were improved by polymer injection when compared to historical cases. This recovery was unexpectedly rapid compared to these comparator groups. The results of this pilot trial provides evidence consistent with the notion that the injection of inorganic polymers in acute neurotrauma may be a simple and useful intervention during the acute phase of the injury.","polyethylene_glycol"

We have previously demonstrated that administration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) inhibits oxidative stress using an in vitro model of SCI. In this study we tested the effects of PEG in vivo, to elucidate the mechanism of PEG-mediated neuroprotection. We show that a compression injury at T10-11 induced diffusive oxidative stress in crude synaptosomal preparations, correlated with synaptosomal dysfunction and increased intrasynaptosomal calcium. Administration of PEG immediately post-injury produced a marked decrease in synaptosomal oxidative stress and calcium, associated with an increase in synaptosomal function. Confocal microscopy using fluorescein conjugated PEG revealed that PEG entered the cells of the injured spinal cord, placing the polymer in a position to directly interact with cellular organelles. PEG attenuates calcium-induced functional compromise of normal spinal cord synaptosomes and mitochondria in vitro. These results indicate that PEG may exert its neuroprotective effect through direct interaction with mitochondria, besides its known ability to rescue neurons and their axons by repairing the plasma membranes. We submit that PEG is likely to interfere with the cascade of secondary injury by several mechanisms of action that in concert reduce oxidative stress.","polyethylene_glycol"

We report that a single subcutaneous injection of the tri-block copolymer, Poloxamer 188 (P188) 6 hr after a severe compression of the adult guinea pig spinal cord is able to: (1). preserve the anatomic integrity of the cord; (2). produce a rapid recovery of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion; and (3). produce a behavioral recovery of a spinal cord dependent long tract spinal cord reflex. These observations stood out against a control group in blinded evaluation. Conduction through the lesion was monitored by stimulating the tibial nerve of the hind limb, and measuring the arrival of evoked potentials at the contralateral sensory cortex of the brain (somatosensory evoked potentials; SSEP). Behavioral recovery was determined by a return of sensitivity of formerly areflexic receptive fields of the cutaneous trunchi muscle (CTM) reflex. This contraction of back skin in response to tactile stimulation is totally dependent on the integrity of an identified bilateral column of ascending long tract axons. A statistically significant recovery of both SSEP conduction through the lesion and the CTM reflex occurred in P188-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. Quantitative 3D computer reconstruction of the lesioned vertebral segment of spinal cord revealed a statistically significant sparing of spinal cord parenchyma and a significant reduction in cavitation of the spinal cord compared to control animals We determined that the proportion of P188-treated animals that recovered evoked potentials were nearly identical to that produced by a subcutaneous injection of polyethylene glycol (PEG). In contrast, P188 was not as effective as PEG in producing a recovery of CTM functioning. We discuss the likely differences in the mechanisms of action of these two polymers, and the possibilities inherent in a combined treatment.","polyethylene_glycol"

This involves a brief application of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the site of injury. In the companion paper, we have shown that a delayed application of PEG can produce strikingly significant physiological and behavioral recovery in 90-100 % of spinal-cord-injured guinea pigs. In the present paper, we used three-dimensional computer reconstructions of PEG-treated and sham-treated spinal cords to determine whether the pathological character of a 1-month-old injury is ameliorated by application of PEG. Using a novel isocontouring algorithm, we show that immediate PEG treatment and treatment delayed by up to 7 h post-injury statistically increased the volume of intact spinal parenchyma and reduced the amount of cystic cavitation. Furthermore, in PEG-treated animals, the lesion was more focal and less diffuse throughout the damaged segment of the spinal cord, so that control cords showed a significantly extended lesion surface area. This three-dimensional computer evaluation showed that the functional recovery produced by topical application of a hydrophilic polymer is accompanied by a reduction in spinal cord damage.","polyethylene_glycol"

Furthermore, a brief (2 min) application of the fusogen (M(r) 1800, 50 % w/v aqueous solution) to the exposed spinal cord injury in vivo can also cause rapid recovery of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion in association with functional recovery. Behavioral recovery was demonstrated using a long-tract, spinal-cord-dependent behavior in rodents known as the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) reflex. This reflex is observed as a contraction of the skin of the back in response to tactile stimulation. Here, we confirm and extend these preliminary observations. A severe compression/contusion injury to the exposed thoracic spinal cord of the guinea pig was performed between thoracic vertebrae 10 and 11. Approximately 7 h later, a topical application of PEG was made to the injury (dura removed) for 2 min in 15 experimental animals, and levels of recovery were compared with those of 13 vehicle-treated control animals. In PEG-treated animals, 93 % recovered variable levels of CTM functioning and all recovered some level of conduction through the lesion, as measured by evoked potential techniques. The recovered reflex was relatively normal compared with the quantitative characteristics of the reflex prior to injury with respect to the direction, distance and velocity of skin contraction. Only 23 % of the control population showed any spontaneous CTM recovery (P=0.0003) and none recovered conduction through the lesion during the 1 month period of observation (P=0.0001). These results suggest that repair of nerve membranes by polymeric sealing can provide a novel means for the rapid restoration of function following spinal cord injury.","polyethylene_glycol"

In most cells, this is first observed as a collapse of the axolemmas barrier properties allowing a derangement of ions to occur, leading to a progressive dissolution of the cell or its process. We have shown that an artificial sealing of mechanically damaged membranes by topical application of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) immediately restores variable levels of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion. This was documented by a rapid recovery of somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) conduction, and by recovery of the cutaneous trunchi muscle (CTM) reflex in PEG-treated animals. The CTM reflex is a sensorimotor behavior dependent on an intact (and identified) white matter tract within the ventrolateral funiculus of the spinal cord, and is thus an excellent index of white matter integrity. We show that PEG can be safely introduced into the bloodstream by several routes of administration. Using a fluorescein decorated PEG, we demonstrate that the polymer specifically targets the hemorrhagic contusion of the adult guinea pig spinal cord when administered through the vasculature, but not intact regions of the spinal cord. A single subcutaneous injection (30% weight by weight in sterile saline) made 6 hr after a standardized spinal cord contusion in adult guinea pigs was sufficient to produce a rapid recovery of SSEP propagation through the lesion in only PEG-treated animals, accompanied by a statistically significant recovery of the CTM reflex. These data suggest that parenterally administered PEG may be a novel treatment for not only spinal injury, but head injury and stroke as well.","polyethylene_glycol"

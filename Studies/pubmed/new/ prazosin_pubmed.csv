A retrospective chart review of men with SCI at or above T6, who used reflex voiding for bladder management and had upper tract stasis diagnosed by renal scan. Inclusion was based on the availability of the following tests both before and after alpha1-receptor blockade: renal scan, urodynamic studies, and arterial pressures. Part I evaluated the impact of alpha1-blockers on upper tract stasis. Part II evaluated the impact of alpha1-blockers on urodynamic parameters in those with and without resolution of stasis. Chi-square test was used to determine the statistical significance of resolution of upper tract stasis. Student's t test for 2-paired samples was used to evaluate whether urodynamic parameters differed significantly before and after treatment with alpha1-blockers. Urodynamic parameters evaluated included mean changes in opening pressure, maximum detrusor voiding pressure, and duration of uninhibited contraction. Ten men with upper tract stasis were identified (15 renal units). After >6 months on alpha1-receptor antagonist therapy, upper tract stasis resolved in 8 of the 10 men (11 renal units) and persisted in 2 men (4 renal units). (P = .00026). The only urodynamic parameter that significantly changed in those with resolution of upper tract stasis was the duration of the uninhibited contraction (resolution of stasis: -57 seconds; P < .001), persistence of stasis: +12 seconds (P < .05). No significant change in opening pressures occurred in either those with resolution of stasis or persistent stasis (P < .78). Maximum arterial pressures during voiding statistically decreased with the use of alpha1-blockers (152 mmHg vs 135 mmHg; P < .01). alpha1-Receptor-antagonist therapy improved upper tract stasis in men with SCI. The urodynamic parameter that changed in those with resolution of upper tract stasis was the duration of uninhibited contractions, which decreased significantly.","prazosin"

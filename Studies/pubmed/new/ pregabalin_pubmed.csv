While the development of novel compounds or cell-based interventions for spinal cord injury is unquestionably worthwhile, a complementary approach examines current standards of care and the degree to which these can be optimized to benefit long-term neurological function. Numerous classes of drugs, already in use in the acute phase of spinal cord injury, are intriguing because they (1) readily cross the blood-spinal cord barrier to modulate activity in the central nervous system and (2) are administered during a window of time in which neuroprotection, and even some repair, are feasible. Here, we review a rare case of convergent lines of evidence from both preclinical and human studies to support the early administration of a class of drug (ie, gabapentinoids) to both foster motor recovery and reduce the severity of neuropathic pain.","pregabalin"

We have also previously observed that anticonvulsants improve motor outcomes following human SCI. The present study examined the optimal timing and type of anticonvulsants administered in a large, prospective, multi-center, cohort study in acute SCI. Mixed-effects regression techniques were used to model total motor scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post injury. We found that early (not late) administration of anticonvulsants significantly improved motor recovery (6.25 points over 1 year). The beneficial effect of anticonvulsants remained significant after adjustment for differences in 1-month motor scores and injury characteristics. A review of a subset of patients revealed that gabapentinoids were the most frequently administrated anticonvulsant. Together with preclinical findings, intervention with anticonvulsants represents a potential pharmacological strategy to improve motor function after SCI.","pregabalin"

To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 ± 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes. Early intervention with anticonvulsants may have effects beyond pain management and warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in human SCI.","pregabalin"

Suppression of microglial activation and improvement in functional recovery was observed in experimental spinal cord injury after PGB administration. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate whether PGB could afford neuroprotection in a rat model of intracisternal facial nerve avulsion. Twenty-eight male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were dichotomized into two groups: a PGB group (N.=14) and a control group (N.=14). The PGB group received a total of 4 intraperitoneal PGB injections (30 mg/kg, 15 minutes preoperatively and 4, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively), and the control group underwent intraperitoneal saline injection. Intracisternal facial nerve avulsion was created by tangential pull-out of the nerve surgically exposed at the stylomastoid foramen. In both groups, the brainstem containing the facial motor nuclei neurons was thin-sliced and stained with cresyl violet, and the number of viable neurons in the facial motor nuclei on days 14 and 28 was counted under microscope. The total viable neuron count was significantly greater in the PGB group than in the Control group both on day 14 (271.4±14.9 vs. 196.2±22.2, P<0.01) and day 28 (160.2±21.6 vs. 102.6±13.4, P<0.01). Furthermore, CD11b/c immunostaining on days 3 and 8 showed that CD11b/c-positive cells, suggestive of activated microglia, were observed only in the control group. Better neuronal survival by PGB administration may be beneficial and clinically relevant when surgical reconstruction of the facial nerve, such as hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, is considered.","pregabalin"

In the present study, we examined their effects on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice subjected to weight-drop spinal cord injury. Hindlimb motor function and mechanical hypersensitivity were evaluated using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and the von Frey test, respectively, for 4 weeks after spinal cord injury. Despite gradual recovery of hindlimb motor function after spinal cord injury, mice exhibited continuous development of mechanical hypersensitivity. Gabapentin (30 and 100 mg/kg) and pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally on the 28th day after spinal cord injury, reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that gabapentin and pregabalin could be useful therapeutic tools for patients with neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury.","pregabalin"

The authors examined the neuroprotective effect of pregabalin (GP) which is known as to reduce glutamate secretion, in a rat model of spinal cord injury. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four groups; the control group (contusion injury only), the methylprednisolone treated group, the minocycline treated group and the GP treated group. Spinal cord injury was produced by contusion using the New York University impactor (25 g-cm, at the 9th-10th thoracic). Functional evaluations were done using the inclined plane test and a motor rating scale. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling staining technique (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining of cord tissues obtained at 7 days post-injury. Pregabalin treated animals showed significantly better functional recovery, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Mean numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the respective groups were 63.5 +/- 7.4, 53.6 +/- 4.0, 44.2 +/- 3.9 and 36.5 +/- 3.6. Double staining (TUNEL and anti-CC1) for oligodendrocyte apoptosis, was used to calculate oligodendrocyte apoptotic indexes (AI), using the following formula AI = (No. of doubly stained cells/No. of anti-CC1 positive cells) x 100. Mean group AIs were 88.6, 46.7, 82.1 and 70.3%, respectively. Mean numbers of activated microglia (anti-OX-42 positive cells) in high power fields were 29.8 +/- 3.9, 22.7 +/- 4.1, 21.0 +/- 3.9 and 17.8 +/- 4.3, respectively. This experiment demonstrates that GP can act as a neuroprotector after SCI in rats, and its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects are related to its neuroprotective effect. Further studies are needed to unveil the specific mechanism involved at the receptor level.","pregabalin"

The objective of this study was to evaluate randomized clinical trials that address potential neuroprotective agents used to improve neurological outcome in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations.","progesterone"

However, its effect and mechanism on axonal dieback at the early stage of SCI remain unclear. Here, we investigate the dynamics of injured axons and the effect of PG on the axonal dieback, glial response, and behavioral recovery in a mouse model of SCI. Two-photon intravital imaging combined with a simplified imaging window chamber were used to image axons in hemisected spinal cords over a period of 3 days. Repeated imaging showed that axonal dieback distance in mice treated with PG after SCI was significantly reduced than that in mice treated with vehicle after SCI (P < 0.05) at the time point of 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after SCI. The densities of astrocytes and microglia in the SCI-vehicle treated group were significantly higher than those in mice treated with PG after SCI (P < 0.05). Real time polymerase chain reaction assay indicated that administration of PG after SCI down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, NOS2, and IL-1β (P < 0.05). PG treatment also improved the behavioral performance post injury. These findings suggested that PG exerted a neuroprotective effect by attenuating axonal dieback, reducing the accumulation of astrocytes and microglia and inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","progesterone"

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of progesterone and vitamin D on functional outcome of patients with acute traumatic SCI. This was a randomized clinical trial including 64 adult patients with acute traumatic SCI admitted within 8 hours of injury. All the patients received methylprednisolone on admission according to standard protocol (30 mg/kg as bolus dose and 15 mg/kg each 3 hours up to 24 hours). Patients were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular injection of 0.5 mg/kg progesterone twice daily and 5µg/kg oral vitamin D3 twice daily up to 5 days (n = 32) or placebo (n = 32). Patients were visited 6 days, 3 and 6 months after injury and motor and sensory function was assessed according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score. There was no significant difference between two study groups regarding age (P = 0.341), sex (P = 0.802) and therapy lag (P = 0.609). The motor powers and sensory function increased significantly after 6 months in both study groups. Those who received progesterone and vitamin D had significantly higher motor powers and sensory function after 6 months of therapy. Those who received the therapy within 4 hours of injury, had significantly higher motor powers and sensory function 6 months after treatment in progesterone and vitamin D group. Therapy lag was negatively associated with 6-month motor powers and sensory function in progesterone and vitamin D group. Administration of progesterone and vitamin D in acute phase of traumatic SCI is associated with better functional recovery and outcome.","progesterone"

Past experimental and clinical research aimed at addressing this subject has led to constrasting findings on whether females hold any advantage in locomotor recovery. Additionally, for studies supporting the notion of a female gender related advantage, a definite cause has not been explained. In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance: age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male. By deepening our understanding of why a gender advantage exists, potential new therapeutics can be designed to improve recovery for the male population following the initial trauma or putatively augment the neuroprotective privilege in females for enhanced outcomes.","progesterone"

Evidence suggests that inflammation plays a role in both the damage and repair of injured neural tissue. We show that microglia at sites of SCI rapidly express the alarmin interleukin (IL)-1α, and that infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages subsequently produce IL-1β. Infiltration of these cells is dramatically reduced in both IL-1α(-/-) and IL-1β(-/-) mice, but only IL-1α(-/-) mice showed rapid (at day 1) and persistent improvements in locomotion associated with reduced lesion volume. Similarly, intrathecal administration of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra restored locomotor function post-SCI. Transcriptome analysis of SCI tissue at day 1 identified the survival factor Tox3 as being differentially regulated exclusively in IL-1α(-/-) mice compared with IL-1β(-/-) and wild-type mice. Accordingly, IL-1α(-/-) mice have markedly increased Tox3 levels in their oligodendrocytes, beginning at postnatal day 10 (P10) and persisting through adulthood. At P10, the spinal cord of IL-1α(-/-) mice showed a transient increase in mature oligodendrocyte numbers, coinciding with increased IL-1α expression in wild-type animals. In adult mice, IL-1α deletion is accompanied by increased oligodendrocyte survival after SCI. TOX3 overexpression in human oligodendrocytes reduced cellular death under conditions mimicking SCI. These results suggest that IL-1α-mediated Tox3 suppression during the early phase of CNS insult plays a crucial role in secondary degeneration. The mechanisms underlying bystander degeneration of neurons and oligodendrocytes after CNS injury are ill defined. We show that microglia at sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) rapidly produce the danger signal interleukin (IL)-1α, which triggers neuroinflammation and locomotor defects. We uncovered that IL-1α(-/-) mice have markedly increased levels of the survival factor Tox3 in their oligodendrocytes, which correlates with the protection of this cell population, and reduced lesion volume, resulting in unprecedented speed, level, and persistence of functional recovery after SCI. Our data suggest that central inhibition of IL-1α or Tox3 overexpression during the acute phase of a CNS insult may be an effective means for preventing the loss of neurological function in SCI, or other acute injuries such as ischemia and traumatic brain injuries.","progesterone"

Males with SCI tend to be injured at an earlier age, mostly during sports or motor vehicle accidents, whereas females tend be injured later in life, particularly in the age group 65 and older. In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females. Similar controversy exists clinically, in studies that have examined gender disparities in outcome after SCI. The current review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for a gender bias in outcome following SCI and discusses issues that have made it difficult to conclusively answer this question.","progesterone"

In peripheral neuropathies, progesterone and reduced derivatives promote remyelination, axonal regeneration and the recovery of function. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), progesterone has the ability to reduce edema and inflammatory cytokines, prevent neuronal loss and improve functional outcomes. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury. In experimental spinal cord injury (SCI), molecular markers of functional motoneurons become impaired, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, Na,K-ATPase mRNA, microtubule-associated protein 2 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). SCI also produces motoneuron chromatolysis. Progesterone treatment restores the expression of these molecules while chromatolysis subsided. SCI also causes oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination. In this case, a short progesterone treatment enhances proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into mature myelin-producing cells, whereas prolonged treatment increases a transcription factor (Olig1) needed to repair injury-induced demyelination. Progesterone neuroprotection has also been shown in motoneuron neurodegeneration. In Wobbler mice spinal cord, progesterone reverses the impaired expression of BDNF, ChAT and Na,K-ATPase, prevents vacuolar motoneuron degeneration and the development of mitochondrial abnormalities, while functionally increases muscle strength and the survival of Wobbler mice. Multiple mechanisms contribute to these progesterone effects, and the role played by classical nuclear receptors, extra nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, and the reduced metabolites of progesterone in neuroprotection and myelin formation remain an exciting field worth of exploration.","progesterone"

Baseline breathing was similarly altered in all rats (reduced VT, elevated fR) but during hypercapnia females had relatively higher VT (i.e. compared to pre-injury) than male or OVX rats (p<0.05). Phrenic neurograms recorded in anesthetized rats indicated that normalized burst amplitude recorded ipsilateral to C2HS (i.e. the crossed phrenic phenomenon) is greater in females during respiratory challenge (p<0.05 vs. male and OVX).

Its effects on the reproductive and endocrine systems are well known, but a large and growing body of evidence, including a recently published pilot clinical trial, indicates that the hormone also exerts neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system. We now know that it is produced in the brain, for the brain, by neurons and glial cells in the central and peripheral nervous system of both male and female individuals. Laboratories around the world have reported that administering relatively large doses of progesterone during the first few hours to days after injury significantly limits central nervous system damage, reduces loss of neural tissue, and improves functional recovery. Although the research published to date has focused primarily on progesterone's effects on blunt traumatic brain injury, there is evidence that the hormone affords protection from several forms of acute central nervous system injury, including penetrating brain trauma, stroke, anoxic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Progesterone appears to exert its protective effects by protecting or rebuilding the blood-brain barrier, decreasing development of cerebral edema, down-regulating the inflammatory cascade, and limiting cellular necrosis and apoptosis.

In this work, we studied PROG effects on glial cells of the normal and transected (TRX) spinal cord, to complement previous studies in motoneurons. Both neurons and glial cells expressed the classical PROG receptor (PR), suggesting that genomic mechanisms participated in PROG action. In TRX rats, PROG treatment stimulated the number of NADPH-diaphorase (nitric oxide synthase) active astrocytes, whereas the number of astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was stimulated in control but not in TRX rats. PROG also stimulated the immunocytochemical staining for myelin-basic protein (MBP) and the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells expressing the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 in TRX rats. In terms of beneficial or detrimental consequences, these PROG effects may be supportive of neuronal recuperation, as shown for several neuronal functional parameters that were normalized by PROG treatment of spinal cord injured animals.

Morphologically, motoneurons of untreated Wobbler mice showed severe vacuolation of intracellular organelles including mitochondria. In contrast, neuropathology was less pronounced in Wobbler mice receiving progesterone, together with a reduction of vacuolated cells and preservation of mitochondrial ultrastructure.

As expected, spinal cord injury reduced ChAT immunostaining intensity of ventral horn neurons. A 3-day course of intensive PROG treatment of transected rats restored ChAT immunoreactivity, as assessed by frequency histograms that recorded shifts from predominantly light neuronal staining to medium, dark or intense staining typical of control rats. Transection also reduced the expression of the mRNA for the alpha3 catalytic and beta1 regulatory subunits of neuronal Na,K-ATPase, whereas PROG treatment restored both subunit mRNA to normal levels. Additionally, the upregulation observed for GAP-43 mRNA in ventral horn neurons in spinal cord-transected rats, was further enhanced by PROG administration. In no case did PROG modify ChAT immunoreactivity, Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNA or GAP-43 mRNA in control, sham-operated rats. Further, the PROG-mediated effects on these three markers were observed in large, presumably Lamina IX motoneurons, as well as in smaller neurons measuring approximately <500 micro2. Overall, the stimulatory effects of PROG on ChAT appears to replenish acetylcholine, with its stimulatory effects on Na,K-ATPase seems capable of restoring membrane potential, ion transport and nutrient uptake. PROG effects on GAP-43 also appear to accelerate reparative responses to injury. As the cellular basis for PROG neuroprotection becomes better understood it may prove of therapeutic benefit to spinal cord injury patients.","progesterone"

Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment.

Forty mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: laminectomy with sham contusion, laminectomy with contusion without pharmacologic treatment, laminectomy with contusion treated with dimethylsulfoxide and dissolved progesterone, and laminectomy with contusion treated with dimethylsulfoxide. Functional status was assessed weekly using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan (BBB) locomotor rating scale for 6 weeks, after which the animals were killed for histologic studies. Rats treated with progesterone had better outcomes (P = 0.0017; P = 0.0172) with a BBB score of 15.5, compared with 10.0 in the dimethylsulfoxide control group and 12.0 in the spinal cord contusion without pharmacologic intervention group. This was corroborated in histologic analysis by relative sparing of white matter tissue at the epicenter of the injury in the progesterone-treated group (P < 0.05). Rats treated with progesterone had a better clinical and histologic outcome compared with the various control groups. These results indicate potential therapeutic properties of progesterone in the management of acute spinal cord injury.","progesterone"

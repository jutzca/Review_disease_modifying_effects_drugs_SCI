Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury.","red_blood_cells"

Recently, there is increasing interest in tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic drug, which can reduce the bleeding volume after physical trauma. However, the efficacy of TXA on the pathology of SCI remains unknown. After producing a contusion SCI at the thoracic level of mice, TXA was intraperitoneally administered and the bleeding volume in the lesion area was quantified. Tissue damage was evaluated by immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses. Since heme is one of the degraded products of red blood cells (RBCs) and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), we examined the influence of heme on the pathology of SCI. Functional recovery was assessed using the open field motor score, a foot print analysis, a grid walk test, and a novel kinematic analysis system. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, Dunnett's test, and an ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. After SCI, the intralesional bleeding volume was correlated with the heme content and the demyelinated area at the lesion site, which were significantly reduced by the administration of TXA. In the injured spinal cord, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is a DAMP receptor, was predominantly expressed in microglial cells. Heme stimulation increased TLR4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression levels in primary microglial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly to the in vitro experiments, the injection of non-lysed RBCs had little pathological influence on the spinal cord, whereas the injection of lysed RBCs or heme solution significantly upregulated the TLR4 and TNF expression in microglial cells. In TXA-treated SCI mice, the decreased expressions of TLR4 and TNF were observed at the lesion sites, accompanied by a significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells and better functional recovery in comparison to saline-treated control mice. The administration of TXA ameliorated the intralesional cytotoxicity both by reducing the intralesional bleeding volume and preventing heme induction of the TLR4/TNF axis in the SCI lesion. Our findings suggest that TXA treatment may be a therapeutic option for acute-phase SCI.","red_blood_cells"

The study will provide theoretical and experimental evidences for acetyl-L-carnitine's clinical treatment. Fifty-five SD rats aged 8-10 weeks were randomly divided into high, medium and low-dose drug intervention (SCI + ALC) group, injury group (SCI) and sham group for behavioral evaluation, MAD and SOD detection, as well as HPLC detection and HE staining. BBB scores and Rivlin experiments were performed to evaluate hindlimb motor function in each group. The morphology and structure of spinal cord tissue was detected by HE staining. Another 9 rats were randomly divided into Sham group, SCI group and ALC group for TUMEL detection of apoptosis. The BBB scores of the high, medium, and low dose SCI+ALC groups were significantly higher than those in the SCI group. The medium and high-dose ALC groups had significant differences (P＜0.01), and the hindlimb motor function was significantly improved in rats. The maximum tilt angle of the Rivlin experiment was observed. The SCI+ALC group had a significantly increased angle compared with the SCI group (P＜0.05), the medium and high-dose ALC group had a significant difference (P＜0.01). Compared with the SCI group, the tissue structure of ALC high-dose group was improved significantly, the number of inflammatory cells and red blood cells was decreased, and the nucleolus of the nerve cells was unclear. The SOD activity of the SCI+ALC group was significantly higher than that of the SCI group, while the MDA content was significantly decreased(P＜0.05), the middle and high dose ALC groups were significantly different (P＜0.01). HPLC chromatogram showed that the SCI+ALC fresh serum sample and the ALC standard solution had the same absorption spectrum at 260 nm, while the Sham group and SCI group serum samples did not show spectral values there, which indicated that the same substance as the standard existed in the sample of SCI+ALC group. TUNEL staining showed that the apoptosis signal was occasionally seen in the sham group, and the apoptosis signal was significantly decreased in the ALC high-dose group compared with the SCI group(P＜0.05). ALC can promote the recovery of hindlimb motor function in rats with spinal cord injury, inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis, and repair the damaged spinal cord tissue.","red_blood_cells"

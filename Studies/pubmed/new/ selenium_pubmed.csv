Thus, scavenging of ROS has emerged as an effective route to ameliorate secondary spinal cord injury. Selenium-doped carbon quantum dots (Se-CQDs) with the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species were prepared and used for efficiently ameliorating secondary injury in TSCI. Water-soluble Se-CQDs were easily synthesized via hydrothermal treatment of l-selenocystine. The chemical structure, size, and morphology of the Se-CQDs were characterized in detail. The biocompatibility and protective effects of the Se-CQDs against H2O2-induced oxidative damage were investigated in vitro. Moreover, the behavioral test, bladder function, histological observation, Western blot were used to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Se-CQDs in a rat model of contusion TSCI. The obtained Se-CQDs exhibited good biocompatibility and remarkable protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in astrocytes and PC12 cells. Moreover, Se-CQDs displayed marked anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, which thereby reduced the formation of glial scars and increased the survival of neurons with unscathed myelin sheaths in vivo. As a result, Se-CQDs were capable of largely improving locomotor function of rats with TSCI. This study suggests that Se-CQDs can be used as a promising therapeutic platform for ameliorating secondary injury in TSCI.","selenium"

It appears to contribute to the death of tumors, ischemia-reperfusion, acute renal failure, and nervous system diseases, among others. The generative mechanism of ferroptosis includes iron overloading, lipid peroxidation, and downstream execution, while the regulatory mechanism involves the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, as well as the mevalonate pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. In-depth research has continuously developed and enriched knowledge on the mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs. In recent years, reports of the noninterchangeable role played by selenium in glutathione peroxidase 4 and its function in suppressing ferroptosis and the discovery of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, identified as a ferroptosis resistance factor parallel to the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, have expanded and deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which ferroptosis works. Ferroptosis has been reported in spinal cord injury animal model experiments, and the inhibition of ferroptosis could promote the recovery of neurological function. Here, we review the latest studies on mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs, focusing on the ferroptosis execution and the contents related to selenium and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. In addition, we summarize the current research status of ferroptosis in spinal cord injury. The aim of this review is to better understand the mechanisms by which ferroptosis occurs and its role in the pathophysiological process of spinal cord injury, so as to provide a new idea and frame of reference for further exploration.","selenium"

Among the complex pathophysiological events following SCI, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction plays a particularly significant role. As therapeutic agents for neurological diseases, tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) have been widely used in the clinical treatment of SCI. Our previous studies have reported that functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) exhibit excellent antioxidant activity against oxidative stress-related diseases. Therefore, in this study, novel multifunctionalized SeNPs decorated with polysaccharide-protein complex (PTW)/PG-6 peptide and loaded with TMP/GM1 were rationally designed and synthesized, which exhibited a satisfactory size distribution and superior stability. Furthermore, the protective effects of SeNPs@GM1/TMP on PC12 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH)-induced cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms were also explored. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that SeNPs@GM1/TMP showed strongly protective effects against t-BOOH-induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we found that SeNPs@GM1/TMP could attenuate ROS overproduction to prevent mitochondria dysfunction via inhibiting the activation of p53 and MAPK pathways. Effects of SeNPs@GM1/TMP on functional recovery after SCI were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, inclined plane test, and footprint analysis. The results of hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining also showed that SeNPs@GM1/TMP provided a neuroprotective effect in SCI rats. This finding suggests that SeNPs@GM1/TMP could be further developed as a promising nanomedicine for efficient SCI treatment.","selenium"

Both neurodevelopment and the survival of neurons that are subject to stress depend on a regular selenoprotein biosynthesis and sufficient Se supply by selenoprotein P (SELENOP). Neuro-regeneration after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is related to the Se status. Single-centre prospective observational study. Three groups of patients with comparable injuries were studied; vertebral fractures without neurological impairment (n = 10, group C), patients with TSCI showing no remission (n = 9, group G0), and patients with remission developing positive abbreviated injury score (AIS) conversion within 3 months (n = 10, group G1). Serum samples were available from different time points (upon admission, and after 4, 9 and 12 h, 1 and 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months). Serum trace element concentrations were determined by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, SELENOP by ELISA, and further parameters by laboratory routine. Serum Se and SELENOP concentrations were higher on admission in the remission group (G1) as compared to G0. During the first week, both parameters remained constant in C and G0, whereas they declined significantly in the remission group. Similarly, the concentration changes between admission and 24 h were most pronounced in this group of recovering patients (G1). Binary logistic regression analysis including the delta of Se and SELENOP within the first 24 h indicated an AUC of 90.0% (CI: 67.4%-100.0%) with regards to predicting the outcome after TSCI. A Se deficit might constitute a risk factor for poor outcome after TSCI. A dynamic decline of serum Se and SELENOP concentrations after admission may reflect ongoing repair processes that are associated with higher odds for a positive clinical outcome.","selenium"

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of ebselen on mitochondrial oxidative stress response, mitochondrial apotosis, and motor behaviors after spinal cord injury (SCI). We found that ebselen significantly increased the BBB score in motor behavior, thus suggesting a rescue effect of ebselen on motor function after SCI in rats. Meanwhile, we revealed that ebselen can increase glutathione (GSH) content as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities after SCI-this suggests ebselen has an antioxidant effect. Furthermore, the ATP content and Na+-K+-ATPase activity in mitochondria were increased by ebselen after SCI, while the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was decreased by ebselen. The Cytochrome C and Smac release from mitochondria were reduced by ebselen after SCI, thus indicating improved membrane permeability by ebselen. Moreover, the alterations in caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression, as well as the proportion of cell apoptosis were improved by ebselen treatment, which together suggested that ebselen has an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial apotosis pathways after SCI. Taken together, our results suggest that ebselen can inhibit secondary damage caused by spinal cord injury. Indeed it plays a neuroprotective role in spinal cord injury perhaps by improving mitochondrial function and inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.","selenium"

This model is unique in that the impairment is limited to the tail: the subjects do not experience limb weakness, bladder impairment, or bowel dysfunction. In addition, 4 of the 6 subjects received a combination treatment comprising thyrotropin releasing hormone, selenium, and vitamin E after induction of experimental TSCI. The subjects tolerated the implantation of the recording device and did not experience adverse effects due the medications administered. The EMG data were transformed into a metric of volitional tail moment, which appeared to be valid measure of initial impairment and subsequent natural or treatment-related recovery. The histopathologic assessment demonstrated widespread axon loss at the site of injury and areas cephalad and caudad. Histopathology revealed evidence of continuing inflammation, with macrophage activation. The EMG data did not demonstrate evidence of a statistically significant treatment effect.","selenium"

Dietary selenium supplementation, provided as selenized yeast added to normal rat chow, resulted in a doubling of selenium levels in the spinal cord. Dietary selenium reduced the time required for recovery of bladder function following thoracic spinal cord injury.

Currently, selenium-enriched products have an obvious role in the protection and recovery of SCI; however, its protective mechanism is still unclear. In order to explore the protective effect of selenium-enriched supplement (SES) on SCI, the adult rats were randomly divided into sham operation control (SC) group, ischemia-reperfusion model (IM) group and SES pretreatment (ST) group to investigate the change of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and its receptor-alpha (CNTF-Ralpha) during SCI in the presence of SES. The rats in IM and ST groups were subjected to the blockage of their abdominal aorta to establish the model of SCI; but the rats in SC group were subjected to sham operation without the blockage of abdominal aorta. The rats in ST group were fed with foods containing SES at the dose of equivalent 5 mg/L selenium in water before blocking their abdominal aorta. After 7 days, the rats were sacrificed to observe the structure of nerve cells through HE staining and the expression of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha by Western blot, immunohistochemical, and RT-PCR methods, respectively. Both protein and mRNA of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha were positively expressed in rats from SC group. The mRNA expression levels of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha in ST group were much higher than SCI model group. SES can execute a protective role in SCI through up-regulating the expression of CNTF and CNTF-Ralpha.","selenium"

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model. Its efficacy may facilitate the development of novel drug targets for the treatment of SCI.","selenium"

Among the earliest biochemical reactions are hydrolysis of fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, production of biologically active eicosanoids, and peroxidation of lipids. This study examines the effect of agents purported to improve recovery following spinal cord trauma, methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) and the combination of alpha-tocopherol and selenium (Se), on the posttraumatic alterations of membrane lipid metabolism. Pretreatment with either MPSS or alpha-tocopherol and Se reduced the trauma-induced release of total FFA including arachidonate in the injured spinal cord tissue. In addition, these agents decreased the postinjury levels of prostanoids. Pretreatment with either MPSS or alpha-tocopherol and Se also completely prevented the trauma-induced loss of cholesterol while inhibiting the increase of a cholesterol peroxidation product, 25-hydroxycholesterol. These data suggest that: perturbation of membrane lipid metabolism may contribute to the tissue necrosis and functional deficit of spinal cord injury and MPSS or the combination of alpha-tocopherol and Se may protect injured spinal cord tissue, at least in part, by limiting these posttraumatic membrane lipid changes.","selenium"

Signaling initiated by the membrane receptor CD47 antagonizes vasodilation and angiogenesis by inhibiting synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). We recently found that deletion of CD47 led to significant functional locomotor improvements, enhanced angiogenesis, and increased epicenter microvascular perfusion in mice after moderate contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). We tested the hypothesis that improving NO/cGMP signaling within the spinal cord immediately after injury would increase microvascular perfusion, angiogenesis, and functional recovery, with an acute, 7-day administration of the cGMP phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil. PDE5 expression is localized within spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. While PDE5 antagonism has been shown to increase angiogenesis in a rat embolic stroke model, sildenafil had no significant effect on angiogenesis at 7 days post-injury after murine contusive SCI. Sildenafil treatment increased cGMP concentrations within the spinal cord and improved epicenter microvascular perfusion. Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) and Treadscan analyses revealed that sildenafil treatment had no functional consequence on hindlimb locomotor recovery. These data support the hypothesis that acutely improving microvascular perfusion within the injury epicenter by itself is an insufficient strategy for improving functional deficits following contusive SCI.","sildenafil"

Analysis of literature on oral PDE5 inhibitors in individuals with SCI and ED in order to evaluate how much their release changed the management of ED in SCI subjects and what remains to be seen of their potential or limits. Questionnaires on sexual function. 18 internationally published clinical studies that enrolled SCI males treated with at least one of the PDE5 inhibitors were analyzed. The small numbers of papers with large and diverse outcome measures did not consent a meta-analysis of treatment results. 705 used sildenafil, 305 vardenafil and 224 tadalafil. Median age was less than 40 years. Only 1 study excluded tetraplegic individuals. For measures of ED evaluated, 11 out of 13 studies reported a significant statistical improvement with PDE5 inhibitors versus placebo or erectile baseline (P < 0.01, or p < 0.005). The most frequent predicable factor for the therapeutic success of PDE5 inhibitors was upper motoneuron lesion. Statistical impact on ejaculation success rates was shown in at least one paper for all PDE5 inhibitors (p < 0.05). Overall, 15 patients, (7 using sildenafil), discontinued the therapies due to drawbacks. Only 1 sildenafil study reported a follow-up maximum of 24 months. Literature suggests that all oral PDE5 inhibitors represent a safe and effective treatment option for ED caused by SCI. Further research is needed on head-to-head comparative trials and SCI patient preference for these drugs; their impact on ejaculation and orgasm function, their early use after SCI for increasing the recovery rate of a spontaneous erection, and their effectiveness and tolerability in the long-term are still to be investigated.","sildenafil"

Critical review of literature on the multiple aspects of sexual rehabilitation in women with spinal cord injury (SCI) from initial recovery to long-term follow-up. Neuro-urology Department. Studies on sexuality selected from PubMed from 1993 to 2009. Literature supported by significant statistical analyses reports that females with complete tetraglegia deserved special attention immediately at initial recovery; sexual intercourse is much more difficult for them (as compared with other women with SCI) mainly because of autonomic dysreflexia and urinary incontinence. There are sparse data on predictable factors favoring sexual rehabilitation such as the age SCI was incurred, the importance of one's sexual orientation, and the SCI etiology. Information after initial discharge is based chiefly on questionnaires, which report that as more time passes since the injury, patients attain more sexual satisfaction compared with recently injured women. Studies on neurological changes after SCI, and their effect on sexual response, are supported by a significant statistical analysis, but with few SCI patients. One topic reported the effect of sildenafil on sexuality, without benefit. No paper offers any detailed analysis on the sexual impact of medical and psychological treatments related to SCI. Literature reports that some co-morbidities are more prevalent in women with SCI compared with able-bodied women but data on sexual functioning are missing. To improve sexual rehabilitation services, sexual issues and response require evaluation during periodical check-ups using validated questionnaires administered by a physician 'guide' who coordinates professional operators thus providing personalized programmable interventions.","sildenafil"

To date, systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) have shown promise in SCI. However, systemic immunosuppression can have detrimental side effects. Therefore, immunomodulatory approaches including the use of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) could represent an attractive alternative. While emerging preclinical data suggests that hIgG is neuroprotective after SCI, the optimal time window of administration and the mechanism of action remain incompletely understood. These knowledge gaps were the focus of this research study. Female adult Wistar rats received a clip compression-contusion SCI at the C7/T1 level of the spinal cord. Injured rats were randomized, in a blinded manner, to receive a single intravenous bolus of hIgG (2 g/kg) or control buffer at 15 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) or 4 h post-SCI. At 24 h and 8 weeks post-SCI, molecular, histological and neurobehavioral analyses were undertaken. At all 3 administration time points, hIgG (2 g/kg) resulted in significantly better short-term and long-term outcomes as compared to control buffer. No significant differences were observed when comparing outcomes between the different time points of administration. At 24 h post-injury, hIgG (2 g/kg) administration enhanced the integrity of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) by increasing expression of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory enzyme expression. Improvements in BSCB integrity were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, lower amounts of albumin and Evans Blue in the injured spinal cord and greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hIgG (2 g/kg) increased expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. After hIgG (2 g/kg) treatment, there were more neutrophils in the spleen and fewer neutrophils in the blood. hIgG also co-localized with endothelial cell ligands that mediate neutrophil extravasation into the injured spinal cord. Importantly, short-term effects of delayed hIgG (2 g/kg) administration were associated with enhanced tissue and neuron preservation, as well as neurobehavioral and sensory recovery at 8 weeks post-SCI. hIgG (2 g/kg) shows promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. The anti-inflammatory effects mediated by hIgG (2 g/kg) in the injured spinal cord might be explained in twofold. First, hIgG might antagonize neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord by co-localizing with endothelial cell ligands that mediate various steps in neutrophil extravasation. Second, hIgG could traffic neutrophils towards the spleen by increasing expression of neutrophil chemoattractants in the spleen and sera. Overall, we demonstrate that delayed administration of hIgG (2 g/kg) at 1 and 4-h post-injury enhances short-term and long-term benefits after SCI by modulating local and systemic neuroinflammatory cascades.","sodium"

Protection of both the function and integrity of endothelial cells as well as the prevention of BSCB disruption may be a strong strategy for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) cases. Sodium Tanshinone IIA silate (STS) is used for the treatment of coronary heart disease and improves microcirculation. Whether STS exhibits protective effects for SCI microcirculation is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects of STS on oxygen-glucose deprivation- (OGD-) induced injury of spinal cord endothelial cells (SCMECs) in vitro and to explore effects on BSCB and neurovascular protection in vivo. SCMECs were treated with various concentrations of STS (1 μM, 3 μM, and 10 μM) for 24 h with or without OGD-induction. Cell viability, tube formation, migration, and expression of Notch signaling pathway components were evaluated. Histopathological evaluation (H&E), Nissl staining, BSCB permeability, and the expression levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), CD31, NeuN, and Notch signaling pathway components were analyzed. STS was found to improve SCMEC functions and reduce inflammatory mediators after OGD. STS also relieved histopathological damage, increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), inhibited BSCB permeability, rescued microvessels, protected motor neuromas, and improved functional recovery in a SCI model. Moreover, we uncovered that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role during these processes. These results indicated that STS protects microcirculation in SCI, which may be used as a therapeutic strategy for SCI in the future.","sodium"

In vivo and in vitro experiments were carried out in this research to determine the effects of SAAS on tissue damage, neuron survival, microglia polarization, and inflammation after spinal cord injury (SCI). Differentially expressed genes treated with SAAS were screened by transcriptome sequencing, and the molecular mechanism was investigated simultaneously. The results revealed that SAAS could promote type M2 polarization of microglia and reduce the proportion of type M1. In this way, it reduced the secretion and expression of inflammatory factors. Compared with Lipopolysaccharides(LPS), 345 genes were upregulated and 407 genes were downregulated in the LPS + SAAS treatment group. In the SAAS group, expression levels of Ndufa12, IL-6, TNF-α, and Vdac1 were significantly reduced, while a marked elevation was found in MIP2. In addition, results found in an animal model showed that SAAS could obviously facilitate motor function recovery of mice after spinal cord injury, and it had a good protective effect on spinal cord tissue and neuron cells. As a result, the present study clarified both the protective effect of SAAS on neurons after spinal cord injury and the anti-inflammatory effect of microglia, which is expected to serve as a theoretical basis for clinical treatment.","sodium"

Group C also received methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) after 3 h of injury. The control group (group A) did not receive corticoids or stem cells. Voiding and motor performance evaluations were performed daily for 90 days post-transplantation. Cells were labeled with PKH26 or PKH67 for in vitro monitoring. For in vivo screening, the cells were evaluated for bioluminescence. The levels of some cytokines were quantified in different times. Euthanasia was performed 90 days post-transplant. β-tubulin III expression was evaluated in the spinal cord of the animals from all groups. As a result, we observed a recovery of 66.6 % and 61.9 % in urinary continence of animals from groups B and C, respectively. Partial recovery of motor was observed in 23.8 % and 19 % of the animals from groups B and C, respectively. Cells remained viable at the site up to 90 days after transplantation. No significant difference was observed in levels of cytokines and thickness of urinary bladders between groups. A smaller percentage of tissue injury and higher concentrations of neuropils were observed in the spinal cords of the animals from groups B and C than control group. Thus, hADSCs transplantation with or without MPSS, contributed to the improvement in voiding and motor performance of Wistar rats submitted to compressive spinal cord injury.","sodium"

Prior research has shown that nociceptive input can increase cell death, expand the area of hemorrhage, and impair long-term recovery. The current study shows that these adverse effects can be blocked by the sodium channel blocker lidocaine applied rostral to a contusion injury. Rats received a lower thoracic (T12) contusion injury, and noxious electrical stimulation (shock) was applied to the tail 24 h later. Immediately before shock treatment, a pharmacological transection was performed by slowly infusing lidocaine at T2. Long-term locomotor recovery was assessed over the next 21 days. Noxious electrical stimulation impaired locomotor recovery, and this effect was blocked by rostral lidocaine. Next, the acute effect of lidocaine was assessed. Tissue was collected 3 h after noxious stimulation, and the extent of hemorrhage was evaluated by assessing hemoglobin content using Western blotting. Nociceptive stimulation increased the extent of hemorrhage. Lidocaine applied at T2 before, but not immediately after, stimulation blocked this effect. A similar pattern of results was observed when lidocaine was applied at the site of injury by means of a lumbar puncture. The results show that a pharmacological transection blocks nociception-induced hemorrhage and exacerbation of locomotor deficits.","sodium"

Thus we investigated the use of exogenous ketone supplementation (ketone sodium, KS) combined with ketogenic diet as a means rapidly inducing a metabolic state of ketosis following spinal cord injury in adult rats. In uninjured rats, ketone levels increased more rapidly than those in rats with KD alone and peaked at higher levels than we previously demonstrated for the KD in models of spinal cord injury. However, ketone levels in KD + KS treated rats with SCI did not exceed the previously observed levels in rats treated with KD alone. We still demonstrated neuroprotective effects of KD + KS treatment that extend our previous neuroprotective observations with KD only. The results showed increased neuronal and axonal sparing in the dorsal corticospinal tract. Also, better performance of forelimb motor abilities were observed on the Montoya staircase (for testing food pellets reaching) at 4 and 6 weeks post-injury and rearing in a cylinder (for testing forelimb usage) at 6 and 8 weeks post-injury. Taken together, the findings of this study add to the growing body of work demonstrating the potential benefits of inducing ketosis following neurotrauma.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of SP in reducing inflammatory process associated to neurological disorders. We performed both in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease, induced by oligomeric Aβ1-42 stimulation, and in in vivo model of spinal cord injury (SCI) in which neuroinflammation plays a crucial role. For in vitro model, the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was first differentiated with retinoic acid (100 μM) for 24 h and then stimulated by oligomeric Aβ1-42 (1 μg/ml) and treated with SP at 0.1- 1-10 μM concentrations for another 24 h. Instead, the in vivo model of SCI was induced by extradural compression of the spinal cord at T6-T8 levels, and animals were treated with SP (10-30-100 mg/kg o.s) 1 and 6 h after SCI. Our results demonstrated that both in in vitro neuroinflammatory model and in vivo model of SCI the treatment with SP significantly reduced NF-κB nuclear translocation and IκBα degradation, as well as decreases COX-2 and iNOS expressions evaluated by Western blot analysis. Moreover, we showed that SP treatment significantly ameliorated histopathology changes and improved motor recovery in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that SP possesses neuroprotective effects, suggesting it could represent a target for therapeutic intervention in neuroinflammatory disorders.","sodium"

Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPCs) transplantation provides therapeutic benefits for neural repair in SCI, and glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been uncovered to have capability of stimulating axonal regeneration and remyelination after SCI. In this study, to evaluate whether GDNF would augment therapeutic effects of NSPCs for SCI, GDNF-encoding or mock adenoviral vector-transduced human NSPCs (GDNF-or Mock-hNSPCs) were transplanted into the injured thoracic spinal cords of rats at 7 days after SCI. Grafted GDNFhNSPCs showed robust engraftment, long-term survival, an extensive distribution, and increased differentiation into neurons and oligodendroglial cells. Compared with Mock-hNSPC- and vehicle-injected groups, transplantation of GDNF-hNSPCs significantly reduced lesion volume and glial scar formation, promoted neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration and myelination, increased Schwann cell migration that contributed to the myelin repair, and improved locomotor recovery. In addition, tract tracing demonstrated that transplantation of GDNF-hNSPCs reduced significantly axonal dieback of the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST), and increased the levels of dCST collaterals, propriospinal neurons (PSNs), and contacts between dCST collaterals and PSNs in the cervical enlargement over that of the controls. Finally grafted GDNF-hNSPCs substantially reversed the increased expression of voltage-gated sodium channels and neuropeptide Y, and elevated expression of GABA in the injured spinal cord, which are involved in the attenuation of neuropathic pain after SCI. These findings suggest that implantation of GDNF-hNSPCs enhances therapeutic efficiency of hNSPCs-based cell therapy for SCI.","sodium"

It was hypothesized that inhibition of Eph signaling promotes cellular and behavioral recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: Lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury was performed on wildtype (WT) and EphA6 knockout (KO) mice. EphA6-Fc, Ephrin-A5-Fc fusion proteins, and sodium orthovanadate were used to alter the signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry and tissue explants revealed cellular changes. Rotarod tests demonstrated vestibulomotor function. Outcomes: The EphA6 receptor expression is upregulated following LFP. Uninjured EphA6 KO mice exhibit greater neurite density and clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc causes growth cone collapse in vitro. After LFP, EphA6 KO mice demonstrate longer neurites and decreased neuronal cell death and astrocytosis compared to WT mice. Blocking EphA signaling by soluble EphA6-Fc fusion protein reduces cell death and improves motor function following LFP whereas clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc exacerbates cell death and neurodegeneration. Sodium orthovanadate rescues growth cone collapse in vitro as well as cell death and neurodegeneration in vivo. Conclusions: Eph/Ephrin signaling plays an inhibitory role following TBI. Targeting the Eph signaling pathway with Fc fusion proteins and pharmacological agents can be a novel strategy to counter the damaging effects of TBI.

The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes.","sodium"

We found that the bFGF-CRS scaffolds had proper mechanical properties for spinal cord regeneration and could slowly release bFGF for up to 6 weeks under the physiological condition. After implantation, the bFGF-CRS scaffolds could reduce microglial activation, promote revascularization, elicit endogenous neurogenesis and promote regrowth of transected axons.

Recent experimental evidence has suggested potential therapeutic applications for butyrate, including its utility in treating metabolic and inflammatory diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of SB in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and its possible mechanism of action. SCI was induced by extradural compression for 1 min of the spinal cord at the T6-7 level using an aneurysm clip, and SB (10-30-100 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1 and 6 h after SCI. For locomotor activity, study mice were treated with SB once daily for 10 days. Morphological examination was performed by light microscopy through hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. In addition, NF-κB, IκB-α, COX-2, and iNOS expressions were assayed by western blot analysis and IL-1β and TNF-α levels by immunohistochemistry analysis. The results showed that SB treatment significantly ameliorated histopathology changes and improved recovery of motor function changes in spinal cord injury in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that SB modulated the NF-κB pathway showing a significant reduction in cytokine expression. Thus, this study showed that SB exerts neuroprotective effects anti-inflammatory properties following spinal cord injury suggesting that SB may serve as a potential candidate for future treatment of spinal cord injury.","sodium"

Angiopoietins (ANGPTs) are vascular growth factors that play an important role in vascular stabilization. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase is one of the key determinants of vascular endothelium disruption/destabilization and affects angiopoietins expression after spinal cord injury. To test this, tubule formation and angiopoietins expression were assessed in endothelial cells exposed to different concentrations of recombinant neutropil elastase. Then, the expression of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and neutrophil elastase was determined at 3 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in a clinically relevant model of moderate compression (35 g for 5 min at T10) spinal cord injury. A dichotomy between the levels of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 was observed; thus, we utilized a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (sivelestat sodium; 30 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) after spinal cord injury. The expression levels of neutropil elastase and angiopoietin-2 increased, and that of angiopoietin-1 decreased after spinal cord injury in rats. The sivelestat regimen, optimized via a pharmacokinetics study, had potent effects on vascular stabilization by upregulating angiopoietin-1 via the AKT pathway and preventing tight junction protein degradation. Moreover, sivelestat attenuated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after spinal cord injury and hence subsequently alleviated secondary damage observed as a reduction in glial scar formation and the promotion of blood vessel formation and stabilization. As a result, hindlimb locomotor function significantly recovered in the sivelestat-treated animals as determined by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and footprint analyses. Furthermore, sivelestat treatment attenuated neuropathic pain as assessed by responses to von Frey filaments after spinal cord injury. Thus, our result suggests that inhibiting neutropil elastase by administration of sivelestat is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit glial scar and promote functional recovery by upregulating angiopoietin-1 after spinal cord injury.","sodium"

A systematic search was performed in PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library for literature published between January 1956 and June 17, 2015. Included studies were critically appraised, and Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods were used to determine the overall quality of evidence for primary outcomes. Previous systematic reviews on this topic were collated and evaluated using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews scoring system. The search yielded 723 citations, 13 of which satisfied inclusion criteria. Among these, 6 were primary research articles and 7 were previous systematic reviews. Based on the included research articles, there was moderate evidence that the 24-hour NASCIS II (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies) MPSS regimen has no impact on long-term neurological recovery when all postinjury time points are considered. However, there is also moderate evidence that subjects receiving the same MPSS regimen within 8 hours of injury achieve an additional 3.2 points (95% confidence interval = 0.10 to 6.33; P = .04) of motor recovery compared with patients receiving placebo or no treatment. Although safe to administer, a 24-hour NASCIS II MPSS regimen, when all postinjury time points are considered, has no impact on indices of long-term neurological recovery. When commenced within 8 hours of injury, however, a high-dose 24-hour regimen of MPSS confers a small positive benefit on long-term motor recovery and should be considered a treatment option for patients with SCI.","sodium"

MPSS treatment became the standard of care in adults despite a lack of evidence supporting clinical benefit. More recently, new guidelines from neurological surgeon groups recommended no longer using MPSS for ASCI, due to questionable clinical benefit and known complications. However, little information exists in the pediatric population regarding MPSS use in the setting of ASCI. The aim of this paper was to describe steroid use and side effects in patients with ASCI at the authors' Level 1 pediatric trauma center in order to inform other hospitals that may still use this therapy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine adherence in ordering and delivery according to the guideline of the authors' institution and to determine types and frequency of complications. Inclusion criteria included age < 17 years, blunt trauma, physician concern for ASCI, and admission for ≥ 24 hours or treatment with high-dose intravenous MPSS. Exclusion criteria included penetrating trauma, no documentation of ASCI, and incomplete medical records. Charts were reviewed for a predetermined list of complications. RESULTS A total of 602 patient charts were reviewed; 354 patients were included in the study. MPSS was administered in 59 cases. In 34 (57.5%) the order was placed correctly. In 13 (38.2%) of these 34 cases, MPSS was administered according to the recommended timeline protocol. Overall, only 13 (22%) of 59 patients received the therapy according to protocol with regard to accurate ordering and administration. Among the patients with ASCI, 20 (55.6%) of the 36 who received steroids had complications, which was a significantly higher rate than in those who did not receive steroids (8 [24.2%] of 33, p = 0.008). Among the patients without ASCI, 10 (43.5%) of the 23 who received steroids also experienced significantly more complications than patients who did not receive steroids (50 [19.1%] of 262, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS High-dose MPSS for ASCI was not delivered to pediatric patients according to protocol with a high degree of reliability. Patients receiving steroids for pediatric ASCI were significantly more likely to experience complications than patients not receiving steroids. The findings presented, including complications of steroid use, support removal of high-dose MPSS as a treatment option for pediatric ASCI.","sodium"

However, the role of the α2Na+/K+-ATPase in contusion injury to the spinal cord remains unknown. We used mice heterozygous mice for the loss-of-function disease-mutation G301R in the Atp1a2 gene (α 2+/G301R ) to study the effect of reduced α2Na+/K+-ATPase expression in a moderate contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) model. We found that α 2+/G301R mice display significantly improved functional recovery and decreased lesion volume compared to littermate controls (α 2+/+ ) 7 days after SCI. The protein level of the α1 isoform was significantly increased, in contrast to the α3 isoform that significantly decreased 3 days after SCI in both α 2+/G301R and α 2+/+ mice. The level of the α2 isoform was significantly decreased in α 2+/G301R mice both under naïve conditions and 3 days after SCI compared to α 2+/+ mice.

However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling in the spinal cord.

The levels of markers for oxidative metabolism (3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl) and inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were also measured. At 7 days post-treatment, hindlimb movement had improved in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; however, subjects in the groups treated with MPSS exhibited gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed fewer hemorrhages and lesser microglial infiltration in the AD-MSCs group. The green fluorescent protein-expressing AD-MSCs were clearly detected in the lung, spleen, and injured spinal cord; however, these cells were not detected in the liver and un-injured spinal cord. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine were decreased in the MPSS and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups; 4-hydroxynenonal and cyclooxygenase-2 levels were decreased in all treatment groups; and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator transcription 3 levels were decreased in the AD-MSCs and AD-MSCs + MPSS groups. Our results suggest that early intravenous injection of AD-MSCs after acute SCI may prevent further damage through enhancement of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, without inducing adverse effects. Additionally, this treatment could also be used as an alternative intravenous treatment modality for acute SCI.","sodium"

Although a variety of somatic cells have been tried for iPSC generation, it is still of great interest to test new cell types, especially those which are hardly obtainable in a normal situation. In this study, we generated iPSCs by using the cells originated from intervertebral disc which were removed during a spinal operation after spinal cord injury. We investigated the pluripotency of disc cell-derived iPSCs (diPSCs) and neural differentiation capability as well as therapeutic effect in spinal cord injury. The diPSCs displayed similar characteristics to human embryonic stem cells and were efficiently differentiated into neural precursor cells (NPCs) with the capability of differentiation into mature neurons in vitro. When the diPSC-derived NPCs were transplanted into mice 9 days after spinal cord injury, we detected a significant amelioration of hindlimb dysfunction during follow-up recovery periods. Histological analysis at 5 weeks after transplantation identified undifferentiated human NPCs (Nestin(+)) as well as early (Tuj1(+)) and mature (MAP2(+)) neurons derived from the transplanted NPCs. Furthermore, NPC transplantation demonstrated a preventive effect on spinal cord degeneration resulting from the secondary injury. This study revealed that intervertebral discs removed during surgery for spinal stabilization after spinal cord injury, previously considered a ""waste"" tissue, may provide a unique opportunity to study iPSCs derived from difficult-to-access somatic cells and a useful therapeutic resource for autologous cell replacement therapy in spinal cord injury.","sodium"

To date, effective therapies for SCI have not been established. With recent progress in neurobiology, however, there is hope that drug administration could improve outcomes after SCI. Riluzole is a benzothiazole anticonvulsant with neuroprotective effects. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a safe and well-tolerated treatment for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The mechanism of action of riluzole involves the inhibition of pathologic glutamatergic transmission in synapses of neurons via sodium channel blockade. There is convincing evidence that riluzole diminishes neurological tissue destruction and promotes functional recovery in animal SCI models. Based on these results, a phase I/IIa clinical trial with riluzole was conducted for patients with SCI between 2010 and 2011. This trial demonstrated significant improvement in neurological outcomes and showed it to be a safe drug with no serious adverse effects. Currently, an international, multi-center clinical trial (Riluzole in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study: RISCIS) in phase II/III is in progress with riluzole for patients with SCI (clinicaltrials.gov, registration number NCT01597518).

Axons spared from the initial injury may later undergo secondary axonal degeneration. Lack of growth cone formation, regeneration, and loss of additional myelinated axonal projections within the spinal cord greatly limits neurological recovery following injury. To assess how central myelinated axons of the spinal cord respond to injury, we developed an ex vivo living spinal cord model utilizing transgenic mice that express yellow fluorescent protein in axons and a focal and highly reproducible laser-induced spinal cord injury to document the fate of axons and myelin (lipophilic fluorescent dye Nile Red) over time using two-photon excitation time-lapse microscopy. Dynamic processes such as acute axonal injury, axonal retraction, and myelin degeneration are best studied in real-time. However, the non-focal nature of contusion-based injuries and movement artifacts encountered during in vivo spinal cord imaging make differentiating primary and secondary axonal injury responses using high resolution microscopy challenging. The ex vivo spinal cord model described here mimics several aspects of clinically relevant contusion/compression-induced axonal pathologies including axonal swelling, spheroid formation, axonal transection, and peri-axonal swelling providing a useful model to study these dynamic processes in real-time. Major advantages of this model are excellent spatiotemporal resolution that allows differentiation between the primary insult that directly injures axons and secondary injury mechanisms; controlled infusion of reagents directly to the perfusate bathing the cord; precise alterations of the environmental milieu (e.g., calcium, sodium ions, known contributors to axonal injury, but near impossible to manipulate in vivo); and murine models also offer an advantage as they provide an opportunity to visualize and manipulate genetically identified cell populations and subcellular structures. Here, we describe how to isolate and image the living spinal cord from mice to capture dynamics of acute axonal injury.","sodium"

First, neuronal function after SCI was evaluated with Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) and the result showed that injured animals treated with apigenin showed a significant increase in BBB scores. To explore the underlying mechanism, antioxidative effect of apigenin was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities after SCI. Apigenin treatment reversed the decrease of SOD and GSH-Px activity, and the increase of MDA level caused by SCI, suggesting its antioxidative role in response to the injury. In addition, apigenin treatment decreased serum interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 release after SCI, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin.

Chronic intrathecal infusion of NG2-Ab improved the following deficits induced by chronic midthoracic lateral hemisection (HX) injury: (1) synaptic transmission to lumbar motoneurons, (2) retrograde transport of fluororuby anatomical tracer from L5 to L1, and (3) locomotor function assessed by automated CatWalk gait analysis. We collected data in an attempt to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the NG2-Ab-induced improvement of synaptic transmission in HX-injured spinal cord. These data showed the following: (1) that chronic NG2-Ab infusion improved conduction and axonal excitability in chronically HX-injured rats, (2) that antibody treatment increased the density of serotonergic axons with ventral regions of spinal segments L1-L5, (3) and that NG2-positive processes contact nodes of Ranvier within the nodal gap at the location of nodal Na(+) channels, which are known to be critical for propagation of action potentials along axons.

At 12 h, 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after surgery, animals were assessed on the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and then were sacrificed. In the injury group, Bcl-2 immunoreactive cells peaked at 3 days after surgery, and the expression level returned to normal level at 14 days. In the co-transplantation group, Bcl-2 immunoreactive cells in the spinal cord-transected segments were significantly increased until 7 days (p < 0.05) and remained at this level for more than 14 days. In the injury group, the number of apoptotic cells was the highest, as compared with the other 3 groups, and peaked at 1 and 7 days following spinal cord injury, and they were mostly distributed in the white matter. The BBB scores were significantly higher in the Schwann cells-alginic acid sodium hydrogel transplantation group than in the simple injury and Schwann cell groups (p < 0.05). Schwann cells-alginic acid sodium hydrogel co-transplantation could inhibit cellular apoptosis and enhance Bcl-2 expression in the spinal cord-transected segments, and thereby promote the recovery of locomotor function after spinal cord injury, although it did not reach full rehabilitation.","sodium"

The main aim of the current study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of curcumin on lipid peroxidation (LPO), neurological function, and ultrastructural findings after SCI. Forty adult Wistar albino rats were randomized into five groups: control, SCI alone (50 g/cm weight drop), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) (30 mg/kg), curcumin + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (300 mg/kg), and DMSO alone (0.1 mg/kg). Administration of curcumin significantly decreased LPO in first 24 hours. However, there were no differences in the neurological scores of injured rats between the medication groups and the control group. Curcumin was more effective than DMSO and MPSS in reducing LPO, whereas DMSO was more effective than curcumin and MPSS in minimizing ultrastuctural changes. The results of this study indicate that curcumin exerts a beneficial effect by decreasing LPO and may reduce tissue damage. Since ultrastructural and neurological findings does not support biochemical finding, our findings do not exclude the possibility that curcumin has a protective effect on the spinal cord ultrastructure and neurological recovery after SCI. A combination of curcumin with other vehicle may also have a considerable synergy in protecting spinal cord.","sodium"

We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and previously published reviews. All randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. One review author extracted data from trial reports. Japanese and French studies were found through NASCIS and additional data (e.g. SDs) were obtained from the original study authors. Eight trials are included in this review, seven used methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post-injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg over 15 minutes, with maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial results were replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data was obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This indicated significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy, when administration commenced within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that, if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status are observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries. A modified regimen was found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. The risk of bias was low in the largest methyprednisolne trials. Overall, there was no evidence of significantly increased complications or mortality from the 23 or 48 hour therapy. High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. One trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. There is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacologic therapy for acute spinal cord injury.","sodium"

Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined.","sodium"

Secondary damage after traumatic SCI contributes to the exacerbation of cellular insult and thereby contributes to spinal cord dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Acidosis is commonly involved in the secondary injury process after the injury of central nervous system, but whether ASIC1a is involved in secondary injury after SCI is unclear. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal contusion using a weight-drop injury approach. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were used to observe the change of ASIC1a expression after SCI. The TUNEL staining in vivo as well as the cell viability and death assays in spinal neuronal culture were employed to assess the role of ASIC1a in the secondary spinal neuronal injury. The electrophysiological recording and Ca(2+) imaging were performed to reveal the possible underlying mechanism. The antagonists and antisense oligonucleotide for ASIC1a, lesion volume assessment assay and behavior test were used to estimate the therapeutic effect of ASIC1a on SCI. We show that ASIC1a expression is markedly increased in the peri-injury zone after traumatic SCI. Consistent with the change of ASIC1a expression in injured spinal neurons, both ASIC1a-mediated whole-cell currents and ASIC1a-mediated Ca(2+) entry are significantly enhanced after injury. We also show that increased activity of ASIC1a contributes to SCI-induced neuronal death. Importantly, our results indicate that down-regulation of ASIC1a by antagonists or antisense oligonucleotide reduces tissue damage and promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. This study reveals a cellular and molecular mechanism by which ASIC1a is involved in the secondary damage process after traumatic SCI. Our results suggest that blockade of Ca(2+) -permeable ASIC1a may be a potential neuroprotection strategy for the treatment of SCI patients.","sodium"

Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC(50) of 2 μM. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 μM BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K(d) = 170 μM) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K(d) = 5 μM) and even more tightly (K(d) = 0.2 μM) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 μM. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels.","sodium"

The intrinsic excitability of spinal neurons provides a novel target for medical intervention. Studies in animal models have shown that persistent inward currents, such as persistent sodium currents, profoundly influence neuronal excitability, and recovery of persistent inward currents in spinal neurons of animals with spinal cord injury routinely coincides with the appearance of spastic reflexes. Pharmacologically, this neuronal excitability can be decreased by agents that reduce persistent inward currents, such as the selective persistent sodium current inhibitor riluzole. We were able to recruit seven subjects with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury who were not concurrently taking antispasticity medications into the study. Reflex responses (flexion withdrawal and H-reflexes) and volitional strength (isometric maximum voluntary contractions) were tested at the ankle before and after placebo-controlled, double-blinded oral administration of riluzole (50 mg). Riluzole significantly decreased the peak ankle dorsiflexion torque component of the flexion withdrawal reflex. Peak maximum voluntary torque in both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion directions was not significantly changed. Average dorsiflexion torque sustained during the 5-s isometric maximum voluntary contraction, however, increased significantly. There was no effect, however, on the monosynaptic plantar and dorsiflexor H-reflex responses. Overall, these results demonstrate a contribution of persistent sodium conductances to polysynaptic reflex excitability in human chronic spinal cord injury without a significant role in maximum strength production. These results suggest that intrinsic spinal cellular excitability could be a target for managing chronic spinal cord injury hyperreflexia impairments without causing a significant loss in volitional strength.","sodium"

(2) What is the preclinical evidence for Rho antagonists that have allowed this group of compounds to move into clinical trials? (3) What is the evidence for early surgical decompression after SCI? We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE-cited articles related to SCI to address these questions. As a result of an improved understanding of the secondary mechanisms of SCI, specific clinical strategies have been established. We highlight three strategies that have made their way from bench to bedside: the sodium-glutamate antagonist riluzole, the Rho inhibitor Cethrin, and early surgical decompression. Each of these modalities is under clinical investigation. We highlight the fundamental science that led to this development. As our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of SCI improves, we must keep abreast of these discoveries to translate them into therapies that will hopefully benefit patients.

A phase I safety clinical trial of riluzole is about to commence in the USA and Canada.  The key challenges in translating riluzole to the clinic relate to uncertainty regarding the time window for post-injury administration of riluzole and the optimal dose. Hence, the current study was undertaken to study these issues in a preclinical model of cervical SCI in rodents.  Adult female rats received moderate cervical spinal cord clip compression injury (35 g × 1 min at C7-T1) and were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups (n = 12/group): a) 8 mg/kg of riluzole intraperitoneally at 1 hour (P1 group) ; b) 3 hours (P3 group) after injury or c) a control group (vehicle). The P1 and P3 groups then received 6 mg/kg of riluzole intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 7 days. A smaller group of rats (n = 10) received a higher dose (8 mg/kg IP Q12 h for 7 days) of riluzole following the initial dosing. Functional recovery was tested by open field locomotion (BBB score, BBB subscore) and grid walk. Sensory function (tactile allodynia) was assessed by quantitative von Frey filament testing. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were performed to quantitatively assess central axonal conduction. Western blotting for neurofilament 200 (NF200) was used to assess axonal integrity. Quantitative image analysis of lesion histology (HE/LFB stained sections) was undertaken to assess tissue sparing at the injury site. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to test pharmacokinetics of riluzole. ANOVA followed by the Tukey's post-hoc testing was used to compare the results.  A total of 92.3% of injured rats that received repeated dose of 6 mg/kg riluzole survived during the term of 6 weeks, showing tolerance to this dosage. In contrast, higher doses of riluzole (8mg/kg IP q12h post-injury) were associated with significant respiratory depression and high mortality (7/10 rats). Riluzole treatment (P1 group) decreased the functional deficit significantly (P < 0.05) at 6 weeks after injury by showing 11.4 in BBB, 3.8 in BBB subscore and 2.8 in grid walk test, compared with 10.25 in BBB, 1.1 in BBB subscore, and 8.0 in grid walk test of control group (Figure 1). Quantitative analysis of SSEPs confirmed the neuroprotective effects of riluzole (P1 group) by showing significantly larger amplitude (control = 20.67 µV, P1 = 42.67 µV and P3 = 37.00 µV, Figure 2) and reduced response latency (control = 4.05 ms and P1 = 3.9 ms). Western blotting of NF200 indicated greater axonal preservation with riluzole treatment (P1 group) at 1 week after injury. The P3 group showed trends to improved neurobehavioral recovery and axonal preservation that did not attain significance. HPLC showed riluzole penetrated into the spinal cord as fast as 15 minutes, accumulated in the spinal cord at a concentration six times higher than in plasma, and two times higher than in brain. The drug stayed in spinal cord with a high concentration before the next injection. Figure 1 Riluzole treatment improved functional recovery. The most robust effects were seen when the drug was injected at one hour after SCIFigure 2 Riluzole treatment increased amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials Conclusions:  The sodium-glutamate blocker riluzole confers neurobehavioral and anatomical neuroprotection when administered one hour after moderately severe cervical contusive/compressive injury.","sodium"

Literature review of anatomical, immunohistochemical, and pharmacologic studies of normal and dysfunctional bladder afferent pathways. Studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through coordination centers (periaqueductal gray and pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brain stem. This reflex pathway, which is activated by small myelinated (Adelta) bladder afferent nerves, is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Spinal cord injury at cervical or thoracic levels disrupts voluntary voiding, as well as the normal reflex pathways that coordinate bladder and sphincter function. Following spinal cord injury, the bladder is initially areflexic but then becomes hyperreflexic due to the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. The recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury is dependent in part on the plasticity of bladder afferent pathways and the unmasking of reflexes triggered by unmyelinated, capsaicin-sensitive, C-fiber bladder afferent neurons. Plasticity is associated with morphologic, chemical, and electrical changes in bladder afferent neurons and appears to be mediated in part by neurotrophic factors released in the spinal cord and the peripheral target organs. Spinal cord injury at sites remote from the lumbosacral spinal cord can indirectly influence properties of bladder afferent neurons by altering the function and chemical environment in the bladder or the spinal cord.","sodium"

During 2-year, all patients with cervical cord injury were treated with MPSS within 8 hours of their injuries based on the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study protocol (MPSS group). During the next 2-year, all patients were treated without MPSS (non-MPSS group). There were 38 patients in the MPSS group and 41 in the non-MPSS. Early spinal decompression and stabilization was performed as soon after injury in both the groups.

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, p-SAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model.

Influx of Na(+) ions into cells has been postulated to be a key early event in the pathogenesis of secondary traumatic and ischemic central nervous system injury. Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole--after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), phenytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p<0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na(+) blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin.","sodium"

This neural system coordinates the activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract: (1) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (2) an outlet (consisting of bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the pelvic floor). During urine storage the outlet is closed and the bladder is quiescent, thereby maintaining a low intravesical pressure over a wide range of bladder volumes. During micturition the outlet relaxes and the bladder contracts to promote the release of urine. This reciprocal relationship between bladder and outlet is generated by visceral reflex circuits, some of which are under voluntary control. Experimental studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination center (the pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brainstem. This reflex pathway is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex that are presumably involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Spinal cord injury at cervical or thoracic levels disrupts voluntary control of voiding as well as the normal reflex pathways that coordinate bladder and sphincter functions. Following spinal cord injury, the bladder is initially areflexic but then becomes hyperreflexic due to the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. Studies in animals indicate that the recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury is dependent in part on plasticity of bladder afferent pathways and the unmasking of reflexes triggered by capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber bladder afferent neurons. The plasticity is associated with changes in the properties of ion channels and electrical excitability of afferent neurons, and appears to be mediated in part by neurotrophic factors released in the spinal cord and the peripheral target organs.","sodium"

However, in this instance, recovery is significantly accelerated; i.e., it is evident as early as 2 weeks after spinal cord injury. Two experimental groups (and noninjured and sham-operated controls) of rats were employed in the study. H-CBE animals were subjected to a left C2 hemisection plus bilateral carotid body excision while H-CBI animals were subjected to a left C2 hemisection only. Carotid body excision was confirmed by the sodium cyanide test. The animals were allowed to survive for 2 weeks after hemisection. Thereafter, electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity was conducted in all animals. Spontaneous recovery of respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed hemidiaphragm (indicated by left phrenic nerve activity) was detected in all H-CBE animals while H-CBI animals did not express spontaneous recovery of diaphragmatic activity. The magnitude of recovered activity when expressed as a function of contralateral phrenic nerve activity was 48.8 +/- 3.8%. When expressed as a function of the homolateral phrenic nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude amounted to 25.6 +/- 2.8%. Although the mechanisms responsible for the apparent early onset of spontaneous recovery are unknown, it is likely that a reorganization of the respiratory circuitry in the CNS may be involved. The significance of the findings is that it may be feasible to modulate the onset of functional recovery following cervical spinal cord injury by specifically targeting peripheral chemoreceptors.","sodium"

Subsequent trials of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) and GM-1 have added to the evidence basis that informs the current management practices for acute SCI. The last 50 years have seen a conceptual shift from the pessimism of the past to a cautious optimism that the meager prognosis for neurologic recovery in acute SCI will yield to the progress of medical science. Major advances in the understanding of primary and secondary injury mechanisms have led to the preclinical study of many promising pharmacological therapies, all with the goal of improving neurologic outcome. A few of these drugs have stood the test of animal model experiments and have made it to the forum of human clinical trials. The NASCIS trials of methylprednisolone have been acknowledged widely as the first human studies to claim improved neurologic outcome. Although the results of these trials remain controversial, the MPSS therapy that they reported has been adopted widely by clinicians around the world as the best currently available, even if not a consensus ""standard of care.""

Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of TTX in SCI is related to its preservation of axons per se; no effect on chronic white matter cell composition was detected. They highlight the profound changes in cellular composition in preserved white matter chronically at 6 weeks after injury, including the accumulation of endogenous progenitor cells and the persistence of activated macrophages/microglia. The manipulation of these endogenous cells may be used in the future to enhance recovery after SCI.","sodium"

In this study, we hypothesized that phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker, would result in protection of axons with concomitant improvement of functional recovery after SCI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 contusion SCI after being fed normal chow or chow containing phenytoin; serum levels of phenytoin were within therapeutic range at the time of injury. At various timepoints after injury, quantitative assessment of lesion volumes, axonal degeneration, axonal conduction, and functional locomotor recovery were performed. When compared to controls, phenytoin-treated animals demonstrated reductions in the degree of destruction of gray and white matter surrounding the lesion epicenter, sparing of axons within the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) and dorsal column (DC) system rostral to the lesion site, and within the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) caudal to the lesion site, and enhanced axonal conduction across the lesion site. Improved performance in measures of skilled locomotor function was observed in phenytoin-treated animals. Based on these results, we conclude that phenytoin provides neuroprotection and improves functional outcome after experimental SCI, and that it merits further examination as a potential treatment strategy in human SCI.","sodium"

In the present study we examined the role of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) at physiological temperatures after hypoxia/ischemia and compressive injury to spinal cord dorsal column white matter in vitro. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber (maintained at 37 degrees C) and injured by exposure to a hypoxic atmosphere for 60 minutes or compressed with a modified aneurysm clip (2-gm closing force) for 15 seconds. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential (CAP) with glass microelectrodes. The mean CAP decreased to 49.5 +/- 5.7% and 49.4 +/- 2.6% of control (p<.05) after hypoxia/ischemia and compressive injury, respectively. KB-R7943, a potent, selective NCX reverse mode inhibitor, significantly promoted greater recovery of CAP amplitude to 82.0 +/- 10.0% and 70.8 +/- 10.7% of control (p<.05) after hypoxic/ischemic or compressive injury to dorsal column white matter, respectively, when applied at 10 microM concentration. Bepridil (Research Biochemical Inc., Natick, MA, USA) (a less selective NCX inhibitor), when applied at 10 microM and 50 microM concentration promoted CAP amplitude recovery only to 46.8 +/- 7.8% and 29.9 +/- 3.3% of control, respectively, after hypoxic/ischemic injury to dorsal column white matter. Western blot analysis identified NCX presence with positive immunolabeling of 160 kD and 120 kD NCX proteins in the spinal cord white matter. In conclusion, at physiological temperature NCX activation plays an important role in intracellular calcium overload after hypoxic/ischemic and compressive injury to spinal cord dorsal column white matter in vitro.","sodium"

In the present work, we examine PROG effects on three measures of neuronal function under negative regulation (choline acetyltransferase [ChAT] and Na,K-ATPase) or stimulated (growth-associated protein [GAP-43]) after acute spinal cord transection injury in rats. As expected, spinal cord injury reduced ChAT immunostaining intensity of ventral horn neurons. A 3-day course of intensive PROG treatment of transected rats restored ChAT immunoreactivity, as assessed by frequency histograms that recorded shifts from predominantly light neuronal staining to medium, dark or intense staining typical of control rats. Transection also reduced the expression of the mRNA for the alpha3 catalytic and beta1 regulatory subunits of neuronal Na,K-ATPase, whereas PROG treatment restored both subunit mRNA to normal levels. Additionally, the upregulation observed for GAP-43 mRNA in ventral horn neurons in spinal cord-transected rats, was further enhanced by PROG administration. In no case did PROG modify ChAT immunoreactivity, Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNA or GAP-43 mRNA in control, sham-operated rats. Further, the PROG-mediated effects on these three markers were observed in large, presumably Lamina IX motoneurons, as well as in smaller neurons measuring approximately <500 micro2. Overall, the stimulatory effects of PROG on ChAT appears to replenish acetylcholine, with its stimulatory effects on Na,K-ATPase seems capable of restoring membrane potential, ion transport and nutrient uptake. PROG effects on GAP-43 also appear to accelerate reparative responses to injury. As the cellular basis for PROG neuroprotection becomes better understood it may prove of therapeutic benefit to spinal cord injury patients.","sodium"

The mechanisms for its beneficial actions are not entirely clear, but experimental evidence suggests MPSS affords some degree of neuroprotection. As many studies with rat models of SCI have been unable to demonstrate improved behavioral outcome or tissue sparing after MPSS treatment, we chose to stereologically assess whether it alters lesion volume and tissue sparing over time, as well as long-term behavioral recovery. Adult rats subjected to contusion SCI with the NYU impactor were administered either MPSS or saline for 24 hr beginning 5 min post injury. Over time the lesion dimensions were extremely dynamic, such that by 6 weeks post injury the volumes were reduced to a third of those seen after the first week. MPSS marginally reduced lesion volumes across time vs. controls, but the amount of spared gray and white matter remained unaltered between the two groups. Behavioral results further showed that MPSS failed to improve recovery of hind-limb function. These findings add to the emerging scrutiny of MPSS as the standard therapy for acute SCI, as well as indicate the existence of a therapeutic window for tissue sparing restricted to the first several days after this type of SCI in rats. Equally important, our results caution the use of lesion volume dimensions or percent tissue sparing at the epicenter as indicators of therapeutic efficacy because neither reflects the actual amount of tissue sparing.","sodium"

However, the precise cellular mechanisms of glutamate release from non-synaptic white matter are not well understood. We examined how the collapse of transmembrane Na(+) and K(+) gradients induces reverse operation of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporters, leading to glutamate efflux and injury to rat spinal dorsal columns in vitro. Compound action potentials were irreversibly reduced to 43% of control after ouabain/high K(+)/low Na(+) exposure (500 microM ouabain for 30 min to increase [Na(+)](i), followed by 1 h ouabain+high K(+) (129 mM)/low Na(+) (27 mM), to further reverse transmembrane ion gradients) followed by a 2 h wash. Ca(2+)-free perfusate was very protective (compound action potential amplitude recovered to 87% vs. 43%). The broad spectrum glutamate antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM) or the selective AMPA antagonist GYKI52466 (30 microM) were partially protective (68% recovery). Inhibition of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport with L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (1 mM) also provided significant protection (71% recovery), similar to that seen with glutamate receptor antagonists. Blocking reverse Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange with KB-R7943 (10 microM) however, was ineffective in this paradigm (49% recovery). Semiquantitative glutamate immunohistochemistry revealed that levels of this amino acid were significantly depleted in axon cylinders and, to a lesser degree, in oligodendrocytes (but not in astrocytes) by ouabain/high K(+)/low Na(+), which was largely prevented by glutamate transport inhibition. Our data show that dorsal column white matter contains the necessary glutamate pools and release mechanisms to induce significant injury. When Na(+) and K(+) gradients are disrupted, even in the absence of reduced cellular energy reserves, reverse operation of Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport will release enough endogenous glutamate to activate AMPA receptors and cause substantial Ca(2+)-dependent injury. This mechanism likely plays an important role during ischemic and traumatic white matter injury, where collapse of transmembrane Na(+) and K(+) gradients occurs.","sodium"

Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment. This first decade of the new millennium, now touted as the Decade of the Spine, will hopefully witness the emergence of universal and efficacious pharmacologic therapy and ultimately a cure for SCI.","sodium"

Functional neurological recovery of coordinated hindlimb function and strength, assessed 1 week postinjury and weekly thereafter for 6 weeks, was significantly enhanced in animals treated with riluzole compared with the other treatment groups. Seven weeks postinjury the preservation of residual tissue and integrity of descending axons were determined with digital morphometrical and fluorescent histochemical analysis. All three Na+ channel blockers significantly enhanced residual tissue area at the injury epicenter compared with control. Riluzole significantly reduced tissue loss in rostrocaudal regions surrounding the epicenter, with overall sparing of gray matter and selective sparing of white matter. Also, counts of red nuclei neurons retrogradely labeled with fluorogold introduced caudal to the injury site were significantly increased in the riluzole group.

In order to determine the doses, durations and timing of methylprednisolone treatment for optimal neuroprotection, a single or two bolus dose of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) was administered at 10, 30, 120, 150 and 240 min. after three graded spinal cord injury. The primary outcome measure was 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes estimated from spinal cord Na+ and K+ shifts. A single 30 mg/kg dose of methylprednisolone at 10 min. after injury significantly reduced 24-hour lesion volumes in injured rat spinal cords. However, any other methylprednisolone treatment starting 30 min. or more after injury had no effect on 24-hour lesion volumes compared to the vehicle control group. Moreover, delayed treatment increased lesion volumes in some cases. These results suggest that the NYU SCI model has a very short therapeutic window.","sodium"

This study utilized naturally injured, neurologically complete paraplegic dogs as a model for human spinal cord injury. The recovery of paraplegic dogs treated with oscillating electric field stimulation (OFS) (approximately 500 to 600 microV/mm; n = 20) was compared with that of sham-treated animals (n = 14). Active and sham stimulators were fabricated in West Lafayette, Indiana. They were coded, randomized, sterilized, and packaged in Warsaw, Indiana, and returned to Purdue University for blinded surgical implantation. The stimulators were of a previously unpublished design and meet the requirements for phase I human clinical testing. All dogs were treated within 18 days of the onset of paraplegia. During the experimental applications, all received the highest standard of conventional management, including surgical decompression, spinal stabilization (if required), and acute administration of methylprednisolone sodium succinate. A radiologic and neurologic examination was performed on every dog entering the study, the latter consisting of standard reflex testing, urologic tests, urodynamic testing, tests for deep and superficial pain appreciation, proprioceptive placing of the hind limbs, ambulation, and evoked potential testing. Dogs were evaluated before and after surgery and at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. A greater proportion of experimentally treated dogs than of sham-treated animals showed improvement in every category of functional evaluation at both the 6-week and 6-month recheck, with no reverse trend. Statistical significance was not reached in comparisons of some individual categories of functional evaluation between sham-treated and OFS-treated dogs (ambulation, proprioceptive placing); an early trend towards significance was shown in others (deep pain), and significance was reached in evaluations of superficial pain appreciation. An average of all individual scores for all categories of blinded behavioral evaluation (combined neurologic score) was used to compare group outcomes. At the 6-month recheck period, the combined neurologic score of OFS-treated dogs was significantly better than that of control dogs (p = 0.047; Mann-Whitney, two-tailed).","sodium"

We hypothesized that blockade of sodium channels after SCI would reduce WM loss and long-term functional deficits. To test this hypothesis, a sufficient and safe dose (0.15 nmol) of the potent Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) was determined through a dose-response study. We microinjected TTX or vehicle (VEH) into the injury site at 15 min after a standardized contusive SCI in the rat. Behavioral tests were performed 1 d after injury and weekly thereafter. Quantitative histopathology at 8 weeks postinjury showed that TTX treatment significantly reduced tissue loss at the injury site, with greater effect on sparing of WM than gray matter. TTX did not change the pattern of chronic histopathology typical of this SCI model, but restricted its extent, tripled the area of residual WM at the epicenter, and reduced the average length of the lesions. Serotonin immunoreactivity caudal to the epicenter, a marker for descending motor control axons, was nearly threefold that of VEH controls. The increase in WM at the epicenter was significantly correlated with the decrease in functional deficits. The TTX group exhibited a significantly enhanced recovery of coordinated hindlimb functions, more normal hindlimb reflexes, and earlier establishment of a reflex bladder. The results demonstrate that Na+ channels play a critical role in WM loss in vivo after SCI.","sodium"

Central myelinated axons are damaged by anoxia/ischemia in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Leakage of Na+ into the axoplasm through Na+ channels causes Ca2+ overload mainly by reverse Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Na+ channel blockers have thus been shown to be protective in an in vitro anoxic rat optic nerve model. Mexiletine (10 microM-1 mM), an antiarrhythmic and use-dependent Na+ channel blocker, was also significantly protective, as measured by recovery of the compound action potential after a 60 min anoxic exposure in vitro. More importantly, mexiletine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly protected optic nerves from injury in a model of in situ ischemia. This in situ model is more clinically relevant as it addresses drug pharmacokinetics, toxicity and CNS penetration. Optic nerve recovery cycles (defined as shifts in latency of compound action potentials with paired stimulation) were used to measure the concentration of mexiletine in optic nerves after systemic administration, estimated at approximately 42 microM 1 h after a single dose of 80 mg/kg, i.p. These results indicate that mexiletine is able to penetrate into the CNS at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection.

In this study, we examined the role of Na+ in mediating traumatic injury to spinal cord axons. Dorsal column segments from adult rats (n = 87) were isolated and maintained in an in vitro recording chamber while being superfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution (95% O2/5% CO2, 25 degrees C). Selected experiments (n = 10) also were done at 33 degrees C. Compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded from microelectrodes. Injury was performed by compression of the dorsal column segment for 15 sec with a modified aneurysm clip exerting a closing force of 2 gm. With injury, the CAP decreased to 72.1 +/- 9.6% of baseline values. Removal of extracellular Na+ and replacement with the impermeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine enhanced recovery of the CAP to 98.3 +/- 18.3% (p < 0.05) of baseline. The Na+ channel blockers tetrodotoxin and procaine also improved recovery of the CAP to 96.3 +/- 23.7% (p < 0.05) and 82.8 +/- 4.6% (p < 0.05) of baseline values, respectively. In contrast, increasing Na+ permeability with veratridine resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude after 1 hr of trauma (60.1 +/- 8.4%, p < 0.05). Similarly, prevention of extrusion of Na+ from the intracellular compartment by inhibiting the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump with ouabain resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude at 1 hr after trauma (56.7 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.05). The Na(+)-H+ exchange blockers amiloride (100 microM) and harmaline (100 microM) significantly improved recovery after injury to 89.6 +/- 17.0% (p < 0.05) and 85.7 +/- 7.2% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively. However, administration of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange blockers benzamil (100 or 500 microM) and bepridil (50 microM) was ineffective. In summary, reduction of extracellular Na+ confers neuroprotection after spinal cord injury in vitro. Intracellular sodium rises appear to be mediated by voltage-gated Na+ channels. Blockade of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger also is neuroprotective, possibly by reducing intracellular acidosis. Furthermore, prevention of extrusion of intracellular Na+ by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pump exacerbates the effects of compression trauma. However, reverse operation of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger does not explain the injurious effects of Na+ in traumatically injured CNS white matter.","sodium"

There is evidence that intracellular Na+ entry potentiates hypoxic-ischemic cell death by causing cytotoxic cell swelling, intracellular acidosis, and gating of Ca++ entry through reverse activation of the Na(+)-Ca++ exchanger. In the present study, we have examined the role of Na+e in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury. Dorsal column segments isolated from the thoracic cord of adult rats (n = 40) were pinned in a recording chamber and superfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution.

This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation.

Because GM1 may have additive or synergistic effects when used with MP, the authors compared MP, GM1, and MP+GM1 treatments in a graded rat spinal cord contusion model. Spinal cord injury was caused by dropping a rod weighing 10 gm from a height of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 cm onto the rat spinal cord at T-10, which had been exposed via laminectomy. The lesion volumes were quantified from spinal cord Na and K shifts at 24 hours after injury and the results were verified histologically in separate experiments. A single dose of MP (30 mg/kg), given 5 minutes after injury, reduced 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes by 56% (p = 0.0052), 28% (p = 0.0065), and 13% (p > 0.05) in the three injury-severity groups, respectively, compared to similarly injured control groups treated with vehicle only. Methylprednisolone also prevented injury-induced hyponatremia and increased body weight loss in the spine-injured rats. When used alone, GM1 (10 to 30 mg/kg) had little or no effect on any measured variable compared to vehicle controls; when given concomitantly with MP, GM1 blocked the neuroprotective effects of MP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, GM1 partially prevented MP-induced reductions in lesion volumes, while 10 to 30 mg/kg of GM1 completely blocked these effects of MP. The effects of MP on injury-induced hyponatremia and body weight loss were also blocked by GM1. Thus, GM1 antagonized both central and peripheral effects of MP in spine-injured rats. Until this interaction is clarified, the authors recommend that MP and GM1 not be used concomitantly to treat acute human spinal cord injury. Because GM1 modulates protein kinase activity, protein kinases inhibit lipocortins, and lipocortins mediate anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, it is proposed that the neuroprotective effects of MP are partially due to anti-inflammatory effects and that GM1 antagonizes the effects of MP by inhibiting lipocortin. Possible beneficial effects of GM1 reported in central nervous system injury may be related to the effects on neural recovery rather than acute injury processes.","sodium"

The interstitial ionic changes were completely reversible within 90 min following injury. Measurements of the ion content in a tissue sample from the injury site (flame photometry) showed an increase of sodium and calcium and a decrease of potassium 5 min after injury. The magnitude of the post-injury sodium change was much larger than the potassium change, both for interstitial and tissue measurements. Treatment of the animals with the calcium entry blocker flunarizine before the injury did not influence the magnitude of post-injury interstitial calcium decrease but significantly increased the rate of subsequent recovery. Pre-injury flunarizine treatment also significantly increased the recovery rate of the electrical potential. The experiments suggest the occurrence of a net ionic shift towards the intracellular space, which may contribute to oedema formation in the very early post-injury period. The post-injury decrease of interstitial calcium activity is probably not mediated by flunarizine-sensitive calcium entry mechanisms; such mechanisms may, however, be involved in the subsequent recovery period for interstitial calcium activity. Calcium ions may be involved in the recovery process of the negative electrical potential after injury.","sodium"

Myelinated axons display a complementary distribution of sodium channels (clustered in the nodal axon membrane) and fast potassium channels (in the internodal axon membrane). The low density of sodium channels in the internodal axon membrane will impede conduction after demyelination. Moreover, ""unmasked"" potassium channels will tend to clamp the axon membrane close to EK, interfering with conduction in demyelinated axons. Pharmacologic blockade of these potassium channels can increase the safety factor for conduction in demyelinated axons. Restoration of conduction in demyelinated axons, so that action potentials can traverse the zone without myelin, appears to underly clinical remissions in patients with multiple sclerosis and may occur in some patients with spinal cord injury. At a cellular level, conduction through demyelinated axon regions can be facilitated by several mechanisms, including remyelination, development of excitability in demyelinated regions (which requires an adequate density of sodium channels), and impedance matching. Astrocytes have been shown to establish a specific relationship with sodium channel-rich regions of the axon membrane, and may play a role in the deployment and/or maintenance of sodium channels within the demyelinated axon membrane. Calcium influx appears to play a critical role in the cascade of events leading to secondary injury after spinal cord trauma. Recent observations suggest the hypothesis that myelin damage in spinal cord trauma may be mediated, at least in part, by influx of calcium into an intracellular compartment. As the route of calcium entry is identified and characterized, it may be possible to design strategies that will limit secondary injury after CNS trauma. The deleterious effects of calcium in injured white matter accumulate gradually, which suggests the potential reversibility of dysfunction in spinal cord tracts if treated early after trauma.","sodium"

Studies in animals have shown that monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM-1) ganglioside enhances the functional recovery of damaged neurons. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of GM-1 ganglioside was conducted in patients with spinal-cord injuries. Of 37 patients entered into the study, 34 (23 with cervical injuries and 11 with thoracic injuries) completed the test-drug protocol (100 mg of GM-1 sodium salt or placebo intravenously per day for 18 to 32 doses, with the first dose taken within 72 hours of the injury) and a one-year follow-up period. Neurologic recovery was assessed with the Frankel scale (comprising five categories) and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score (a scale of scores from 0 to 100, derived from strength tests of 20 specific muscles, each scored from 0 to 5). There was a significant difference between groups in the distribution of improvement of Frankel grades from base line to the one-year follow-up (improvement of 0, 1, 2, and 3 grades in 13, 4, 1, and 0 patients, respectively, in the placebo group and 8, 1, 6, and 1 patients, respectively, in the GM-1 group; P = 0.034 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test). The GM-1-treated patients also had a significantly greater mean improvement in ASIA motor score from base line to the one-year follow-up than the placebo-treated patients (36.9 vs. 21.6 points; P = 0.047 by analysis of covariance with the base-line ASIA motor score as the covariate). An analysis of individual muscle recoveries revealed that the increased recovery in the GM-1 group was attributable to initially paralyzed muscles that regained useful motor strength rather than to strengthening of paretic muscles. This small study provides evidence that GM-1 enhances the recovery of neurologic function after one year. A larger study must be conducted, however, before GM-1 is considered efficacious and safe in treating spinal-cord injury.","sodium"

These include the synthetic glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP), and the new 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, U74006F. Treatment of spinal cord-injured cats with high doses of MP promoted or spared locomotor function and preserved spinal cord tissue. Extending these findings in cats to humans, it was recently demonstrated that high doses of MP administered within 8 h of injury significantly improved neurologic recovery in human spinal cord-injured patients. The compound U74006F is one of a series of 21-aminosteroids that, unlike MP, lack glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid or other hormonal activity yet are potent inhibitors of lipid perioxidation. Over a 100-fold range of doses, U74006F promoted recovery of locomotor function in spinal cord-injured cats. The lowest effective dose for U74006F was 100 times lower than the maximally effective dose for MP. The efficacy of U74006F is unchanged if treatment is initiated within 4 h of injury. However, if treatment is delayed for 8 h, the therapeutic potency of U74006F is substantially reduced. These findings suggest that antioxidant therapy can successfully limit the effects of both experimental and clinical spinal cord injury especially if the treatment is initiated shortly after injury.","sodium"

Guanabenz acetate was administered twice daily for 8 weeks. In the first group, the treatment significantly increased blood flow in the abdominal aorta. All cats treated with guanabenz acetate 3 hr after spinal cord contusion had return of micturition and none suffered complete paraplegia. Four animals had partial and the other four had complete motor recovery. A superoxide (O2-.) generating system, horseradish peroxidase, decreased [14C]gamma amino butyric acid uptake by mouse cortical slices by 33% but when superoxide dismutase was added to the medium, the uptake was reduced by only 9%. The nerve endings were also protected by superoxide dismutase from morphologic damage by O2-. as observed by electron microscopy. The agents used in these studies produce their ameliorating effects by virtue of their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and membrane stabilizing properties, and enhancing the regional microcirculation. In addition to having these properties, guanabenz acetate is also an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist.","sodium"

The present study examined the effects of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker MK-801 on neurochemical sequelae following experimental fluid-percussion brain injury in the rat. Fifteen minutes after fluid-percussion brain injury (2.8 atmospheres), animals received either MK-801 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or saline. MK-801 treatment significantly attenuated the development of focal brain edema at the site of injury 48 h after brain injury, significantly reduced the increase in tissue sodium, and prevented the localized decline in total tissue magnesium that was observed in injured tissue of saline-treated animals. Using phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we also observed that MK-801 treatment improved brain metabolic status and promoted a significant recovery of intracellular free magnesium concentrations that fell precipitously after brain injury. These results suggest that excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters may be involved in the pathophysiological sequelae of traumatic brain injury and that noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists may effectively attenuate some of the potentially deleterious neurochemical sequelae of brain injury.","sodium"

Animals were randomly assigned to either treatment group (10 cats per group), and all personnel were blind as to which animals received vehicle or drug. The intensive 48-hour dosing regimen was designed to maintain therapeutic tissue levels of MP and consisted of an initial 30 mg/kg intravenous bolus of MP; 2 and 6 hours later additional 15 mg/kg MP doses were administered by intravenous bolus. Immediately following the bolus given at 6 hours, a continuous MP infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/hr was started. The infusion was stopped abruptly at 48 hours with no dose tapering. Animals in the vehicle group received an equivalent volume of MP vehicle. The total MP dose administered over 48 hours was 165 mg/kg. Animals were evaluated weekly for neurological recovery based upon a 12-point functional scale which assessed general mobility, running, and stair-climbing. Mean recovery scores at 1 month after injury (+/- standard error of the mean) were: vehicle group (seven cats) 3.7 +/- 0.9, and MP group (10 cats) 8.7 +/- 0.2; (p less than 0.001). Histological evaluation of the spinal cords revealed a strong negative correlation between neurological recovery and size of the spinal cord cavity at 1 month (r = -0.88). Three of 10 animals in the vehicle group became ill and had to be dropped from the study, whereas all of the 10 MP-treated animals survived in excellent health. The results demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness and low incidence of side effects associated with an intensive MP dose regimen for treatment of experimental spinal cord injury.","sodium"

Among the earliest biochemical reactions are hydrolysis of fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, production of biologically active eicosanoids, and peroxidation of lipids. This study examines the effect of agents purported to improve recovery following spinal cord trauma, methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) and the combination of alpha-tocopherol and selenium (Se), on the posttraumatic alterations of membrane lipid metabolism. Pretreatment with either MPSS or alpha-tocopherol and Se reduced the trauma-induced release of total FFA including arachidonate in the injured spinal cord tissue. In addition, these agents decreased the postinjury levels of prostanoids. Pretreatment with either MPSS or alpha-tocopherol and Se also completely prevented the trauma-induced loss of cholesterol while inhibiting the increase of a cholesterol peroxidation product, 25-hydroxycholesterol. These data suggest that: perturbation of membrane lipid metabolism may contribute to the tissue necrosis and functional deficit of spinal cord injury and MPSS or the combination of alpha-tocopherol and Se may protect injured spinal cord tissue, at least in part, by limiting these posttraumatic membrane lipid changes.","sodium"

A retrospective study of all individuals admitted to our hospital (Delaware Valley Spinal Cord Injury Center) with central cervical spinal cord injury was done (28 patients). One-half had been treated with medical therapy alone (Group I); the others were treated both medically and surgically (Group II). Medical therapy consisted of intravenous mannitol, dexamethasone, and sodium bicarbonate given during the acute phase of the injury. Both groups were immobilized using either a halo or a Philadelphia collar. Criteria for entry into the surgical group were one or both of the following: (a) failure to improve progressively after an initial period of improvement, with persistent compression of neural tissue visualized on myelography and (b) unacceptable instability of the spinal bony elements. The patients were given neurological scores based on the motor power of the major muscle groups. The stability of the spine was scored using the Panjabi-White scale. The two groups were compared using Student's t-test and the two-factor analysis of variance. There was no significant difference in initial neurological scores between the groups.

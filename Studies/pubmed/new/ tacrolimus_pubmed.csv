Interestingly, it has been reported that FK506 increases neurite outgrowth in cell cultures, implying a potential impact in putative treatments of neurodegenerative disorders and injuries of the nervous system. Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of this compound is poorly understood and remains to be elucidated, with the only certainty that its neurotrophic effect is independent of its primary immunosuppressant activity. In this study it is demonstrated that FK506 shows efficient neurotrophic action in vitro and profound effects on the recovery of locomotor activity, behavioural features, and erectile function of mice that underwent surgical spinal cord injury. The recovery of the locomotor activity was studied in knock-out mice for either immunophilin, FKBP51 or FKBP52. The experimental evidence demonstrates that the neurotrophic actions of FK506 are the consequence of its binding to FKBP52, whereas FK506 interaction with the close-related partner immunophilin FKBP51 antagonises the function of FKBP52. Importantly, our study also demonstrates that other immunophilins do not replace FKBP52. It is concluded that the final biological response is the resulting outcome of the drug binding to both immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, the latter being the one that commands the dominant neurotrophic action in vivo.","tacrolimus"

While advances in surgical and medical techniques have certainly improved this outlook, limitations in functional recovery continue to impede clinically significant improvements. These limitations are dependent on evolving immunological mechanisms that shape the cellular environment at the site of SCI. In this review, we examine these mechanisms, identify relevant cellular components, and discuss emerging treatments in stem cell grafts and adjuvant immunosuppressants that target these pathways. As the field advances, we expect that stem cell grafts and these adjuvant treatments will significantly shift therapeutic approaches to acute SCI with the potential for more promising outcomes.","tacrolimus"

These immature human neural cells have been demonstrated to survive when transplanted in vivo, extend neural processes, form synaptic contacts, and improve functional outcomes after experimental SCI. A phase II single blind, randomized proof-of-concept study of the safety and efficacy of HuCNS-SC transplantation into the cervical spinal cord was undertaken in patients with chronic C5-7 tetraplegia, 4-24 months post-injury. In Cohort I (n = 6) dose escalation from 15,000,000 to 40,000,000 cells was performed to determine the optimum dose. In Cohort II an additional six participants were transplanted at target dose (40,000,000) and compared with four untreated controls. Within the transplant group, there were nine American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) B and three AIS A participants with a median age at transplant of 28 years with an average time to transplant post-injury of 1 year. Immunosuppression was continued for 6 months post-transplant, and immunosuppressive blood levels of tacrolimus were achieved and well tolerated. At 1 year post-transplantation, there was no evidence of additional spinal cord damage, new lesions, or syrinx formation on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In summary, the incremental dose escalation design established surgical safety, tolerability, and feasibility in Cohort I. Interim analysis of Cohorts I and II demonstrated a trend toward Upper Extremity Motor Score (UEMS) and Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP) motor gains in the treated participants, but at a magnitude below the required clinical efficacy threshold set by the sponsor to support further development resulting in early study termination.","tacrolimus"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=56) were used to establish moderate SCI models, which were induced at the T10 spinal segment by dropping a 10-g weight from a height of 25 mm using a New York University Impactor device. The rats were randomly separated into the FK506 or control group (n=28 per group). Rats were treated with FK506 (0.5 mg/kg) or saline intravenously 30 min after sustaining the injury. Functional recovery was evaluated over 42 days following the injury, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels were detected. The astrocytes were treated with FK506 in vitro, and the EGF mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA, respectively. DNA microarray analysis was also performed to evaluate the genes in astrocytes. Rats in the FK506 group had improved locomotor functional recovery compared with those of control group. Furthermore, FK506 upregulated EGF expression of astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro. Subsequent to treatment with FK506-conditioned medium (CM), the length of neuronal cells increased 61.06% on the first day, and increased 56.4% on the third day compared with those of C-CM group. Furthermore, addition of anti-EGF neutralizing antibodies could interrupt the promotion of neurite outgrowth by FK506-CM. The present study indicates that astrocytes have an important role as mediators of FK506-improved spinal cord function recovery, and this partially clarifies the role of cell-cell interaction through modulating EGF in this process.","tacrolimus"

In order to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in such a process, an in vitro neuroproteomic-systems biology platform was developed in which the pan-proteomic profile of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cell line ND7/23 DRG was assessed in a large array of culture conditions using RhoAi and/or conditioned media obtained from SCI ex vivo derived spinal cord slices. A fine mapping of the spatio-temporal molecular events of the RhoAi treatment in SCI was performed. The data obtained allow a better understanding of regeneration/degeneration induced above and below the lesion site. Results notably showed a time-dependent alteration of the transcription factors profile along with the synthesis of growth cone-related factors (receptors, ligands, and signaling pathways) in RhoAi treated DRG cells. Furthermore, we assessed in a rat SCI model the in vivo impact of RhoAi treatment administered in situ via alginate scaffold that was combined with FK506 delivery. The improved recovery of locomotion was detected only at the early postinjury time points, whereas after overall survival a dramatic increase of synaptic contacts on outgrowing neurites in affected segments was observed. We validate these results by in vivo proteomic studies along the spinal cord segments from tissue and secreted media analyses, confirming the increase of the synaptogenesis expression factors under RhoAi treatment. Taken together, we demonstrate that RhoAi treatment seems to be useful to stimulate neurite outgrowth in both in vitro as well in vivo environments. However, for in vivo experiments there is a need for sustained delivery regiment to facilitate axon regeneration and promote synaptic reconnections with appropriate target neurons also at chronic phase, which in turn may lead to higher assumption for functional improvement.","tacrolimus"

The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of minocycline and FK506 (Tacrolimus) individually and in combination on recovery from experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). Young adult male rats were subjected to experimental SCI by weight compression method. Minocycline (50mg/kg) and FK506 (1mg/kg) were administered orally in combination and individually to the SCI group daily for three weeks. During these three weeks, the recovery was measured using behavioral motor parameters (including BBB, Tarlov and other scorings) every other day for 29days after SCI. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the segment of the spinal cord centered at the injury site was removed for the histopathological studies as well as for biochemical analysis of monoamines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and some oxidative stress indices, such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), total glutathione (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). All behavioral results indicated that both drugs induced significant recovery from SCI with respect to time. The biochemical and histopathological results supported the behavioral findings, revealing significant recovery in the regeneration of the injured spinal tissues, the monoamine levels, and the oxidative stress indices. Overall, the effects of the tested drugs for SCI recovery were as follows: FK506+minocycline>minocycline>FK506 in all studied parameters. Thus, minocycline and FK506 may prove to be a potential therapy cocktail to treat acute SCI. However, further studies are warranted.","tacrolimus"

Because distinct differences exist in the neuroanatomy and immunological responses between rodents and primates, it is critical to determine the effectiveness and safety of allografted embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NS/PCs (ESC-NS/PCs) in a nonhuman primate SCI model. In the present study, common marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group). In the control group, phosphate-buffered saline was injected instead of cells. In the presence of a low-dose of tacrolimus, several grafted cells survived without tumorigenicity and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Significant differences were found in the transverse areas of luxol fast blue-positive myelin sheaths, neurofilament-positive axons, corticospinal tract fibers, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive vessels at the lesion epicenter between the transplantation and control groups. Immunoelectron microscopic examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control group. In addition, a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay indicated that ESC-NS/PCs modulated the allogeneic immune rejection. Taken together, our results indicate that allogeneic transplantation of ESC-NS/PCs from a nonhuman primate promoted functional recovery after SCI without tumorigenicity. This study demonstrates that allogeneic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) promoted functional recovery after transplantation into the injured spinal cord in nonhuman primates. ESC-NS/PCs were chosen because ESC-NS/PCs are one of the controls for induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NS/PCs and because ESC derivatives are possible candidates for clinical use. This translational research using an allograft model of a nonhuman primate is critical for clinical application of grafting NS/PCs derived from various allogeneic pluripotent stem cells, especially induced pluripotent stem cells, into injured spinal cord at the subacute phase.","tacrolimus"

However, beneficial effects of iPSC-based therapy have so far been produced mostly using genetically immunodeficient rodents. Because of the long time required for generation and characterization of iPSCs, the use of autologous iPSCs for treating patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is not feasible. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to investigate the effect of iPSC-based therapy on functional recovery after SCI using pharmacologically immunosuppressed, immunocompetent animal models. Here we studied the functional outcome following subacute transplantation of human iPSC-derived NPCs into contused mouse spinal cord when tacrolimus was used as an immunosuppressive agent. We show that human iPSC-derived NPCs transplanted into pharmacologically immunosuppressed C57BL/6J mice exhibited poor long-term survival and failed to improve functional recovery after SCI as measured by Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) for locomotion and CatWalk gait analysis when compared to vehicle-treated animals. The scarce effect of iPSC-based therapy observed in the current study may be attributable to insufficient immunosuppressive effect, provided by monotherapy with tacrolimus in combination with immunogenicity of transplanted cells and complex microenvironment of the injured spinal cord. Our results highlight the importance of extensive preclinical studies of transplanted cells before the clinical application of iPSC-based cell therapy is achieved.","tacrolimus"

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have demonstrated beneficial effects following transplantation in animal models of SCI. However, despite the immunoprivilege properties of the MSC, their survival in the injured spinal cord is reduced due to the detrimental milieu in the damaged tissue and immune rejection of the cells. The limited survival of the engrafted cells may determine the therapy success. Therefore, we compared two strategies to increase the presence of the cells in the injured spinal cord in rats: increasing the amount of MSC transplants and using immunosuppressive treatment with FK506 after transplantation. Functional outcomes for locomotion and electrophysiological responses were assessed. The grafted cells survival and the amount of cavity and spared tissue were studied. The findings indicate that immunosuppression improved grafted cells survival. A cell-dose effect was found regarding locomotion recovery and tissue protection independent of immunosuppression. Nevertheless, immunosuppression enhanced the electrophysiological outcomes and allowed filling of the cavity formed after injury by new regenerative tissue and axons. These results indicate that MSC transplantation combined with immunosuppression prolongs the survival of engrafted cells and improves functional and morphological outcomes after SCI.","tacrolimus"

The model of spinal cord ischemia was prepared by means of catheterization through femoral artery and balloon dilatation. IR group underwent reperfusion 20 min after spinal cord ischemia. TP group experienced a single injection of tacrolimus (0.5 mg/kg) through the left common carotid artery at the onset of reperfusion. SO group received femoral artery catheterization only. Fluoro spectro photometry was employed to detect the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in injured spinal cord segment at 15 minutes after reperfusion. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were determined at 15 minutes, 1, 6, and 24 hours after reperfusion respectively. BBB scale was conducted to evaluate hindlimb motor function at 14 days after reperfusion. The level of ROS in TP group was significantly lower than that in IR group at 15 minutes after reperfusion. The activity of SOD was significantly higher in TP group than in IR group at all observational time points, while the activities of CAT and GSH-PX were significantly higher in TP group than in IR group at 1 and 6 hours after reperfusion.

These compounds alter immunophilin ligand signaling pathways, which are known to interact downstream with mediators for human neural stem cell (hNSC) differentiation and proliferation, suggesting that immunosuppressants may directly alter hNSC properties. We investigated whether immunosuppressants can exert direct effects on the differentiation, proliferation, survival, and migration of human central nervous system-derived stem cells propagated as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) in vitro and in an in vivo model of spinal cord injury. We identified unique, immunosuppressant-dependent effects on hCNS-SCns differentiation and proliferation in vitro. All immunosuppressants tested increased neuronal differentiation, and CsA and rapamycin inhibited proliferation in vitro. No immunosuppressant-mediated effects on hCNS-SCns survival or migration in vitro were detected. These data suggested that immunosuppressant administration could alter hCNS-SCns properties in vivo. We tested this hypothesis by administering immunosuppressants to constitutively immunodeficient spinal cord injured mice and assessed survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of hCNS-SCns after 14 weeks. In parallel, we administered immunosuppressants to immunocompetent spinal cord injury (SCI) mice and also evaluated hCNS-SCns engraftment and fate. We identified no effect of immunosuppressants on the overall hCNS-SCns fate profile in either xenotransplantation model. Despite a lower level of human cell engraftment in immunocompetent SCI mice, functional locomotor recovery was observed in animals receiving hCNS-SCns transplantation with no evidence of allodynia. These data suggest that local cues in the microenvironment could exert a stronger influence on hCNS-SCns than circulating levels of immunosuppressants; however, differences between human and rodent metabolism/pharmokinetics and xenograft versus allograft paradigms could be determining factors.","tacrolimus"

At the end-point, gait (CatWalk), ladder climbing, and single frame analyses were also assessed. Syrinx size, spinal cord dimensions, and extent of scarring were measured by magnetic resonance imaging.

Intraspinal grafting of HSSC led to a progressive and significant improvement in lower extremity paw placement, amelioration of spasticity, and normalization in thermal and tactile pain/escape thresholds at eight weeks post-grafting. No significant differences were detected in other CatWalk parameters, motor evoked potentials, open field locomotor (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotion score (BBB)) score or ladder climbing test. Magnetic resonance imaging volume reconstruction and immunofluorescence analysis of grafted cell survival showed near complete injury-cavity-filling by grafted cells and development of putative GABA-ergic synapses between grafted and host neurons.

This study was to determine whether the combination of FTY720 and tacrolimus is superior to FTY720 or tacrolimus alone in the treatment of SCI. Forty-eight rats were subjected to a weight-drop contusion at the tenth thoracic level (a 10-g rod dropped from a height of 25 mm).

Functional recovery was evaluated during 42 days after SCI via open-field test, inclined plane test, footprint analysis, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and electron microscopic analysis. Rats from three treatment groups showed significantly better locomotor functional outcomes, higher SSEP amplitude, shorter SSEP latency, and milder pathological changes compared with those of control group. Moreover, rats treated with a combination of FTY720 and tacrolimus demonstrated significantly greater functional recovery by day 14 after SCI than those treated with either FTY720 or tacrolimus alone.

The area of the preserved spinal cord tissue within a 13 mm segment of the spinal cord (lesion epicenter and 6 mm rostral-caudal) was examined histologically. The results showed no significant effects of FK506 on spinal cord tissue sparing or improvement of locomotor recovery. However, body weight fell significantly (P < 0.05) with FK506 treatment when compared with placebo from day 7 until sacrifice. In our experimental design, long-term FK506 treatment did not affect the parameters of outcome following balloon-compression SCI in the rat; however, multiple effects of FK506 should be taken into account when evaluating the outcomes in transplantation studies.","tacrolimus"

FK1706, a non-immunosuppressant neurophilin ligand, potentiates nerve growth factor signaling, suggesting therapeutic potential for functional deficits following spinal cord injury. Here, we demonstrate that FK1706 significantly improves behavioral outcomes in animal models of spinal cord hemisection and contusion injuries in rats. Furthermore, we show that FK1706 is effective even if administration is delayed until 1 week after injury, suggesting that FK1706 has a reasonable therapeutic time-window. Morphological analysis of injured axons in the dorsal corticospinal tract showed an increase in the radius and perimeter of stained axons, which were reduced by FK1706 treatment, suggesting that axonal swelling and retraction balls observed in injured spinal cord were improved by the neurotrophic effect of FK1706. Taken together, FK1706 improves both behavioral motor function and the underlying morphological changes, suggesting that FK1706 may have therapeutic potential in meeting the significant unmet needs in spinal cord injury.","tacrolimus"

Seventy-two male rats were divided randomly into three groups: the sham-operation group, the injury group and the group treated with tacrolimus, and the latter two groups were SCI with a weight-drop impactor at the T(10) vertebrae level (10 g weight was dropped from a 4.0 cm height). The tacrolimus group was injected with tacrolimus 5 minutes after SCI, while the other groups received 0.9% saline likewise. The inclined plate and BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scales were used to evaluate hindlimb neurological function. The expression of HSP 70 mRNA after SCI was detected by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry staining was performed to determine the protein expression of HSP 70 and Caspase-3. The apoptosis of neural cells was assessed with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuredine triphosphate-digoxin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Compared with the injury group, the expression of HSP 70 was significantly higher in the tacrolimus group, and the peak expression of HSP 70 mRNA and protein was respectively observed at 6, 24 h after SCI. Caspase-3-positive or TUNEL-positive cells were significantly less in the tacrolimus group than in the injury group. Neurological function score of the tacrolimus group was significantly better than that of the injury group. Tacrolimus may inhibit activity of Caspase-3, attenuate apoptosis of neural cells and ameliorate neurological function recovery after SCI by inducing high expression of HSP 70.","tacrolimus"

In partial spinal cord injury, combination of an OEC graft and FK506 reduced functional deficits evaluated by the BBB score, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and H reflex tests, diminished cavitation, astrogliosis and increased sparing/regeneration of raphespinal fibers compared to untreated and single-treatment groups of rats. After complete spinal cord transection, the combined treatment significantly improved functional outcomes, promoted axonal regeneration caudal to the lesion, and diminished astrogliosis compared only to non-transplanted animals. Slightly, but non-significant, better functional and histological results were found in OEC-grafted animals treated with FK506 than in those given saline after spinal cord transection. Nevertheless, the combined treatment increased the percentage of rats that recovered MEPs and promoted a significant reduction in astrogliosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that OEC grafts combined with FK506 promote additive repair of spinal cord injuries to those exerted by single treatments, the effect being more remarkable when the spinal cord is partially lesioned.","tacrolimus"

In this study, the authors evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive medications on neurite outgrowth and cell survival after a pharmacologically induced injury. Differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were injured using the calcium agonist thapsigargin. After cellular injury, neurite outgrowth in the presence or absence of immunosuppressive agents was measured. Apoptosis was quantified with the aid of a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay. Neurite outgrowth was severely restricted following thapsigargin injury. Outgrowth was potentiated, however, by the addition of concentrations of 1 and 10 mM cyclosporin A in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, addition of 10 nM FK506 increased the percentage of neurites in the 20- to 40-micron range. A low dose (1 mM) of dexamethasone did not have a significant effect on neurite outgrowth, but a higher dose (10 mM) increased the percentage of neurites in the 10- to 45-micron range. These agents also lessened the degree of thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and dexamethasone can potentiate neurite outgrowth and protect against apoptotic cell death in a human postmitotic neuronal cell line. Such effects may have implications for lessening neuronal injury after neurotrauma, stroke, or neurodegeneration.","tacrolimus"

An additional group received an initial bolus of FK 506 (2 mg/kg) followed by daily injections (0.2 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Functional recovery was evaluated using open-field walking, inclined plane tests, motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and the H-reflex response during 14 days postoperation (dpo). Tissue sparing and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), biotinylated tomato lectin LEC, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) immunoreactivity were quantified in the injured spinal cord. FK 506-treated animals demonstrated significantly better neurologic outcome, higher MEP amplitudes, and lower H-wave amplitude compared to that of saline-treated rats. In contrast, administration of MP did not result in significant differences with respect to the saline-treated group. Histologic examination revealed that tissue sparing was largest in FK 506-treated compared to saline and MP-treated animals. GFAP and COX-2 reactivity was decreased in animals treated with FK 506 compared to that in animals given MP or saline, whereas IL-1 beta expression was similarly reduced in both FK 506- and MP-treated groups.

Peripheral nerve damage also leads to permanent neurological deficits, but neurological recovery can be relatively good, especially if the ends of a transected nerve are anastomosed soon after the injury. The time until recovery generally depends on the distance the axons must regenerate to their targets. Neurological recovery following the destruction of a length of a peripheral nerve requires a graft to bridge the gap that is permissive to, and promotes, axon regeneration. But neurological recovery is slow and limited, especially for gaps longer than 1.5 cm, even using autologous peripheral nerve grafts. Without a reliable means of bridging long nerve gaps, such injuries commonly result in amputations. Promoting extensive neurological recovery requires techniques that simultaneously provide protection to injured neurons and increase the numbers of neurons that extend axons, while inducing more rapid and extensive axon regeneration across long nerve gaps. Although conduits filled with various materials enhance axon regeneration across short nerve gaps, pure sensory nerve graft remains the gold standard for use across long nerve gaps, even though they lead to only limited neurological recovery. Consistent results demonstrate that several immunosuppressive agents enhance the number of axons and the rate at which they regenerate. This review examines the roles played by immunosuppressants, especially FK506, with primary focus on its role as a neuroprotectant and neurotrophic agent, and its potential clinical use to promote improved neurological recovery following peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries.","tacrolimus"

The specific pathways in this cascade are myriad and the importance each one plays is controversial. It is clear, though, that blocking individual pathways confers protection to these tissues. In the present study we examined the role of Cyclosporin A (CsA), FK-506 and rapamycin in modulating the effects of Ca(2+) influx through their interactions with immunophilins and specifically the end result of calcineurin modulation. Dorsal columns were isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats and injured by exposure to hypoxic conditions for 60 minutes. The samples were monitored electrophysiologically in an in vitro recording chamber (maintained at 37 C degrees ) during injury, and the compound action potential (CAP) was monitored with glass microelectrodes. The dorsal column was exposed to hypoxic Ringers solution alone or with the different immunosuppressants and compared with baseline readings. Functional recovery of the dorsal column was then assessed by recovery of the CAP. The mean CAP decreased to about 20% of baseline control levels during hypoxia and returned 53.8+/-7.6% of baseline (p<.05) after reoxygenation. CsA, an immunosuppressant known to inhibit calcineurin, promoted a significantly greater recovery of CAP amplitude to 76.8+/-5.2% and 72.1+/-13.2% of control (p<.05) after hypoxic injury and reoxygenation of dorsal column white matter when applied at concentrations of 1 microM and 10 microM, respectively. FK-506, which also inhibits calcineurin, was applied at a concentration of 0.1 microM, and promoted CAP amplitude recovery to 82.6+/-5.0% of control after hypoxic injury and reoxygenation of dorsal column white matter. The addition of rapamycin (1 microM), which binds to the same immunophilin as FK-506, to the FK-506 (0.1 microM) solution during hypoxic injury showed recovery of CAP amplitudes to only 56.9+/-6.7% of control. Electron microscopy revealed remarkable protection of axons and prevention of organelle disruption in segments treated with CsA and FK-506 during hypoxia when compared with hypoxic controls. In conclusion, both CsA and FK-506 confer in vitro protection to dorsal columns during hypoxic injury at physiological temperatures, and rapamycin blocks the protective effect of FK-506. Thus, calcineurin may play an important role in the physiology of neuronal injury.","tacrolimus"

Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment.

Nitric oxide (NO) functions as a retrograde neurotransmitter in the spinal cord, and postsynaptic structures respond to NO by producing cGMP. The concentrations of cGMP in the spinal cord are controlled by the actions of PDE. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the effects of the use of both methylprednisolone and tadalafil on serum and tissue concentrations of NO, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and tissue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in Wistar albino rats by dropping a 10 g rod from a 5.0 cm height at T8-10. The 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: tadalafil, methylprednisolone, non-treatment and sham groups. Rats were neurologically tested at 24 hours after trauma. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p<0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p<0.05). The increase in serum SOD levels was greater in the tadalafil group than the methylprednisolone group. Serum MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group (p>0.05). Tissue MDA levels in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group and sham groups (p>0.05). Although there was no difference in neurological outcome scores between the tadalafil, methylprednisolone and non-treatment groups (p>0.05), the animals in the tadalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to have better scores than the non-treatment group. Thus, tadalafil appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of injury to the spinal cord by increasing tissue levels of NO and serum activity of SOD.","tadalafil"

Analysis of literature on oral PDE5 inhibitors in individuals with SCI and ED in order to evaluate how much their release changed the management of ED in SCI subjects and what remains to be seen of their potential or limits. Questionnaires on sexual function. 18 internationally published clinical studies that enrolled SCI males treated with at least one of the PDE5 inhibitors were analyzed. The small numbers of papers with large and diverse outcome measures did not consent a meta-analysis of treatment results. 705 used sildenafil, 305 vardenafil and 224 tadalafil. Median age was less than 40 years. Only 1 study excluded tetraplegic individuals. For measures of ED evaluated, 11 out of 13 studies reported a significant statistical improvement with PDE5 inhibitors versus placebo or erectile baseline (P < 0.01, or p < 0.005). The most frequent predicable factor for the therapeutic success of PDE5 inhibitors was upper motoneuron lesion. Statistical impact on ejaculation success rates was shown in at least one paper for all PDE5 inhibitors (p < 0.05). Overall, 15 patients, (7 using sildenafil), discontinued the therapies due to drawbacks. Only 1 sildenafil study reported a follow-up maximum of 24 months. Literature suggests that all oral PDE5 inhibitors represent a safe and effective treatment option for ED caused by SCI. Further research is needed on head-to-head comparative trials and SCI patient preference for these drugs; their impact on ejaculation and orgasm function, their early use after SCI for increasing the recovery rate of a spontaneous erection, and their effectiveness and tolerability in the long-term are still to be investigated.","tadalafil"

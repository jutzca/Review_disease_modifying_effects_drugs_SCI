The aim of this study was to probe the effect of metabolic inhibition after an acute traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) using a standardized contusion model (NYU impactor) to know whether the metabolic inhibition is a 'secondary mechanism of injury' or a mechanism of protection. All experimental procedures were carried out in the Mexico City. Animals were divided into five groups: one sham and four with TSCI, including no treatment, rotenone (inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I), sodium azide (inhibitor of mitochondrial complex IV) and pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase as a metabolic reactivator. After TSCI, the metabolic inhibition with sodium azide treatment diminished the lipid peroxidation process (malondialdehyde levels by spectrophotometric procedures) and the damage to the spinal cord tissue (morphometric analysis), and increased the activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase enzymes (P<0.05) (measured by spectrophotometric procedures 24 h after TSCI as well as after the functional recovery of the hind limb (evaluated weekly for 2 months by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale)) when compared with the TSCI group without treatment. The results show that the partial and transitory inhibition of the aerobic metabolism after an acute TSCI could be a self-protection mechanism instead of being a 'secondary mechanism of injury'.","thiamine"

In order to prove if early metabolic reactivation is a better therapeutic option than antioxidant therapy in the acute phase of TSCI, spinal cord contusions were performed in adult rats using a well-characterized weight drop technique at thoracic 9 level. After TSCI, pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase (NDC) enzyme was used to maintain energy levels, antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and catalase (ANT) were used to decrease oxidative damage and methylprednisolone (MP), which has both therapeutic properties, was used as a control. Rats were divided into one sham group and six with TSCI; one of them received no treatment, and the rest were treated with NDC, MP, NDC + MP, NDC + ANT or ANT. The ANT group decreased lactate and creatine phosphokinase levels and increased the amount of preserved tissue (morphometric analysis) as well as functional recovery (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan or BBB motor scale). In contrast, NDC treatment increased lipid peroxidation, measured through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, as well as spinal cord tissue destruction and functional deficit. Early metabolic reactivation after a TSCI may be deleterious, while natural early metabolic inhibition may not be a ""secondary mechanism of injury"" but a ""secondary neuroprotective response"". While increased antioxidant defence after a TSCI may currently be an ideal therapeutic strategy, the usefulness of metabolic reactivation should be tested in the sub-acute or chronic phases of TSCI and new strategies must continue to be tested for the early ones.","thiamine"

Although troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate (TCH) injections have been extensively used in clinics in China for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cerebral stroke, the potential efficacy of TCH injection in the treatment of SCI has never been revealed. In this study, the effects of administering TCH injections on neurological recovery in post-SCI rats were first tested with regard to the behavior and histology; subsequently, the specific expression profile of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) in their spinal cords were conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The LncRNA-mRNA networks were also elucidated. After SCI, we found that TCH injection with the right dose is effective for the recovery of locomotion function and repairing of the damaged tissue in the spinal cord; TCH injection is also discovered to have a role in the regulation of 443 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 27 differentially expressed LncRNAs (DELs) that are identified to have multiple functions, including locomotion, blood vessel morphogenesis, thiamine metabolism, Hippo signaling pathway, and axon guidance, by applying the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. In addition, it is revealed that, after SCI, the highly expressed LncRNA AABR07071383.1 in the post-SCI cis/trans-regulates the expression of mRNA Acpp mRNA that encodes a key enzyme involved in the metabolic process of thiamine in the abirritation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which implies that TCH injection may be more effective when administered with benfotiamine (a common treatment drug).","thiamine"

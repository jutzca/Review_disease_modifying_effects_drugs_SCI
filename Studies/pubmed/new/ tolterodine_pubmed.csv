Our primary aim was to compare rectal compliance before and after the institution of anti-muscarinics (solifenacin and tolterodine) and an adrenoceptor agonist (mirabegron) in these patients. Additionally, we wanted to evaluate if anorectal manometry differed before and after use of anti-muscarinic agents. Tertiary neurogastroenterology clinic, London METHODS: Thirty-five patients with supraconal spinal cord injury (SCI) underwent anal manometry, assessment of rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) and rectal compliance before and after anti-muscarinic treatment (for overactive bladder) was started (mean follow-up 12 weeks). Patients were assessed identically, pre-and post-treatment (solifenacin n = 17, tolterodine n = 10, mirabegron n = 8). Doses used were as for non-SCI patients. Resting, squeeze and cough pressures were unchanged after anti-muscarinic treatment. Rectal compliance was significantly raised after anti-muscarinic treatment (p = 0.001). The percent amplitude of maximal sphincter relaxation of the RAIR was decreased (p < 0.001) and excitation latency was increased (p = 0.006). There was no significant change in the duration of recovery of the RAIR. There was a significant increase of the Wexner Constipation Score (p = 0.001) but no change in the Wexner Incontinence Score. There was a significant correlation between change in rectal compliance and change in Wexner Constipation Score (p = 0.001). Thus, increasing compliance of the rectum is associated with worsening of constipation after anti-muscarinic therapy. However, there were no changes in anorectal manometry or rectal compliance in those who received mirabegron. Anti-muscarinic therapy for overactive bladder increases compliance of the neurogenic rectum and alters anorectal reflex activity, with worsening of constipation.","tolterodine"

Fifteen consecutive neurologically impaired patients (8 from multiple sclerosis, 4 from spinal cord injury, 3 from other causes) with complications of previous bladder management underwent ileovesicostomy. There were 10 women and 5 men. All patients were either poor candidates for or refused continent urinary diversion or bladder augmentation cystoplasty. At a mean follow-up of 23.2 months, 14 of 15 patients had low-pressure urine drainage through their ileovesicostomy. Four women with documented preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia had postoperative intermittent mild urge incontinence per native urethra. They did not require any further treatment, except for oral anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin and tolterodine). Because of persistent severe urge incontinence, 1 woman required conversion of her ileovesicostomy to an ileal conduit with concurrent cystectomy. The ileovesicostomy of another myelodysplastic man who had four failed artificial urinary sphincters in the past was also converted to an ileal conduit because of persistent urethroperineal fistula despite perineal urethral closure. Renal function was preserved in all patients. Long-term complications were stomal stenosis in 2 patients, bladder and kidney stone formation in 5, and symptomatic urinary tract infections in 3. Ileovesicostomy can be safely performed in neurologically impaired women and men. Severe preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary. In addition, in cases of neural recovery, the ileal ""chimney"" can be excised and the patient's original lower urinary tract would be preserved.","tolterodine"

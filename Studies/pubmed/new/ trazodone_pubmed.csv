Previous studies in animal models with SCI have demonstrated a promising recovery in respiratory and phrenic nerve activity post-injury induced by the systemic and local administration of serotonin receptor agonists such as Buspirone and Trazodone. Human trials must be performed to determine whether individuals with SCI respond similarly. We hypothesized that Buspirone and Trazodone would decrease the propensity to hypocapnic CSA during sleep. We studied eight males with chronic SCI and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [age: 48.8 ± 14.2 yr; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 44.9 ± 23.1] in a single-blind crossover design. For 13 days, participants were randomly assigned either Buspirone (7.5-15 mg twice daily), Trazodone (100 mg), or a placebo followed by a 14-day washout period before crossing over to the other interventions. Study nights included polysomnography and induction of CSA using a noninvasive ventilation protocol. We assessed indexes of SDB, CO2 reserve, apneic threshold (AT), controller gain (CG), plant gain (PG), and ventilatory parameters. CO2 reserve was significantly widened on Buspirone (-3.6 ± 0.9 mmHg) compared with both Trazodone (-2.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.009) and placebo (-1.8 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.001) but not on Trazodone vs. placebo (P = 0.061). CG was significantly decreased on Buspirone compared with placebo (1.8 ± 0.4 vs. 4.0 ± 2.0 L/(mmHg·min), P = 0.025) but not on Trazodone compared with placebo (2.5 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0 ± 2.0 L/(mmHg·min); P = 0.065). There were no significant differences for PG, AT, or any SDB indexes (AHI, obstructive apnea index, central apnea index, oxygen desaturation index). The administration of Buspirone decreased the susceptibility to induced hypocapnic central apnea by reducing chemosensitivity and increasing CO2 reserve in chronic SCI patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research study is novel as it is the first study in a humans that we are aware of that demonstrates the ability of Buspirone to increase CO2 reserve and hence decrease susceptibility to hypocapnic central apnea in patients with spinal cord injury.","trazodone"

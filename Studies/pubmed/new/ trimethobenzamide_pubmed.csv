The drugs investigated included: a. amphetamine, b. diazepam, c. dimenhydrinate, d. scopolamine, and e. trimethobenzamide. The most beneficial drugs for improving recovery were a stimulant (amphetamine) and a general anti-emetic (trimethobenzamide). It is postulated they had this effect by improving the overall activity level with general exercise being a known positive influence. Conversely the other drugs either had little effect on recovery or hindered it, by presumably suppressing the sensory imbalance in the vestibular system that is essential stimulus to ultimate recovery.","trimethobenzamide"

However, the effects of valproic acid-labeled chitosan nanoparticles (VA-CN) on endogenous spinal cord neural stem cells (NSCs) following SCI and the underlying mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. In this study, the VA-CN was constructed and the effects of VA-CN on NSCs were assessed in a rat model of SCI. We found VA-CN treatment promoted recovery of the tissue and locomotive function following SCI. Moreover, administration of VA-CN significantly enhanced neural stem cell proliferation and the expression levels of neurotrophic factors following SCI. Furthermore, administration of VA-CN led to a decrease in the number of microglia following SCI. In addition, VA-CN treatment significantly increased the Tuj 1- positive cells in the spinal cord of the SCI rats, suggesting that VA-CN could enhance the differentiation of NSCs following SCI. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that VA-CN could improve the functional and histological recovery through promoting the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs following SCI, which would provide a newly potential therapeutic manner for the treatment of SCI.","valproic_acid"

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic injury resulting in loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function distal from the level of injury. An appropriate combination of biomaterials and bioactive substances is currently thought to be a promising approach to treat this condition. Systemic administration of valproic acid (VPA) has been previously shown to promote functional recovery in animal models of SCI. In this study, VPA was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microfibers by the coaxial electrospinning technique. Fibers showed continuous and cylindrical morphology, randomly oriented fibers, and compatible morphological and mechanical characteristics for application in SCI. Drug-release analysis indicated a rapid release of VPA during the first day of the in vitro test. The coaxial fibers containing VPA supported adhesion, viability, and proliferation of PC12 cells. In addition, the VPA/PLGA microfibers induced the reduction of PC12 cell viability, as has already been described in the literature. The biomaterials were implanted in rats after SCI. The groups that received the implants did not show increased functional recovery or tissue regeneration compared to the control. These results indicated the cytocompatibility of the VPA/PLGA core-shell microfibers and that it may be a promising approach to treat SCI when combined with other strategies.","valproic_acid"

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects. The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes.","valproic_acid"

Here the contusion was induced in organotypic spinal cord slice culture at day seven in vitro using a weight drop device and one hour post injury the GFP- expressing EPI-NCSCs were grafted followed by VPA administration. The evaluation of treated slices seven days after injury revealed that grafted stem cells survived on the injured slices and expressed GFAP, whereas they did not express any detectable levels of the neural progenitor marker doublecortin (DCX), which was expressed prior to transplantation. Immunoblotting data demonstrated that the expression of GFAP, BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NT3), and Bcl2 increased significantly in stem cell treated slices. This study illustrated that the fate of transplanted stem cells has been directed to the glial lineage in the ex vivo context of injury and EPI-NCSCs may ameliorate the SCI condition through releasing neurotrophic factors directly and/or via inducing resident spinal cord cells.","valproic_acid"

A total of 30 rats were randomly allocated to 3 groups: sham, control, and VPA. The rats in the VPA and control groups received laminectomy at the L4 level of the vertebrae and silicone gel implantation into the epidural spaces L5 and L6. Rats in the sham group only received laminectomy at the L4 level of vertebrae without any implantation. VPA (300 mg/kg in saline) was administered 2 hours before the surgery. After the surgery, the VPA group received further VPA injections at 300 mg/kg twice a day for 1 week. The same volume of saline was injected in the control group. Neurobehavioral tests using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scale and the oblique board test were performed for 1 week starting at 2 hours before surgery up to day 7 after surgery. At day 7 after surgery, tissues from the compressed cauda equina (L5-L6) were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin, luxol fast blue, or immunofluorescence staining, whereas the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick-end label assay staining was performed on the tissue from the dorsal root ganglions and the lumbar segment of the spinal cord proximal to the compressed cauda equina (L5-L6). The behavioral results suggested a significant improvement in the lower limb motor function in the VPA group compared with controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, histologic assessment revealed a significant reduction in nerve fibers showing Wallerian degeneration and demyelinating lesions in the VPA group, in addition to an increased myelination compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

Using the digital image-analysis system, thickness of the myelin sheath was measured, and total numbers of regenerated axons were counted. There was a significant difference in SFI, electrophysiological index (motor-nerve conduct velocity), and morphometrical results (regenerated axon number and thickness of myelin sheath) in nerve regeneration between the VPA group and controls (P<0.05).

To elucidate the effects of VPA on regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons, we examined the in vivo effects of oral VPA administration on recovery from methimazole-induced degeneration of olfactory neuroepithelium in mice. Male ICR mice (10 weeks old) were intraperitoneally injected with methimazole (75 mg/kg), an olfactory toxic reagent, to induce degenerative changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium. The effects of daily VPA administration on recovery from methimazole-induced changes were examined histologically. Oral VPA administration dose dependently enhanced increases in epithelial thickness and number of olfactory marker protein (OMP) positive cells in the olfactory epithelium during recovery from methimazole-induced degeneration. VPA also enhanced early increases in the number of Ki-67(+) and growth-associated protein-43(+) cells during the regeneration of olfactory neuroepithelium. VPA administration promotes regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons in damaged neuroepithelium by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of olfactory precursor cells.

Here, we examined whether valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, would attenuate BSCB disruption by inhibiting MMP-9 activity, leading to improvement of functional outcome after SCI. After moderate spinal cord contusion injury at T9, VPA (300 mg/kg) were immediately injected subcutaneously and further injected every 12 h for 5 days. Our data show that VPA inhibited MMP-9 activity after injury, and attenuated BSCB permeability and degradation of tight junction molecules such as occludin and ZO-1.

We previously reported that degeneration of oligodendrocytes and neurons that occurs after SCI is associated with the development of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the progressive accumulation of the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP. Since following ER stress, the balance between the pro-survival chaperone BiP and CHOP drives the cell destiny, we aimed to find drugs that modulate this ratio in favour of the former. We found that valproate (VPA) induced a significant reduction of CHOP levels after ER stress in an organotypic-based culture of spinal cord in vitro. We then administered different doses of VPA to rats following spinal cord contusion, and found that the treatment caused a marked reduction of CHOP levels early after the lesion. In addition, VPA administration partially prevented cord tissue, myelin and axonal loss, and significantly increased the relative number of surviving oligodendrocytes in the damaged spinal cord. Besides, VPA-treated rats showed better recovery of the locomotor activity than vehicle-treated rats after SCI. Since VPA is a drug already in clinical use, these results open the avenue for its therapeutical use in SCI as well as in demyelinating disorders.","valproic_acid"

Although various treatment regimens can partially alleviate spinal cord injury (SCI), the mechanisms responsible for symptomatic improvement remain elusive. Here, using a mouse model of SCI, we have shown that transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) together with administration of valproic acid (VPA), a known antiepileptic and histone deacetylase inhibitor, dramatically enhanced the restoration of hind limb function. VPA treatment promoted the differentiation of transplanted NSCs into neurons rather than glial cells. Transsynaptic anterograde corticospinal tract tracing revealed that transplant-derived neurons reconstructed broken neuronal circuits, and electron microscopic analysis revealed that the transplant-derived neurons both received and sent synaptic connections to endogenous neurons. Ablation of the transplanted cells abolished the recovery of hind limb motor function, confirming that NSC transplantation directly contributed to restored motor function. These findings raise the possibility that epigenetic status in transplanted NSCs can be manipulated to provide effective treatment for SCI.","valproic_acid"

It has recently been demonstrated that VPA could promote neurite outgrowth, activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, and increase B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2)and growth cone-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) levels in spinal cord. We hypothesized that VPA could enhance axonal regeneration in the rat. In the present research, we demonstrate the effect of VPA on peripheral nerve regeneration and recovery of motor function through a silicon tube implanted with VPA. The left sciatic nerves were exposed through dorsal-splitting incisions, and 8-mm nerve sections were excised at the middle of the thigh. Then, a 1.0-cm-long silicone tube (internal diameter,1.0 mm; exterior diameter, 2.0 mm) was used to bridge the nerve deficit, anchored to the proximal and distal terminals of the excised deficit of sciatic nerves with 9-0 nylon epineural suture. Sterile petroleum jelly was used to seal the ends of the tubes to avoid leakage. The rats in the VPA group and control group were locally delivered 10 muL VPA injection (400 mg/5 mL) and normal saline, respectively, after the operation. The sciatic nerve index (SFI) was observed in each animal at 2-week intervals and electrophysiology was studied at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. Histological and morphometrical analyses were performed at the end of the experiment (12 weeks after the operation). Using the digital image-analysis system, the thickness of the myelin sheath was measured, and total numbers of regenerated axons were counted. There was a significant difference in SFI, electrophysiological index (motor-nerve conduct velocity, amplitude of activity potential), and morphometrical results (regenerated axon number and thickness of myelin sheath) in nerve regeneration between the VPA group and controls ( P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that VPA is able to enhance sciatic nerve regeneration in rats, suggesting the potential clinical application of VPA for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury in humans.","valproic_acid"

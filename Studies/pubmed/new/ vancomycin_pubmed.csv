Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-B agonist that acts on the central nervous system, is the drug most widely used to treat spasticity. Baclofen overdose is a potentially deadly condition that can cause encephalopathy and can result from multiple etiologies. Renal disease can contribute to baclofen overdose and encephalopathy, and there are currently no dosing recommendations for patient's on baclofen with renal impairment. We report an unusual case of a man aged 35 years who presented with persistent fevers, seizures, and normal mentation. The patient presented with intrathecal baclofen use and prior exposure to West Nile Virus. He developed acute kidney injury at hospital secondary to vancomycin use, and mental status declined. This case highlights that patients with baclofen overdose can initially appear to have serious brain injury, however, full patient recovery can occur in <72 hours. This case provides additional insight into the guidelines for the treatment and management for unknown cause encephalopathy. This case also highlights the link between renal disease, baclofen, and encephalopathy through a review of the literature.","vancomycin"

After a history of ineffective antimicrobial therapies, including metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, rifaximin and tigecycline, leading to several relapses, the patient underwent colonoscopic fecal microbiota transplantation from his healthy son. Four days subsequent to the procedure, the patient showed a systemic inflammation response syndrome. Without detecting an infectious cause, the patient received antimicrobial treatment, including tigecycline, metronidazole, vancomycin via polyethylene glycol and an additional enema for a period of seven days, leading to a prompt recovery and no reported C. difficile infection relapse during a 12 wk follow up.","vancomycin"

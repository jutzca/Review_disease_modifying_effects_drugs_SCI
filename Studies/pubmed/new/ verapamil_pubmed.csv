To examine the relevance of these findings to neurotrauma, we conducted electrophysiological studies with inorganic Ca(2+) channels blockers and L- and N-subtype-specific calcium channel antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury. Confocal immunohistochemistry was used to examine for localization of L- and N-type calcium channels in spinal cord white matter tracts. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber and injured with a modified clip (2g closing force) for 15s. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential at two points with glass microelectrodes. The compound action potential decreased to 71.4+/-2.0% of control (P<0. 05) after spinal cord injury. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) promoted significantly greater recovery of compound action potential amplitude (86.3+/-7.6% of control; P< 0.05) after injury. Partial blockade of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels with cobalt (20 microM) or cadmium (200 microM) conferred improvement in compound action potential amplitude. Application of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers diltiazem (50 microM) or verapamil (90 microM), and the N-type antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM), significantly enhanced the recovery of compound action potential amplitude postinjury. Co-application of the L-type antagonist diltiazem with the N-type blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA showed significantly greater (P<0.05) improvement in compound action potential amplitude than application of either drug alone. Confocal immunohistochemistry with double labelling for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GalC and NF200 demonstrated L- and N-type Ca(2+) channels on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not axons, in spinal cord white matter. In conclusion, the injurious effects of Ca(2+) in traumatic central nervous system white matter injury appear to be partially mediated by voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. The presence of L- and N-type Ca(2+) channels on periaxonal astrocytes and oligodendrocytes suggests a role for these cells in post-traumatic axonal conduction failure.","verapamil"

The traumatised spinal segment and the adjoining upper segment were used for biochemical estimations. Motor function of the injured rats was evaluated using the inclined plane. Phospholipid phosphorus values were significantly decreased in the injured spinal segment at 24 hrs. AchE activity was also decreased in the traumatised segment one week after injury. Dexamethasone and verapamil reversed the changes in AchE activity at the end of one week. At the one week assessment period, aneurysm clipped rats showed a decrease in the maximum angle in the inclined plane. Dexamethasone and verapamil treated rats showed improvement in the neurologic function, neurologic recovery was better in the dexamethasone treated group.","verapamil"

This Na+ leak likely occurs via incompletely inactivated voltage-gated Na+ channels. This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 microM were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (< or = 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 microM), disopyramide (10-300 microM) and bupivacaine (10-100 microM) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 microM. Procainamide (100-300 microM) was ineffective. These results suggest that Na+ channel blockers, including commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, may be effective in protecting central white matter, which is a target for anoxic/ischemic injury in diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury.","verapamil"

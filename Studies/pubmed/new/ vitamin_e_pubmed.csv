This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin C and vitamin E on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury in animal models. Two authors independently collected the records of relevant articles published in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science through November 2018. All studies conducted in animal models to evaluate the therapeutic effects of vitamin C or vitamin E or both on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury were included. Studies that lacked a control group or a standard treatment, lacked an assessment of motor function, included genetically modified/engineered animals, included animals pretreated with vitamin C or vitamin E, or combined vitamin treatment with other methods, such as cell therapies, were excluded. Data from 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Daily supplementation with vitamin C (P < 0.0001) and vitamin E (P < 0.0001) significantly improved the recovery of motor function in animals affected by spinal cord injury. Vitamin C supplementation is effective only when administered intraperitoneally (P < 0.0001). Concurrent supplementation with both vitamins does not show better efficacy than treatment with either one alone. Administration of vitamin C and vitamin E in animal models of spinal cord injury significantly improves the recovery of motor function.","vitamin_e"

A key component of SCI is the generation of free radicals that contributes to the high levels of oxidative stress observed. This study investigates whether dietary supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) improves functional recovery after SCI. Female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either with a normal diet or a dietary regiment supplemented with vitamin E (51 IU/g) for eight weeks. The rats were subsequently exposed either to a contusive SCI or sham operation, and evaluated using standard functional behavior analysis. We report that the rats that consumed the vitamin E-enriched diet showed an accelerated bladder recovery and significant improvements in locomotor function relative to controls, as determined by residual volumes and Basso, Beatie, and Bresnaham BBB scores, respectively. Interestingly, the prophylactic dietary intervention did not preserve neurons in the ventral horn of injured rats, but it significantly increased the numbers of oligodendrocytes. Vitamin E supplementation attenuated the depression of the H-reflex (a typical functional consequence of SCI) while increasing the levels of supraspinal serotonin immunoreactivity. Our findings support the potential complementary use of vitamin E to ameliorate sensory and autonomic dysfunctions associated with spinal cord injury, and identified promising new cellular and functional targets of its neuroprotective effects.","vitamin_e"

In the present study, experiments were carried out to evaluate the neuro-protective effect of the palm vitamin E on locomotor function and morphological damages induced SCI. Seventy-two male rats (Sprague-Dawley) were randomly divided into four groups: sham (laminectomy); control (supplemented with the palm vitamin E at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day); untreated-SCI (partial crush, 30-33% for 20 sec); treated-SCI (partial crush, 30-33% for 20 sec supplemented with the palm vitamin E at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day). The treatment with the palm vitamin E significantly improved the hind limb locomotor function, reduced the histopathological changes and the morphological damage in the spinal cord.

Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experimental procedure. In the sham group, laminectomy at T10 was performed, followed by impactor contusion of the spinal cord. In the control group, only a laminectomy was performed without contusion. Oxidative stress status was assessed by measuring the spinal cord tissue content of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and gluthatione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. We also evaluated the effects of combined VCE treatment using western blot to analyze expression of cleaved caspase-3 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale to evaluate functional outcomes. Combined treatment of VCE significantly counteracted the effects of spinal cord contusion on oxidative stress represented by activities of SOD and GSH-Px (P<0.05). The VCE treatment also significantly enhanced LC3-II expression and decreased cleaved caspase-3 compared with the sham (P<0.05). Furthermore, BBB scores significantly improved in the VCE-treated group compared with the sham group (on day 14 and 28 after SCI; P<0.05). The combined administration of VCE was clearly capable of modulating the antioxidant effects, and of reducing apoptosis and increasing autophagy at the lesion epicenter leading to an improved functional outcome.

Prolonged administration of vitamin E (alpha-TOL), as a potent biological antioxidant, may have a protective role in this oxidative inflammatory ischemic cascade to reduce the incidence of paraplegia. The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive value of alpha-TOL in IRI of spinal cord. For this study, 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into five experimental groups (n = 10): Control group (C); alpha-TOL control group (CE) which received intramuscular (i.m.) alpha-TOL injections (600 mg/kg); Sham operated group (S), IRI rats were subjected to laparotomy and clamping of the aorta just above the bifurcation for 45 min, then the clamp was released for 48 hrs for reperfusion; and IRIE rats group, received 600 mg/kg of alpha-TOL i.m. twice weekly for 6 weeks, followed by induction of IRI similar to the IRI group. At the end of the experimental protocol; motor, sensory and placing/stepping reflex evaluation was done. Plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx) was measured. Then animals' spinal cord lumbar segments were harvested and homogenized for measurement of the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation products (AOPP), while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity were evaluated. Induction of IRI in rats resulted in significant increases in plasma levels of nitrite/nitrate (p < 0.001) and spinal cord homogenate levels of PGE2, MDA, advanced oxidation protein products AOPP and SOD with significant reduction (p < 0.001) in CAT homogenate levels. Significant impairment of motor, sensory functions and placing/stepping reflex was observed with IRI induction in the spinal cord (p < 0.001). alpha-TOL administration in IRIE group significantly improved all the previously measured parameters compared with IRI group. alpha-TOL administration significantly prevents the damage caused by spinal cord IRI in rats with subsequent recovery of both motor and sensory functions. Alpha-tocopherol improves the oxidative stress level with subsequent reduction of the incidence of neurological deficits due to spinal cord IRI conditions.","vitamin_e"

After 30 days of aluminum treatment, the animals were subjected to spinal cord trauma. Laminectomy was performed at T7-8 in anesthetized rats, followed by placement of a compression plate (2.2 x 5 mm) loaded with a 35-g weight over the exposed spinal cord for 5 minutes. Control animals underwent the same surgical procedure, but the compression injury was not induced (sham). Postoperative neurological function was assessed using the inclined-plane test and by obtaining a modified Tarlov score and vocal/sensory score daily for 10 days. Electrophysiological changes were assessed using corticomotor evoked potentials, whereas pathological changes were assessed by light microscopy. The level of vitamin E in the spinal cord was measured as an index of antioxidant defense. The behavioral, biochemical, and histological analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. Analysis of results obtained in the behavioral studies revealed that the compression of spinal cord produced transient paraparesis in which a maximum motor deficit occurred at Day 1 following SCI and resolved over a period of 10 days. Administration of aluminum significantly impaired the recovery following SCI. Analysis of the results of the biochemical, electrophysiological, and histopathological studies also confirmed the deleterious effects of aluminum on recovery from SCI in rats.","vitamin_e"

Lipid peroxidation has been reported to play an important role in spinal cord injury. There is no report on the use of EPC-K1 to attenuate the severity of spinal cord injury in either animal or human studies. Spinal cord injury was induced by placing a 25-g weight on T12, and the animals were divided into six groups. Group 1 (sham) received only laminectomy. Group 2 (control) received spinal cord injury. Group 3 received EPC-K1 5 minutes before injury. Group 4 received it 5 minutes after injury. Group 5 received it 3 hours after injury. Group 6 received it five times, respectively: at 5 minutes, then 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after injury. The levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were measured in the spinal cord, and the recovery was assessed. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances content increased after injury, with two peaks, at 1 and 4 hours. Concentration at the 4-hour peak was lower in nitrogen mustard-induced leukocytopenia rats than in the control rats. The EPC-K1 injection reduced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances content at 1 and 4 hours after injury in Group 3 (respectively, 34.3% and 42.7% vs. control) and only that at 4 hours in Group 6 (24.9% vs. control).

Eight weeks after the treatment with streptozotocin the animals were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate and laminectomy was performed at T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) loaded with a weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed spinal cord for 5 min. Postoperative neurological function was assessed using inclined plane test, modified Tarlov score, and vocal and sensory score daily for 10 days. Electrophysiological changes were assessed using somatosensory and corticomotor evoked-potentials. The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals and injured site of the spinal cord was analyzed for changes in vitamin E and glutathione levels (as markers of oxidative stress). Pathological changes in spinal cord were also studied using light microscopy. The data on neurobehavioral study clearly indicated that the compression of spinal cord produced highly significant neurological deficit and poor recovery in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats. Our histopathological and electrophysiological results also confirmed that diabetic animals are more susceptible to compressive spinal cord injury as compared to nondiabetic animals. A higher depletion of antioxidant defense markers (vitamin E and glutathione) was observed in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats. These results point toward the role of free radicals in poor recovery in diabetic rats following neurotrauma. Further studies are warranted to assess the neuroprotective potential of antioxidants to retard the secondary pathophysiological events following neurotrauma and to enhance the recovery.","vitamin_e"

One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been selected for clinical evaluation as a cerebroprotective agent. In vitro studies suggest that tirilazad exerts its antioxidant activity by multiple mechanisms including: increasing membrane stability, scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals, reducing LP-induced arachidonic acid release, decreased formation or scavenging of hydroxyl radicals, and maintenance of the levels of endogenous vitamin E. The major site of action appears to be the blood-brain barrier based upon its known localization in cerebrovascular endothelium and numerous studies showing an attenuation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), injury, and ischemia-induced blood-brain barrier permeability. Tirilazad has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in multiple preclinical models of spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and focal cerebral ischemia, as measured by a decrease in cerebral vasospasm, blood-brain barrier compromise, post-traumatic ischemia, edema, ischemic neuronal necrosis and infarction, and improved neurological recovery. This efficacy is correlated with a reduction in markers of oxygen radical-induced LP. Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing in spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and ischemic stroke. Initial results from a European/Australian/New Zealand trial in SAH have shown a significant decrease in mortality and an increase in the incidence of good recovery.","vitamin_e"

Consequently, the purpose of this study was to test the capacity of alpha tocopherol, the major lipid antioxidant in cellular membranes and a compound that limits the injury-induced lipid hydrolysis and peroxidation in spinal cord tissue, to promote functional recovery in a static loading model of spinal cord injury. After laminectomy, the L2 spinal cord of cats was compressed with 180 g for 5 min.

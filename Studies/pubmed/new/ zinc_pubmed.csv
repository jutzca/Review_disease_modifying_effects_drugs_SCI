Regulating the inflammatory response can be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the prognosis of SCI. Zinc has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotective effect in experimental spinal cord injury models. In this study, we aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect of zinc through the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Allen's method was used to establish an SCI model in C57BL/6J mice. The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), Nissl staining were employed to confirm the protective effect of zinc on neuronal survival and functional recovery in vivo. Western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy-related proteins. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the occurrence of zinc-induced autophagy. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP polarized BV2 cells to a proinflammatory phenotype. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) were chosen to explore the relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. A coimmunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the ubiquitination of the NLRP3 protein. Our data showed that zinc significantly promoted motor function recovery after SCI. In vivo, zinc treatment inhibited the protein expression level of NLRP3 while increasing the level of autophagy. These effects were fully validated by the polarization of BV2 cells to a proinflammatory phenotype. The results showed that when 3-MA and BafA1 were applied, the promotion of autophagy by zinc was blocked and that the inhibitory effect of zinc on NLRP3 was reversed. Furthermore, co-IP confirmed that the promotion of autophagy by zinc also activated the protein expression of ubiquitin and suppressed high levels of NLRP3. Zinc provides neuroprotection by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome through autophagy and ubiquitination after SCI.","zinc"

The effects of zinc ions on neuronal cells were examined in a mouse SCI model and in vitro. In vivo, neurological function was assessed by Basso Mouse Scaleat (BMS) at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days after spinal cord injury. The number of neurons and histomorphology were observed by nissl staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE). The chromatin and mitochondrial structure of neurons were detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)-related antioxidant protein and NLRP3 inflammation-related protein were detected in vivo and in vitro by western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF), respectively. Zinc treatment promoted motor function recovery on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after SCI. In addition, zinc reduces the mitochondrial void rate in spinal neuronal cells and promotes neuronal recovery. At the same time, zinc reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde in spinal cord tissue after SCI, while increasing superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione peroxidase production. Zinc treatment resulted in up-regulation of Nrf2/Ho-1 levels and down-regulation of nlrp3 inflammation-associated protein expression in vitro and in vivo. Zinc has a protective effect on spinal cord injury by inhibiting oxidative damage and nlrp3 inflammation. Potential mechanisms may include activation of the Nrf 2/Ho-1 pathway to inhibit nlrp3 inflammation following spinal cord injury. Zinc has the potential to treat SCI.","zinc"

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the ectopic expression of Zfp521 reprograms fibroblasts and astrocytes into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). However, it remains unclear whether treatment with Zfp521 also affects endogenous astrocytes, thus promoting further functional recovery following SCI. Rat astrocytes were transdifferentiated into neural stem cells in vitro by ZFP521 or Sox2. Then, ZFP521 was applied to the spinal cord injury site of a rat. Transduction, real-time PCR, immunohistofluorescence, and function assessments were performed at 6 weeks post-transduction to evaluate improvement and in vivo lineage reprogramming of astrocytes. Here, we show that Zfp521 is more efficient in reprogramming cultured astrocytes compared with Sox2. In the injured spinal cord of an adult rat, resident astrocytes can be reprogrammed into neurons through a progenitor stage by Zfp521. Importantly, this treatment improves the functional abilities of the rats as evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and further by calculation of its subscores. There was enhanced locomotor activity in the hind limbs, step length, toe spread, foot length, and paw area. In addition, motor evoked potential recordings demonstrated the functional integrity of the spinal cord. These results have indicated that the generation of iNSCs or neurons from endogenous astrocytes by in situ reprogramming might be a potential strategy for SCI repair.","zinc"

The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of zinc and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on neuronal recovery after SCI. The SCI model was established by Allen's method. Injured animals were given glucose and zinc gluconate (ZnG; 30 mg/kg) for the first time at 2 h after injury, the same dose was given for 3 days. A cytokine antibody array was used to screen changes in inflammation at the site of SCI lesion. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the distribution of cytokines. Magnetic beads were also used to isolate cells from the site of SCI lesion. We then investigated the effect of Zinc on apoptosis after SCI by Transferase UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining and Western Blotting. Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores and immunofluorescence were employed to investigate neuronal apoptosis and functional recovery. We found that the administration of zinc significantly increased the expression of 19 cytokines in the SCI lesion. Of these, G-CSF was shown to be the most elevated cytokine and was secreted by microglia/macrophages (M/Ms) via the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway after SCI. Increased levels of G-CSF at the SCI lesion reduced the level of neuronal apoptosis after SCI, thus promoting functional recovery. Collectively, our results indicate that the administration of zinc increases the expression of G-CSF secreted by M/Ms, which then leads to reduced levels of neuronal apoptosis after SCI.","zinc"

Both neurodevelopment and the survival of neurons that are subject to stress depend on a regular selenoprotein biosynthesis and sufficient Se supply by selenoprotein P (SELENOP). Neuro-regeneration after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is related to the Se status. Single-centre prospective observational study. Three groups of patients with comparable injuries were studied; vertebral fractures without neurological impairment (n = 10, group C), patients with TSCI showing no remission (n = 9, group G0), and patients with remission developing positive abbreviated injury score (AIS) conversion within 3 months (n = 10, group G1). Serum samples were available from different time points (upon admission, and after 4, 9 and 12 h, 1 and 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months). Serum trace element concentrations were determined by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, SELENOP by ELISA, and further parameters by laboratory routine. Serum Se and SELENOP concentrations were higher on admission in the remission group (G1) as compared to G0. During the first week, both parameters remained constant in C and G0, whereas they declined significantly in the remission group. Similarly, the concentration changes between admission and 24 h were most pronounced in this group of recovering patients (G1). Binary logistic regression analysis including the delta of Se and SELENOP within the first 24 h indicated an AUC of 90.0% (CI: 67.4%-100.0%) with regards to predicting the outcome after TSCI. A Se deficit might constitute a risk factor for poor outcome after TSCI. A dynamic decline of serum Se and SELENOP concentrations after admission may reflect ongoing repair processes that are associated with higher odds for a positive clinical outcome.","zinc"

A total of 126 rats were divided into normal, sham, SCI, negative control (NC), PTC1-RNAi, PTC2-RNAi and PTC1/PTC2-RNAi groups. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale was employed to assess hind limb motor function. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to examine the mRNA and protein levels of PTC1, PTC2, Shh, glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli-1), Smo and Nestin. Tissue morphology was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent staining was conducted to detect neurofilament protein 200 (NF-200) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group displayed higher BBB scores than the SCI and NC groups. Shh, Gli-1, Smo and Nestin expression levels were elevated in the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group. PTC1 and PTC2 mRNA and protein expression was lower in the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group than in the normal, sham and SCI groups. Among the seven groups, the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group had the largest positive area of NF-200 staining, whereas the SCI group exhibited a larger GFAP-positive area than both the normal and the sham groups. The Shh pathway may provide new insights into therapeutic indications and regenerative recovery tools for the treatment of SCI. Activation of the Hh signaling pathway by silencing PTC1 and PTC2 may reduce inflammation and may ultimately promote SCI recovery.","zinc"

The secondary processes associated with the primary injury, such as overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation, lead to concomitant compression of the injured spinal cord and neuronal death. Delivery of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an efficient ROS scavenger, to the site of injury can mitigate SCI-induced oxidative stress and tissue damage. Towards this goal catalytically active nanoformulations of SOD1 (""nanozymes"") are developed as a modality for treatment of SCI. Along with the cross-linked polyion complex of SOD1 with polycation poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-polylysine (single-coat (SC) nanozyme), we introduce for the first time the chemically cross-linked multilayer polyion complex in which SOD1 is first incorporated into a polyion complex with polycation, then coated by anionic block copolymer, PEG-polyglutamic acid (double-coat (DC) nanozyme). We developed DC nanozymes with high enzymatic activity and ability to retain and protect SOD1 under physiological conditions. Pharmacokinetic study revealed that DC nanozymes significantly prolonged circulation of active SOD1 in the blood stream compared to free SOD1 or SC nanozymes (half-life was 60 vs 6min). Single intravenous injection of DC nanozymes (5kU of SOD1/kg) improved the recovery of locomotor functions in rats with moderate SCI, along with reduction of swelling, concomitant compression of the spinal cord and formation of post-traumatic cysts. Thus, based on the testing in a rodent model the SOD1 DC nanozymes are promising modality for scavenging ROS, decreasing inflammation and edema, and improving recovery after SCI.","zinc"

However, the protective function of Sal A on preserving the role of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) after spinal cord injury (SCI) is unclear. The present study investigated the effects and mechanisms of Sal A (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg, i.p.) on BSCB permeability at different time-points after compressive SCI in rats. Compared to the SCI group, treatment with Sal A decreased the content of the Evans blue in the spinal cord tissue at 24h post-SCI. The expression levels of tight junction proteins and HO-1 were remarkably increased, and that of p-caveolin-1 protein was greatly decreased after SCI Sal A. The effect of Sal A on the expression level of ZO-1, occluding, and p-caveolin-1 after SCI was blocked by the HO-1 inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP). Also, Sal A inhibited the level of apoptosis-related proteins and improved the motor function until 21days after SCI. In addition, Sal A significantly increased the expression of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in the RBMECs under hypoxia. AntagomiR-101 markedly increased the RBMECs permeability and the expression of the Cul3 protein by targeting with 3'-UTR of its mRNA. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and HO-1 was significantly increased after agomiR-101 treatment. Therefore, Sal A could improve the recovery of neurological function after SCI, which could be correlated with the repair of BSCB integrity by the miR-101/Cul3/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.","zinc"

Our results and other reports have shown that tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is able to exhibit neuro-protective effects after SCI. In the current study, we aimed to examine the possible mechanism underlying the neuro-protective effect of TMP in rat model of SCI. TMP improved locomotor functions and decreased permeability of blood-spinal cord barrier in rats with SCI, as evidenced by increase of Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores and decrease of Evans blue leakage. In addition, TMP decreased the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNFα and IL-18, reduced TUNEL-positive cells and caspase 3 and 9 activities, decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content and increased glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity in rats. All these effects were inhibited by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of HO-1, and LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt. Moreover, TMP inhibited the decrease of mRNA expression of HO-1 which was suppressed by ZnPP and LY294002. TMP inhibited the decrease of Akt phosphorylation in rats after SCI, which was suppressed by LY294002, but not ZnPP. Furthermore, LY294002, but not ZnPP, significantly inhibited TMP-induced increase of mRNA expression of Nrf2 and DNA binding activity of Nrf2 in HO-1 promoters in rat model of SCI. The data suggested that TMP induced neuro-protective effects against injury of spinal cord through the activation of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These results have appointed a new path toward the understanding of pathogenesis and TMP-related therapy of SCI and associated neurodegenerative diseases.","zinc"

We hypothesized that delivery of AdV-ZFP-VEGF--an adenovirally delivered bio-engineered zinc-finger transcription factor that promotes endogenous VEGF-A expression--would result in angiogenesis, neuroprotection and functional recovery following SCI. This novel VEGF gene therapy induces the endogenous production of multiple VEGF-A isoforms; a critical factor for proper vascular development and repair. Briefly, female Wistar rats--under cyclosporin immunosuppression--received a 35 g clip-compression injury and were administered AdV-ZFP-VEGF or AdV-eGFP at 24 hours post-SCI. qRT-PCR and Western Blot analysis of VEGF-A mRNA and protein, showed significant increases in VEGF-A expression in AdV-ZFP-VEGF treated animals (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). Analysis of NF200, TUNEL, and RECA-1 indicated that AdV-ZFP-VEGF increased axonal preservation (p<0.05), reduced cell death (p<0.01), and increased blood vessels (p<0.01), respectively. Moreover, AdV-ZFP-VEGF resulted in a 10% increase in blood vessel proliferation (p<0.001).

Although the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood, previous studies from our laboratory indicate that inhibiting activation of the nuclear factor-κB transcription factor in astrocytes reduces white matter damage and improves functional recovery following spinal cord injury. In the current study, we demonstrate that activation of the nuclear factor-κB transcription factor within astrocytes results in a significant increase in oligodendrocyte death following trauma by reducing extracellular zinc levels and inducing glutamate excitotoxicity. By using an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (CNQX), we show that astroglial nuclear factor-κB-mediated oligodendrocyte death is dependent on glutamate signaling despite no change in extracellular glutamate concentrations. Further analysis demonstrated a reduction in levels of extracellular zinc in astrocyte cultures with functional nuclear factor-κB signaling following trauma. Cotreatment of oligodendrocytes with glutamate and zinc showed a significant increase in oligodendrocyte toxicity under low-zinc conditions, suggesting that the presence of zinc at specific concentrations can prevent glutamate excitotoxicity. These studies demonstrate a novel role for zinc in regulating oligodendrocyte excitotoxicity and identify new therapeutic targets to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death in central nervous system trauma and disease.","zinc"

Here, we examined the effect of ethanol extract of Bupleurum falcatum (BF) on functional recovery by inhibiting MMP-2 and -9 activation and inflammation after SCI. Rats received a moderate, weight-drop contusion injury to spinal cord were administered orally with BF at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 14 d and functional recovery was measured by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor open field behavioral rating test, inclined plane test and foot print analysis. To examine the neuroprotective effect of BF, TUNEL staining and counting were also performed.

Our data showed that BF significantly inhibited the expression and activation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 after SCI. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS were also significantly attenuated by BF. Furthermore, BF reduced apoptotic cell death at 1 d after injury, thereby significantly reduced lesion volume and improved functional recovery.

Zinc plays an important role in regulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in nervous system, which can improve the pathological state of neurons and promote regeneration of injured neurons, reduce neuronal apoptosis. Our previous studies demonstrated that the serum zinc levels in SCI model group were significantly decreased and zinc concentrations in spinal cord were gradually increased in 24 h after SCI, which induces the up-regulation of zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1). The mRNA levels of ZnT1 and BDNF were both increased after SCI, and there is a positive correlation between them. Excess zinc exposure has been proved to be a risk factor for neuron death in brain and spinal cord injuries, but supplement of the right amount of zinc may be useful in promoting the recovery of spinal cord function.","zinc"

Enhancing angiogenesis through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression therefore constitutes an attractive therapeutic approach. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that VEGF-A may also exhibit neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and neuroproliferative effects. Building on this previous work, we seek to examine the potential therapeutic benefits of an engineered zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcription factor designed to activate expression of all isoforms of endogenous VEGF-A (ZFP-VEGF). Administration of ZFP-VEGF resulted in increased VEGF-A mRNA and protein levels, an attenuation of axonal degradation, a significant increase in vascularity and decreased levels of apoptosis. Furthermore, ZFP-VEGF treated animals showed significant improvements in tissue preservation and neurobehavioural outcomes. These data suggest that activation of VEGF-A via the administration of an engineered ZFP transcription factor holds promise as a therapy for SCI and potentially other forms of neurotrauma.","zinc"

Functional recovery from such intervention has been routinely evaluated by a simple motor examination or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) after short-term drug administration. We comprehensively evaluated the influence of continuously administered indomethacin and nifedipine on functional outcome after impact spinal cord injury. SSEP and cortico-motor evoked potential records and neurologic examinations were obtained over 6 weeks after injury. Terminal histopathologic changes within the spinal cord were also examined. Only indomethacin significantly improved neurological function and reduced the severity of histopathologic change. Evoked potential analysis was not found to be of prognostic value. Modulation of prostaglandin pathways may enhance neurological recovery after spinal cord injury."

Primary neurons were isolated and cultured. Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups and fed diets with different amounts of n‑3 PUFAs. A model of spinal cord contusion was created at the T10 spinal segment and the composition of PUFAs was analyzed using gas chromatography. Spinal repair and motor function were evaluated postoperatively. Assessment of the effects of n‑3 PUFAs on autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was performed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In vitro, n‑3 PUFAs inhibited mTORC1 and enhanced autophagy. The n‑3 PUFA levels and the ratio of n‑3 PUFA to n‑6 PUFA in the spinal cord and serum of rats fed a high‑n‑3 PUFA diet were higher before and after operation (P<0.05). Additionally, rats in the high‑n‑3 PUFA group showed improved motor function recovery, spinal cord repair‑related protein expression level (MBP, Galc and GFAP). Expression levels if these protiens in the high‑n‑3 PUFA diet group expressed the highest levels, followed by the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group and finally the control group (P<0.05). high‑n‑3 PUFA diet promoted autophagy ability and inhibited activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared with the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group or the control group (P<0.05). These results suggest that exogenous dietary n‑3 PUFAs can inhibit mTORC1 signaling and enhance autophagy, promoting functional recovery of rats with SCI."

Two reviewers independently classified articles from January 1970 through October 2015, and 18 articles were selected. Due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. However, high-quality evidence showed that cranberry supplementation is not effective for prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in SCI. Moderate-quality evidence supported a beneficial effect of vitamin D, alpha-lipoic acid, and omega-3 supplementation, although replication of results is needed. There were conflicting results for the effect of creatine supplementation on improvement of motor outcomes. Low-quality evidence does not permit assessment of the effectiveness of melatonin, whey protein, vitamin C, and Chinese herb in SCI. There is sufficient data suggesting that cranberry supplementation is ineffective for prevention of UTIs in individuals with SCI. There is insufficient data to support or refute the use of any other dietary supplement in individuals with SCI."

However, the precise molecular mechanism coupling n-3 PUFAs to neurorestorative responses is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) after contusive SCI and to investigate whether this protein plays a role in n-3 PUFA-mediated functional recovery post-SCI. We found that SCI resulted in a robust spinal cord up-regulation in FABP5 mRNA levels (556 ± 187%) and protein expression (518 ± 195%), when compared to sham-operated rats, at 7 days post-injury (dpi). This upregulation coincided with significant alterations in the metabolism of fatty acids in the injured spinal cord, as revealed by metabolomics-based lipid analyses. In particular, we found increased levels of the n-3 series PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) at 7 dpi. Animals consuming a diet rich in DHA and EPA exhibited a significant upregulation in FABP5 mRNA levels at 7 dpi. Immunofluorescence showed low basal FABP5 immunoreactivity in spinal cord ventral gray matter NeuN(+) neurons of sham-operated rats. SCI resulted in a robust induction of FABP5 in glial (GFAP(+), APC(+), and NG2(+)) and precursor cells (DCX(+), nestin(+)). We found that continuous intrathecal administration of FABP5 silencing with small interfering RNA (2 μg) impaired spontaneous open-field locomotion post-SCI. Further, FABP5 siRNA administration hindered the beneficial effects of DHA to ameliorate functional recovery at 7 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggest that FABP5 may be an important player in the promotion of cellular uptake, transport, and/or metabolism of DHA post-SCI. Given the beneficial roles of n-3 PUFAs in ameliorating functional recovery, we propose that FABP5 is an important contributor to basic repair mechanisms in the injured spinal cord."

Acute DHA administration is neuroprotective and promotes functional recovery in animal models of adult spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the mechanisms underlying this recovery have not been fully characterized. Here we investigated the effects of an acute intravenous bolus of DHA delivered after SCI and characterized DHA-induced neuroplasticity within the adult injured spinal cord. We found robust sprouting of uninjured corticospinal and serotonergic fibers in a rat cervical hemisection SCI model. A mouse pyramidotomy model was used to confirm that this robust sprouting was not species or injury model specific. Furthermore, we demonstrated that corticospinal fibers sprouting to the denervated side of the cord following pyramidotomy contact V2a interneurons. We also demonstrated increased serotonin fibers and synaptophysin in direct contact with motor neurons. DHA also increased synaptophysin in rat cortical cell cultures. A reduction in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been shown to be involved in axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity. We showed that DHA significantly upregulates miR-21 and downregulates PTEN in corticospinal neurons. Downregulation of PTEN and upregulation of phosphorylated AKT by DHA were also seen in primary cortical neuron cultures and were accompanied by increased neurite outgrowth. In summary, acute DHA induces anatomical and synaptic plasticity in adult injured spinal cord. This study shows that DHA has therapeutic potential in cervical SCI and provides evidence that DHA could exert its beneficial effects in SCI via enhancement of neuroplasticity. In this study, we show that an acute intravenous injection of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 30 min after spinal cord injury induces neuroplasticity. We found robust sprouting of uninjured corticospinal and serotonergic fibers in a rat hemisection spinal cord injury model. A mouse pyramidotomy model was used to confirm that the robust sprouting involved V2a interneurons. We show that DHA significantly upregulates miR-21 and phosphorylated AKT, and downregulates phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is involved in suppressing anatomical plasticity, in corticospinal neurons and in primary cortical neuron cultures. We conclude that acute DHA can induce anatomical and synaptic plasticity.

The long chain ω-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have significant biological effects. In particular, DHA is a major component of cell membranes in the brain. It is also involved in neurotransmission. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly devastating pathology that can lead to catastrophic dysfunction, with a significant reduction in the quality of life. Previous studies have shown that EPA and DHA can exert neuroprotective effects in SCI in mice and rats. The aim of this study was to analyze the mechanism of action of ω-3 PUFAs, such as DHA, in a mouse model of SCI, with a focus on the early pathophysiological processes. In this study, SCI was induced in mice by the application of an aneurysm clip onto the dura mater via a four-level T5 to T8 laminectomy. Thirty minutes after compression, animals received a tail vein injection of DHA at a dose of 250 nmol/kg. All animals were killed at 24 h after SCI, to evaluate various parameters implicated in the spread of the injury. Our results in this in-vivo study clearly demonstrate that DHA treatment reduces key factors associated with spinal cord trauma. Treatment with DHA significantly reduced: (1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, (2) pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α), (3) nitrotyrosine formation, (4) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and (5) apoptosis (Fas-L, Bax, and Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, DHA significantly improved the recovery of limb function.Furthermore, in this study we evaluated the effect of oxidative stress on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells using a well-characterized in-vitro model. Treatment with DHA ameliorated the effects of oxidative stress on neurite length and branching. Our results, in vivo and in vitro, clearly demonstrate that DHA treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma."

Preventive administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or the consumption of a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PUFAs) confers potent prophylaxis against SCI and improves functional recovery. The present study examines whether this novel dietary strategy provides significant antinociceptive benefits in rats experiencing SCI-induced pain. Rats were fed control chow or chow enriched with O3PUFAs for 8weeks before being subjected to sham or cord contusion surgeries, continuing the same diets after surgery for another 8 more weeks. The paw sensitivity to noxious heat was quantified for at least 8weeks post-SCI using the Hargreaves test. We found that SCI rats consuming the preventive O3PUFA-enriched diet exhibited a significant reduction in thermal hyperalgesia compared to those consuming the normal diet. Functional neurometabolomic profiling revealed a distinctive deregulation in the metabolism of endocannabinoids (eCB) and related N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) at 8weeks post-SCI. We found that O3PUFAs consumption led to a robust accumulation of novel NAE precursors, including the glycerophospho-containing docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (DPEA), and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The tissue levels of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the antihyperalgesic phenotype. In addition, rats consuming the O3PUFA-rich diet showed reduced sprouting of nociceptive fibers containing CGRP and dorsal horn neuron p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, well-established biomarkers of pain. The spinal cord levels of inositols were positively correlated with thermal hyperalgesia, supporting their role as biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain. Notably, the O3PUFA-rich dietary intervention reduced the levels of these metabolites. Collectively, these results demonstrate the prophylactic value of dietary O3PUFA against SCI-mediated chronic pain."

In addition to the initial neuronal and glial cell loss, secondary injuries such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation magnify the initial damage. Current strategies involve surgical stabilization and decompression and post-injury rehabilitation but these result in only limited improvements. Therefore, there is still a need for pharmacological interventions to limit the secondary injury processes and improve functional recovery. Research in the past decade has implicated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as a neuroprotective agent capable of limiting post-injury excitotoxic events. This commentary examines the recent findings suggesting a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role for the PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in a mouse model of SCI.

Rats were fed with either control chow or chow enriched with ω-3 PUFAs (750 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks before being subjected to a sham or a contusion SCI operation. We report new evidence showing that rats subjected to SCI after being pre-treated with a diet enriched with ω-3 PUFAs exhibit significantly better functional outcomes. Pre-treated animals exhibited lower sensory deficits, autonomic bladder recovery, and early improvements in locomotion that persisted for at least 8 weeks after trauma. We found that SCI triggers a robust alteration in the cord PUFA neurolipidome, which was characterized by a marked docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency. This DHA deficiency was associated with dysfunction and corrected with the ω-3 PUFA-enriched diet. Multivariate data analyses revealed that the spinal cord of animals consuming the ω-3 PUFA-enriched diet had a fundamentally distinct neurolipidome, particularly increasing the levels of essential and long chain ω-3 fatty acids and lysolipids at the expense of ω-6 fatty acids and its metabolites. Altogether, dietary ω-3 PUFAs prophylaxis confers resiliency to SCI mediated, at least in part, by generating a neuroprotective and restorative neurolipidome."

In this study we used transgenic fat-1 mice to examine whether enriching spinal cord tissue in endogenous omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has an effect on the outcome after compression spinal cord injury. The results demonstrate that after thoracic compression spinal cord injury, fat-1 mice display better locomotor recovery compared with the wild-type mice on a high omega-6 diet (high omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in tissues), and wild-type mice on a normal diet (controls). This is associated with a significant increase in neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival and a decrease in non-phosphorylated neurofilament loss. The protection from spinal cord injury in fat-1 mice was also correlated with a reduction in microglia/macrophage activation and in pro-inflammatory mediators. In vitro experiments in dorsal root ganglia primary sensory neurons further demonstrated that a fat-1 tissue background confers robust neuroprotection against a combined mechanical stretch and hypoxic injury. In conclusion, our studies support the hypothesis that a raised omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid level and an altered tissue omega-6/omega-3 ratio prior to injury leads to a much improved outcome after spinal cord injury."

Fenretinide also reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes and the levels of oxidative stress markers after SCI. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated that fenretinide reduced TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) expression by reactive microglia. These results demonstrate that fenretinide treatment after SCI can reduce inflammation and tissue damage in the spinal cord and improve locomotor recovery. These beneficial effects may be mediated via the ability of fenretinide to modulate PUFA homeostasis. Since fenretinide is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers, this drug might be a good candidate for the treatment of acute SCI in humans."

Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is an event with devastating consequences, and no satisfactory treatment is available at present. The pathogenetic mechanisms associated with SCI include excitotoxicity, increased oxidation and inflammation. We review here our recent studies, which suggest that omega-3 PUFA have significant neuroprotective potential in spinal cord trauma. In a first study, we administered an intravenous bolus of alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 30 min after spinal cord hemisection injury in adult rats. The omega-3 PUFA led to increased neuronal and glial survival, and a significantly improved neurological outcome. In subsequent studies, we tested DHA in a more severe compression model of SCI. We also explored a combined acute and chronic treatment regime using DHA. Saline or DHA was administered intravenously 30 min after compression of the spinal cord. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet for 6 weeks following injury. We assessed locomotor recovery and analysed markers for cell survival and axonal damage, and we also investigated the effects of the treatment on the inflammatory reaction and the oxidative stress that follow SCI. We showed that the acute DHA treatment is neuroprotective after compression SCI, even if the treatment is delayed up to an hour after injury. The DHA injection led to an increased neuronal and glial cell survival, and the effect of the DHA injection was amplified by addition of DHA to the diet. Rats treated with a DHA injection and a DHA-enriched diet performed significantly better at 6 weeks in terms of neurological outcome. The analysis of the tissue after DHA administration showed that the fatty acid significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and RNA/DNA oxidation, and the induction of COX-2. Parallel studies in a facial nerve injury model in mice also showed pro-regenerative effects of chronic dietary administration of DHA after nerve lesion. These observations suggest that treatment with omega-3 PUFA could represent a promising therapeutic approach in the management of neurological injury."

However, the mechanism of action underlying these effects has not been elucidated, and the optimum treatment regime remains to be defined. We have therefore carried out a detailed analysis of the effects of DHA in adult rats subject to thoracic compression SCI. Saline or DHA (250 nmol/kg) was administered intravenously (i.v.) 30 min after compression. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet for 1 or 6 weeks, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet (400 mg/kg/day) for 1 or 6 weeks. Other groups received a DHA-enriched diet only for 1 week following injury, or received acute DHA (250 nmol/kg; i.v.) treatment delayed up to 3 h after injury. We also assessed oxidative stress and the inflammatory reaction at the injury site, neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival and axonal damage and the locomotor recovery. At 24 h, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, RNA/DNA oxidation and the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 were all significantly reduced by i.v. DHA administration. At 1 week and 6 weeks, macrophage recruitment was reduced and neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival was substantially increased. Axonal injury was reduced at 6 weeks. Locomotor recovery was improved from day 4, and sustained up to 6 weeks. Rats treated with a DHA-enriched diet in addition to the acute DHA injection were not significantly different from the acute DHA-treated animals at 1 week, but at 6 weeks showed additional improvements in both functional and histological outcomes. DHA treatment was ineffective if the acute injection was delayed until 3 h post-injury, or if the DHA was administered for 1 week solely by diet. Our results in a clinically relevant model of SCI show that significant neuroprotection can be obtained by combining an initial acute i.v. injection of DHA with a sustained dietary supplementation. Given that the safety and tolerability of preparations enriched in omega-3 fatty acids is already well-documented, such a combined DHA treatment regime deserves consideration as a very promising approach to SCI management."

Evidence suggests that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could target some of the pathological mechanisms that underlie damage after SCI. We examined the effects of treatment with PUFAs after lateral spinal cord hemisection in the rat. The omega-3 PUFAs alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) injected 30 min after injury induced significantly improved locomotor performance and neuroprotection, including decreased lesion size and apoptosis and increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival. Evidence showing a decrease in RNA/DNA oxidation suggests that the neuroprotective effect of omega-3 PUFAs involved a significant antioxidant function. In contrast, animals treated with arachidonic acid, an omega-6 PUFA, had a significantly worse outcome than controls. We confirmed the neuroprotective effect of omega-3 PUFAs by examining the effects of DHA treatment after spinal cord compression injury. Results indicated that DHA administered 30 min after spinal cord compression not only greatly increased survival of neurons but also resulted in significantly better locomotor performance for up to 6 weeks after injury. This report shows a striking difference in efficacy between the effects of treatment with omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs on the outcome of SCI, with omega-3 PUFAs being neuroprotective and omega-6 PUFAs having a damaging effect. Given the proven clinical safety of omega-3 PUFAs, our observations show that these PUFAs have significant therapeutic potential in SCI. In contrast, the use of preparations enriched in omega-6 PUFAs after injury could worsen outcome after SCI."

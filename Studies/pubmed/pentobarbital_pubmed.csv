This is the first study to show how two commonly used anesthetics affect continuously recorded hemodynamic parameters and locomotor recovery during a 2-week period after two levels of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We hypothesized that the level of cardiovascular depression and recovery of locomotor function would be dependent upon the anesthetic used during SCI. Thirty-two adult female rats were subjected to a sham, 25-mm or 50-mm SCI at T3-4 under pentobarbital or isoflurane anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were telemetrically recorded before, during, and after SCI. Locomotor function recovered best in the 25-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. There was no significant difference in locomotor recovery between the 25-mm-injured pentobarbital-anesthetized animals and the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. White matter sparing and extent of intermediolateral cell column loss appeared larger in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, but this was not significant. There were no differential effects of anesthetics on HR and MAP before SCI, but recovery from anesthesia was significantly slower in pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. At the time of SCI, MAP was acutely elevated in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, whereas MAP decreased in the isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Hypotension occurred in the pentobarbital-anesthetized groups and in the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized group. In pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, SCI resulted in acute elevation of HR, although HR remained low. Return of HR to baseline was much slower in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. Severe SCI at T3 produced significant chronic tachycardia that was injury severity dependent. Although some laboratories monitor blood pressure, HR, and other physiological variables during surgery for SCI, inherently few have monitored cardiovascular function during recovery. This study shows that anesthetics affect hemodynamic parameters differently, which in turn can affect functional outcome measures. This supports the need for a careful evaluation of cardiovascular and other physiological measures in experimental models of SCI. Choice of anesthetic should be an important consideration in experimental designs and data analyses."

The spinal cord injury was cooled with a custom cooling well used over the epidural surface. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) motor scores and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potential (tcMMEP) responses were used after injury to accurately evaluate neurologic recovery. This study was undertaken to determine whether the prognosis for neurologic recovery in a standardized rat spinal cord injury model is altered by the direct application of precisely controlled hypothermia to the area of injury. The role of hypothermia in the treatment of spinal cord injuries with neurologic deficits remains undefined. Hypothermia may decrease an area of spinal cord injury and limit secondary damage, therefore improving neurologic recovery. However, it has been difficult to consistently apply localized cooling to an area of spinal cord injury, and the use of systemic hypothermia is fraught with complications. This fact, along with the unavailability of a precise spinal cord injury model, has resulted in inconsistent results, both clinically and in the laboratory. In a rat model of spinal cord injury, 37 C and 19 C temperatures were used to study the role of hypothermia on neurologic recovery. Male Spraque-Dawley rats (n = 52; weight, 277.7 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to laminectomy at T10. The rats were divided into three groups: 1) placement of a 50% spacer in the epidural space (16 rats), 2) severe (25 g/cm) spinal cord injury (16 rats), 3) 50% spacer in combination with spinal cord injury (16 rats). Eight rats in each group were tested at two temperatures: normothermic (37 C) and hypothermic (19 C). With the use of a specially designed hypothermic pool placed directly over the spinal cord for 2 hours, epidural heating to 37 C, and epidural cooling to 19 C was accomplished. Simultaneous measurements of spinal cord and body temperatures were performed. The rats underwent behavior testing using the BBB motor scores and serial tcMMEPs for 5 weeks. Statistical methods consisted of Student's t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey post hoc t tests and chi2 tests. There was a significant improvement in motor scores in rats subjected to hypothermia compared with those that were normothermic after insertion of a 50% spacer. This improvement was observed during the 5-week duration of follow-up. In the severe spinal cord injury group and the spinal cord injury-spacer groups, no significant improvement in motor scores were obtained when the spinal cord was exposed to hypothermia. The results demonstrate that there is a statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvement in neurologic function in rats subjected to hypothermia (19 C) after insertion of a spacer that induced an ischemic spinal cord injury. This indicates that directly applied hypothermia may be beneficial in preventing injury secondary to ischemic cellular damage. The data demonstrated minimal therapeutic benefit of hypothermia (19 C) after a severe spinal cord injury."

Spinal cord injury was produced at T-10 by the weight-drop method and confirmed by the disappearance of the somatosensory-evoked response during the subsequent 15 minutes. In all experiments, drug or vehicle treatments were randomly administered as a single intravenous bolus 15 minutes after injury. Functional outcome was blindly assessed for 2 weeks after injury using a modified Tarlov scale, and in some cases, the Rivlin-Tator angleboard test. The survival of descending raphe-spinal axons was determined by the measurement of serotonin in postmortem spinal tissues located above and below the site of injury. In separate acute experiments, the physiological and hemodynamic correlates of a 50 gm cm injury and either mianserin or vehicle injection were examined, as were the effects on serotonin content and metabolism in spinal tissues harvested 30 minutes after injury. All doses of mianserin were associated with some index of improved recovery following a 50 gm cm injury, with a 1-mg/kg dose being clearly superior. Both ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (2 mg/kg) displayed marginal therapeutic actions for 50 gm cm injuries. In acute studies, mianserin at 1 mg/kg was associated with the preservation of posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow at T-12 as well as a pronounced alteration in postmortem spinal serotonin content and metabolism, in contrast to vehicle control treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Neurologic function was assessed in a blinded fashion for one week after injury using a modification of the method of Tarlov. The post-mortem concentrations of serotonin and its metabolite were measured in injured and surrounding spinal tissues in a subset of animals in order to estimate the survival of descending long-tract axons. In initial studies using non-ventilated animals where body temperature was not controlled (n = 130), halothane anesthesia was associated with significantly better neurologic scores at all levels of injury (50, 100 and 250 g.cm) in comparison to pentobarbital. In a second experiment under these conditions (n = 53) the effect of halothane was observed after a 50 g.cm injury in comparison to both pentobarbital and nitrous oxide. Improved neurologic recovery was accompanied by the preservation of normal serotonin and metabolite concentrations in spinal tissue caudal to the site of injury. These values did not differ from those measured in sham-operated animals. Separate experiments (n = 12) revealed halothane's preservation of somatosensory-evoked responses during the early postinjury period in animals showing improved neurologic recovery. Subsequent experiments (n = 12) were performed to assess the effect of oxygen supplementation and the control of rectal temperature and a separate series of acute experiments (n = 14) examined arterial blood pressure responses to injury in halothane- and pentobarbital-anesthetized animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It is longer acting than TRH and has substantially greater potency with regard to central facilitatory activity. In the present studies, the effect of YM-14673 was examined in rats following standardized traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. Pentobarbital-anesthetized animals were subjected to fluid-percussion-induced brain trauma to the parietal cortex or impact trauma to the thoracic spinal cord. After injury animals were randomly assigned to treatment with i.v. YM-14673 at varying doses--0.1 mg/kg (low), 1.0 mg/kg (moderate), or 10 mg/kg (high)--or equal volume physiological saline. Treatment with YM-14673 improved chronic neurological recovery after trauma in both injury models; optimal beneficial effects were found at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. These findings confirm previous observations that TRH or TRH analogs may improve outcome after traumatic brain and spinal cord injury and are consistent with the hypothesis that TRH analogs preserving the C-terminus are effective in CNS trauma."

First, in a blinded protocol, male CF-1 mice were treated intravenously with either saline or U-50488H (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg) within 3-5 min following a reproducible and quantifiable moderately severe (900 g/cm) concussive head injury. Using a grip test at 1 h postinjury to evaluate the neurological status of the injured mice, U-50488H produced a dose-related improvement in early recovery compared to the saline-treated mice. The effect was significant (P less than 0.05) after the 3 or 10 mg/kg i.v. doses. A similar concussive injury markedly reduced the % of cardiac output perfusing the forebrain (cerebral blood flow). U-50488H (10 and 20 mg/kg) partially reversed this effect to a significant degree 60 min after a 20 mg/kg dose. Secondly, the effects of U-50488H on the development of progressive post-traumatic spinal cord white matter ischemia after a 500 g/cm contusive injury were studied in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. In 4 untreated cats, there was a progressive fall in spinal cord and blood flow (SCBF) from a 10-min postinjury level of 10.5 +/- 0.7 ml/100 g/min to 6.1 +/- 0.3 (P less than 0.03 by paired t at 4 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Control animals subjected to injuries of a magnitude of 400 or 500 gm-cm occasionally demonstrated spontaneous return of translesion SCEP within 2 hours of injury when maintained by pentobarbital anesthesia and by ventilation with ambient room air at 1 atmosphere absolute pressure (1 ATA). Animals sustaining corresponding injuries but receiving immediate treatment with HBO at 2 ATA for a period of 3 hours following impact demonstrated variable responses to this treatment modality. Animals sustaining injuries of 400 gm-cm magnitude showed recovery of translesion SCEP in four of five cases, while animals sustaining injuries of 500 gm-cm magnitude responded to HBO treatment by recovery of SCEP no more frequently than did control animals. When the onset of HBO therapy was delayed by 2 hours following impact, there appeared to be no demonstrable protective effect on long-tract neuronal conduction mediated by HBO alone. The observations suggest that HBO treatments can mediate preservation of marginally injured neuronal elements of the spinal cord long tracts during the early phases of traumatic spinal cord injury. These protective effects may be based upon the reversal of focal tissue hypoxia, or by reduction of tissue edema. HBO treatment markedly diminished the protective effects of HBO on long-tract neuronal conduction following traumatic spinal cord injury."

Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and injured by placing a 190-gm weight on the spinal cord for 5 minutes. Biochemical analysis of the injured segment revealed a significant depletion in the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (P-creatine), and total adenylates for the entire 24-hour recovery period. Glucose levels initially declined, but by 1 hour had normalized, and at 8 and 24 hours were significantly supranormal. The lactate/pyruvate ratio and tissue lactate concentrations increased four and five and half times, respectively, for the first 4 hours after injury. Between 8 and 24 hours, lactate levels remained elevated, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio declined to contol levels as the result of a significant rise in the tissue pyruvate concentration. This sequence of metabolic changes suggested that metabolism was probably not homogeneous throughout the injured segment, and that tissue metabolic rate was depressed for the initial 4 hours after trauma then increased in metabolically active tissue for the remainder of the 24-hour recovery period. This model of spinal cord trauma results in a severe, prolonged ischemia and metabolic injury to the affected tissue. Whether these metabolic changes results from or cause the tissue damage and irreversible paraplegia associated with this type of spinal cord injury remains to be determined."

Improving neurological recovery by reducing secondary injury is a major principle in the management of SCI. To minimize secondary injury, blood pressure (BP) augmentation has been advocated. The objective of this study was to review the evidence behind BP management after SCI. METHODS This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Using the PubMed database, the authors identified studies that investigated BP management after acute SCI. Information on BP goals, duration of BP management, vasopressor selection, and neurological outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Eleven studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. Nine studies were retrospective, and 2 were single-cohort prospective investigations. Of the 9 retrospective studies, 7 reported a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of higher than 85 mm Hg. For the 2 prospective studies, the MAP goals were higher than 85 mm Hg and higher than 90 mm Hg. The duration of BP management varied from more than 24 hours to 7 days in 6 of the retrospective studies that reported the duration of treatment. In both prospective studies, the duration of treatment was 7 days. In the 2 prospective studies, neurological outcomes were stable to improved with BP management. The retrospective studies, however, were contradictory with regard to the correlation of BP management and outcomes. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were the agents that were frequently used to augment BP. However, more complications have been associated with dopamine use than with the other vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS There are no high-quality data regarding optimal BP goals and duration in the management of acute SCI. Based on the highest level of evidence available from the 2 prospective studies, MAP goals of 85-90 mm Hg for a duration of 5-7 days should be considered. Norepinephrine for cervical and upper thoracic injuries and phenylephrine or norepinephrine for mid- to lower thoracic injuries should be considered."

Penetrating SCI is associated with poor prognosis, but there is a paucity of literature examining the role of vasopressor administration for the maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals in this patient population. To elucidate this topic and to determine the efficacy of vasopressor administration in penetrating SCI by examining a case series of consecutive penetrating SCIs. We reviewed consecutive patients with complete penetrating SCI who met inclusion and exclusion criteria, including the administration of vasopressors to maintain MAP goals. We identified 14 patients with complete penetrating SCIs with an admission American Spinal Injury Association grade of A from 2005 to 2011. The neurological recovery, complications, interventions, and vasopressor administration strategies were reviewed and compared with those of a cohort with complete blunt SCI. In our patient population, only 1 patient with penetrating SCI (7.1%) experienced neurological recovery, as determined by improvement in the American Spinal Injury Association grade, despite the administration of vasopressors for supraphysiological MAP goals for an average of 101.07 ± 34.96 hours. Furthermore, 71.43% of patients with penetrating SCI treated with vasopressors experienced associated cardiogenic complications. Given the decreased likelihood of neurological improvement in penetrating injuries, it may be important to re-examine intervention strategies in this population. Specifically, the use of vasopressors, in particular dopamine, with their associated complications is more likely to cause complications than to result in neurological improvement. Our experience shows that patients with acute penetrating SCI are unlikely to recover, despite aggressive cardiopulmonary management.

Our aim was to describe vasopressor usage and examine their effects in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 131 patients with SCI who received any kind of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure in the neurocritical care unit of a Level 1 trauma center (2005-2011). Vasopressor usage and complications were obtained from the medical record. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the American Spinal Injury Association score. Dopamine was the most commonly used vasopressor (48.0%), followed by phenylephrine (45.0%), norepinephrine (5.0%), epinephrine (1.5%), and vasopressin (0.5%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complications (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, troponin elevation, atrial fibrillation, heart rate >130 or <50, etc.) due to vasopressors were independently associated with the overall usages of dopamine (odds ratio [OR] 8.97; p<0.001) and phenylephrine (OR, 5.92; p=0.004), age ≥60 years old (OR, 5.16; p=0.013), and complete SCI (OR, 3.23; p=0.028). There was no difference in neurological improvement with either dopamine (OR, 1.16; p=0.788) or phenylephrine (OR 0.96; p=0.940). Incomplete SCI (OR, 2.64; p=0.019) and surgery <24 h after SCI (OR, 4.25; p=0.025) were independently associated with improved outcome. In summary, vasopressors are associated with increased complications in SCI patients. Further prospective studies are required in order to determine the potential benefits and risks of blood pressure management in patients with SCI."

Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined."

We do not know how such blood pressure lability affects the vasculature. We used a well-characterized animal model of AD to determine whether increasing the frequency of AD during recovery from SCI would exacerbate injury-induced dysfunction in resistance vessels. Experimental animal study. International Collaboration On Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, Canada. Complete transection of the T3 spinal cord was performed in male Wistar rats. For 14 days after injury, AD was induced via colorectal distension (CRD; 30 minutes per day) in the experimental group (SCI-CRD). One month after SCI, baseline cardiovascular parameters and severity of CRD-induced AD were assessed in SCI-CRD animals and SCI-only controls. Mesenteric arteries were harvested for in vitro myography to characterize vasoactive responses to phenylephrine (PE) and acetylcholine (ACh). Mesenteric arteries from SCI-CRD animals exhibited larger maximal responses to PE than arteries from SCI-only controls. Hyperresponsiveness to PE was not a product of endothelial dysfunction because mesenteric arteries from both groups had similar vasodilator responses to ACh. Both SCI-only controls and SCI-CRD animals exhibited CRD-evoked AD 1 month after SCI; however, CRD-induced hypertension was less pronounced in animals that were previously exposed to CRD. Injury-induced changes within the vasculature may contribute to the development of AD after SCI. Here, we provide evidence that AD itself has significant and long-lasting effects on vascular function. This finding has implications for the medical management of AD and provides an impetus for maintaining stable blood pressure."

However, there remain concerns that excessively high blood pressure during spinal cord reperfusion may aggravate the reperfusion injury. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of high blood pressure during spinal cord reperfusion on postoperative neurologic outcomes after aortic surgery in rabbits. Experiments were performed using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion model in 2 randomly divided groups: (1) In the HR group, the mean blood pressure was maintained at a high level (121 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) during reperfusion with intravenously administered phenylephrine; and (2) in the CR group, the mean blood pressure was not medically controlled (75 +/- 9.1 mm Hg) during reperfusion. Neurologic and histologic assessments and evaluation of early reperfusion injury were performed. In the HR group, slow and incomplete recovery of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (P = .02) and low neurologic scores (P < .005) were observed during spinal cord reperfusion compared with the CR group. At 48 hours of reperfusion, there were significantly fewer viable neuron cells, more apoptosis, and more perivascular edema with gray matter vacuolation in the HR group (P < .001 for each). At 3 hours, myeloperoxidase activity (P = .0021), vascular permeability (P = .0012), and superoxide generation (P < .0001) were significantly increased in the HR group. Excessively high blood pressure in the early phase of spinal cord reperfusion increased reperfusion injury in the spinal cord, leading to exacerbation of early-onset paraplegia. Avoidance of spinal cord reperfusion with high blood pressure may be one management strategy in thoracoabdominal aortic surgery."

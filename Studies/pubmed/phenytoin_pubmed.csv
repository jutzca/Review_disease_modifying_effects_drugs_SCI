There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects. The aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury. This was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30 days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort. Of the cohort (n = 570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p = 0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p = 0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p = 0.82 in propensity-matched cohort). Non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes."

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Influx of Na(+) ions into cells has been postulated to be a key early event in the pathogenesis of secondary traumatic and ischemic central nervous system injury. Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole--after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), phenytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p<0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na(+) blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin."

Abnormal sodium influx has been implicated as one of the key events in the pathophysiology of the SCI. Pharmacological blockade of sodium channels can reduce secondary injury and increase recovery from trauma. The aim of the present study was to show the neuroprotective effect of phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker, after experimental SCI. Control and laminectomy-only groups were not injured. 50 g-cm weight drop injury was produced in the trauma group. In the treatment groups, methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) and phenytoin (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally immediately after injury. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the spinal cord samples were examined for lipid peroxidation. Spinal cord ultrastructure was evaluated and grading system was used for quantitative evaluation. Trauma increased tissue MDA levels. Treatment with methylprednisolone and phenytoin decreased MDA levels compared to trauma in all doses. Significant ultrastructural neuroprotection was observed with 30 mg/kg of phenytoin treatment according to general neural score. This ultrastructural neuroprotection of phenytoin was not different from methylprednisolone. Phenytoin appears to protect spinal cord against injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation and lessening neuronal damage associated with SCI in rats."

In this study, we hypothesized that phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker, would result in protection of axons with concomitant improvement of functional recovery after SCI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 contusion SCI after being fed normal chow or chow containing phenytoin; serum levels of phenytoin were within therapeutic range at the time of injury. At various timepoints after injury, quantitative assessment of lesion volumes, axonal degeneration, axonal conduction, and functional locomotor recovery were performed. When compared to controls, phenytoin-treated animals demonstrated reductions in the degree of destruction of gray and white matter surrounding the lesion epicenter, sparing of axons within the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) and dorsal column (DC) system rostral to the lesion site, and within the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) caudal to the lesion site, and enhanced axonal conduction across the lesion site. Improved performance in measures of skilled locomotor function was observed in phenytoin-treated animals. Based on these results, we conclude that phenytoin provides neuroprotection and improves functional outcome after experimental SCI, and that it merits further examination as a potential treatment strategy in human SCI."

Pharmacological blockade of these channels can attenuate secondary pathophysiology and reduce functional deficits acutely. To determine the therapeutic effects of Na+ channel blockers on long-term tissue sparing and functional neurological recovery after traumatic SCI, the authors injected Wistar rats intraperitoneally with riluzole (5 mg/kg), phenytoin (30 mg/kg), CNS5546A, a novel Na+ channel blocker (15 mg/kg), or vehicle (2-HP3CD; 5 mg/kg) 15 minutes after induction of compressive SCI at C7-T1. Functional neurological recovery of coordinated hindlimb function and strength, assessed 1 week postinjury and weekly thereafter for 6 weeks, was significantly enhanced in animals treated with riluzole compared with the other treatment groups. Seven weeks postinjury the preservation of residual tissue and integrity of descending axons were determined with digital morphometrical and fluorescent histochemical analysis. All three Na+ channel blockers significantly enhanced residual tissue area at the injury epicenter compared with control. Riluzole significantly reduced tissue loss in rostrocaudal regions surrounding the epicenter, with overall sparing of gray matter and selective sparing of white matter. Also, counts of red nuclei neurons retrogradely labeled with fluorogold introduced caudal to the injury site were significantly increased in the riluzole group. Systemic Na+ channel blockers, in particular riluzole, can confer significant neuroprotection after in vivo SCI and result in behavioral recovery and sparing of both gray and white matter."

Comparison between PHT and dexamethasone reveals that PHT is at least as effective. The therapeutic effectiveness of PHT treatment begun immediately after injury and begun 30 minutes later was evaluated. The results obtained in all three treated groups of dogs were superior to the results with untreated controls at a significance level of P < 0.01."

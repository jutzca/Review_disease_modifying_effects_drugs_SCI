This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of miR-135a-5p in regulating the functional recovery of SCI by impacting its target genes and downstream signaling. The gene transfection assay and luciferase reporter assay confirmed the target relationship between miR-135a-5p and its target genes (specificity protein 1 [SP1] and Rho-associated kinase [ROCK]1/2). By establishing the H2O2-induced injury model, miR-135a-5p transfection was found to inhibit the apoptosis of PC12 cells by downregulating the SP1 gene, which subsequently induced downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3) and upregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. By measuring the neurite lengths of PC12 cells, miR-135a-5p transfection was found to promote axon outgrowth by downregulating the ROCK1/2 gene, which subsequently caused upregulation of phosphate protein kinase B (AKT) and phosphate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Use of the rat SCI models showed that miR-135a-5p could increase the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores, indicating neurological function recovery. In conclusion, the miR-135a-5p-SP1-Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 and miR-135a-5p-ROCK-AKT/GSK3β axes are involved in functional recovery of SCI by regulating neural apoptosis and axon regeneration, respectively, and thus can be promising effective therapeutic strategies in SCI."

This study is based on a paradigm shift in the therapeutic approach for treating spinal cord injury (SCI). The authors tested a new treatment targeting removal of CNS glutamate into the blood circulation by injection of the blood glutamate scavengers (BGSs) recombinant enzyme glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (rGOT1) and its cosubstrate oxaloacetic acid (OxAc). Their primary objective was to investigate whether BGS treatment, followed by treadmill exercises in mice with SCI, could attenuate excitotoxicity, inflammation, scarring, and axonal degeneration and, at a later time point, improve functional recovery. A pharmacokinetic experiment was done in C57BL/6 naive mice to verify rGOT1/OxAc blood activity and to characterize the time curve of glutamate reduction in the blood up to 24 hours. The reduction of glutamate in CSF after BGS administration in mice with SCI was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Next, SCI (left hemisection) was induced in the mice, and the mice were randomly assigned to one of the following groups at 1 hour postinjury: control (underwent SCI and received PBS), treadmill exercises, rGOT1/OxAc treatment, or rGOT1/OxAc treatment followed by treadmill exercises. Treatment started 1 hour postinjury with an injection of rGOT1/OxAc and continued for 5 consecutive days. Starting 1 week after SCI, the exercises and the combined treatment groups recommenced the treadmill exercise regimen 5 days a week for 3 months. Locomotor function was assessed for 3 months using the horizontal grid walking test and CatWalk. Axonal anterograde and wallerian degenerations were evaluated using tetramethylrhodamine dextran. Tissue sections were immunofluorescently stained for Iba1, GFAP, GAP-43, synaptophysin, and NeuN. BGS treatment decreased the CSF glutamate level up to 50%, reduced axonal wallerian degeneration, and increased axonal survival and GAP-43 expression in neuronal cells. Combined treatment reduced inflammation, scarring, and lesion size. Additionally, the combination of BGS treatment and exercises increased synapses around motor neurons and enhanced axonal regeneration through the lesion site. This resulted in motor function improvement 3 months post-SCI. As shown by biochemical, immunohistochemical, and functional analysis, BGSs exhibit a substantial neuroprotective effect by reducing excitotoxicity and secondary damage after SCI. Furthermore, in combination with exercises, they reduced axonal degeneration and scarring and resulted in improved functional recovery."

The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist, FTY720, plays an important protective role in neuronal injury. This study aims to examine the effects of FTY720 in a rat acute SCI model, focusing on neuropathic pain. Female rats with SCI induced by 1-min clip compression were administered vehicle or 1.5 mg/kg of FTY720 24 h after the injury. Using the mechanical nociceptive threshold test, we monitored neuropathic pain and performed histological analysis of the pain pathway, including the μ opioid receptor (MOR), hydroxytryptamine transporter (HTT), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Motor score, SCI lesion volume, residual motor axons, inflammatory response, glial scar, and microvascular endothelial dysfunction were also compared between the two groups. FTY720 treatment resulted in significant attenuation of post-traumatic neuropathic pain. It also decreased systemic and local inflammation, thereby reducing the damaged areas and astrogliosis and resulting in motor functional recovery. Whereas there was no difference in the CGRP expression between the two groups, FTY720 significantly preserved the MOR in both the caudal and rostral areas of the spinal dorsal horn. Whereas HTT was preserved in the FTY720 group, it was significantly increased in the rostral side and decreased in the caudal side of the injury in the vehicle group. These results suggest that FTY720 ameliorates post-traumatic allodynia through regulation of neuroinflammation, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and inhibition of glial scar formation, thereby preserving the connectivity of the descending inhibitory pathway and reducing neuropathic pain."

The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of dBcAMP on learning, memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in the excitotoxically lesioned hippocampus. An excitotoxic lesion was induced in the hippocampi of 4-month-old male BALB/c mice by injecting 0.25 μg/μl into the lateral ventricles of both sides. The lesioned mice (L) were divided into L+dBcAMP and L+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) groups. Sham surgery (S) was done by the injection of 1 μl of sterile saline into the lateral ventricles. The sham surgery mice were divided into S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups. Mice in the L+dBcAMP and S+dBcAMP groups were treated with dBcAMP for 1 week (i.p., 50 mg/kg), whereas mice in the L+PBS and S+PBS groups were treated with PBS. The mice in all groups were subjected to water maze and passive avoidance tests at the end of the 4th week. Cresyl violet staining and NeuN and doublecortin immunostaining were done to analyze the morphology and neurogenesis. The water maze learning sessions did not show a significant difference in escape latency between the groups, suggesting an unimpaired learning ability of mice in all groups. The L+dBcAMP mice had significantly short entry latency and higher target quadrant time/distance traveled compared to the L+PBS group, suggesting better memory retention. The L+dBcAMP group had a significantly improved memory retention compared to the L+PBS mice during the passive avoidance test. Morphological studies showed significantly greater adult neurons and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice in the L+dBcAMP group compared to those in the L+PBS group. There was no significant difference between the S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups in the water maze/passive avoidance tests and the number of neurons. In conclusion, dBcAMP protects the hippocampal neuron from degeneration and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, learning, and memory."

However, the inhospitable microenvironment in the injured spinal cord results in poor cell survival and uncontrolled differentiation of the transplanted stem cells. The combination of a scaffold with cells has been developed with a tendency for achieving greater survival and integration with the host tissue. We investigated the effect of Matrigel combined with neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro and in vivo. We compared the effect of different types of scaffold on the survival and differentiation of brain-derived NSCs in an in vitro culture. Subsequently, NSCs were transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice to detect graft survival and differentiation in vivo. Finally, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Matrigel alone, or Matrigel seeded with NSCs was injected into 48 subacute, clinically relevant rat models of SCI (16 rats per group). Matrigel supported cell survival and differentiation efficiently in vitro and in vivo. SCI rats transplanted with NSCs in Matrigel showed improved behavioral recovery and neuronal and reactive astrocyte marker expression levels compared to PBS- or Matrigel-transplanted rats. Functional repair and neuronal and reactive astrocyte marker expression was slightly improved in the Matrigel-alone group relative to the PBS group, but not statistically significantly. These data suggest that Matrigel is a promising scaffold material for cell transplantation to the injured spinal cord."

To study the effects of rhodioloside and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on spinal cord injury, a rat model of spinal cord injury was established using the Infinite Horizons method. After establishing the model, the rats were randomly divided into five groups. Rats in the control group were intragastrically injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (5 μL). PBS was injected at 6 equidistant points around 5 mm from the injury site and at a depth of 5 mm. Rats in the rhodioloside group were intragastrically injected with rhodioloside (5 g/kg) and intramuscularly injected with PBS. Rats in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) group were intramuscularly injected with PBS and intramuscularly with MSCs (8 × 106/mL in a 50-μL cell suspension). Rats in the Ad-HIF-MSC group were intragastrically injected with PBS and intramuscularly injected with HIF-1 adenovirus-infected MSCs. Rats in the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group were intramuscularly injected with MSCs infected with the HIF-1 adenovirus and intragastrically injected with rhodioloside. One week after treatment, exercise recovery was evaluated with a modified combined behavioral score scale. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Pischingert's methylene blue staining were used to detect any histological or pathological changes in spinal cord tissue. Levels of adenovirus IX and Sry mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and used to determine the number of adenovirus and mesenchymal stem cells that were transfected into the spinal cord. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to detect HIF-1 protein levels in the spinal cord. The results showed that: (1) compared with the other groups, the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group exhibited the highest combined behavioral score (P < 0.05), the most recovered tissue, and the greatest number of neurons, as indicated by Pischingert's methylene blue staining. (2) Compared with the PBS group, HIF-1 protein expression was greater in the rhodioloside group (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with the Ad-HIF-MSC group, Sry mRNA levels were higher in the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group (P < 0.05). These results confirm that rhodioloside combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can promote the recovery of spinal cord injury and activate the HIF-1 pathway to promote the survival of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and repair damaged neurons within spinal cord tissue. This experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China (approval No. 2015KYLL029) in June 2015."

Pharmacological induction of HSPs has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal loss and functional deficits in peripheral and central nervous system injuries. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of trehalose on spinal expression of HSP27, HSP70 and caspase-3 genes following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Methods Male rats weighing 250-300 g underwent laminectomy and were divided into four groups including sham, SCI (received SCI), vehicle (received SCI and phosphate buffer saline intrathecally) and trehalose (received 10 mM trehalose intrathecally following SCI). On days 1, 3 and 7 after injury, HSP27, HSP70 and caspase-3 genes transcripts were quantified in spinal cord tissues via a real-time PCR technique. In addition, locomotor function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale. Results SCI induced the expression of HSP27, HSP70 and caspase-3 genes and BBB score at all time points. Trehalose treatment upregulated HSP27, HSP70 genes expression at 1 day after SCI. Interestingly, a significant reduction in the expression of HSP27 and HSP70 genes was observed on days 3 and 7 following trauma compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.01). Caspase-3 gene showed a decrease in expression in the trehalose-treated group at all times. In addition, neurological function revealed an improvement after treatment with trehalose. Conclusion This study suggests that the neuroprotective effect of trehalose is mediated via regulation of HSP27 and HSP70, which are involved in cytoprotection and functional recovery following SCI."

It was hypothesized that inhibition of Eph signaling promotes cellular and behavioral recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: Lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury was performed on wildtype (WT) and EphA6 knockout (KO) mice. EphA6-Fc, Ephrin-A5-Fc fusion proteins, and sodium orthovanadate were used to alter the signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry and tissue explants revealed cellular changes. Rotarod tests demonstrated vestibulomotor function. Outcomes: The EphA6 receptor expression is upregulated following LFP. Uninjured EphA6 KO mice exhibit greater neurite density and clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc causes growth cone collapse in vitro. After LFP, EphA6 KO mice demonstrate longer neurites and decreased neuronal cell death and astrocytosis compared to WT mice. Blocking EphA signaling by soluble EphA6-Fc fusion protein reduces cell death and improves motor function following LFP whereas clustered Ephrin-A5-Fc exacerbates cell death and neurodegeneration. Sodium orthovanadate rescues growth cone collapse in vitro as well as cell death and neurodegeneration in vivo. Conclusions: Eph/Ephrin signaling plays an inhibitory role following TBI. Targeting the Eph signaling pathway with Fc fusion proteins and pharmacological agents can be a novel strategy to counter the damaging effects of TBI.

Although clinical evidence indicates that revascularization of the ischemic brain regions is crucial for functional recovery, no therapeutics that promote angiogenesis after cerebral stroke are currently available. Besides vascular growth factors, guidance molecules have been identified to regulate aspects of angiogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) and may provide targets for therapeutic angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of the neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo-A or one of its corresponding receptors, S1PR2, improves vascular sprouting and repair and reduces neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia in mice. These findings were reproduced in a therapeutic approach using intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibodies; such a therapy is currently in clinical testing for spinal cord injury. These results provide a basis for a therapeutic blockage of inhibitory guidance molecules to improve vascular and neural repair after ischemic CNS injuries."

The PTEN/AKT pathway-related proteins and their roles in miR-92b-3p regulation were also identified using western blotting and immunofluorescence in vitro through LY294002, an AKT inhibitor. The effect of miR-92b-3p was further determined in vivo according to the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) Scale and GAP43 and NF-200 expressions. miR-92b-3p was downregulated after ASCI, while PTEN showed a simultaneous opposing trend. Overexpression of miR-92b-3p downregulated PTEN expression and promoted phosphorylation of AKT, as well as the expression of GAP43 and NF-200 in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-92b-3p exerted its effect by targeting PTEN's 3'-untranslated regions and that this effect could be counteracted by AKT phosphorylation blocker LY294002 through western blotting and immunofluorescence. Moreover, miR-92b-3p could also improve the BBB scale as well as GAP43 and NF-200 expression levels in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-92b-3p promotes neurite growth and functional recovery through the PTEN/AKT pathway in ASCI."

The expression of miR-133b was significantly decreased in 4 d SCI group compared with that in sham-operation group (p<0.001). The RhoA expression was statistically increased in 4 d SCI group compared with that in sham-operation group (p<0.001), and it was partially impaired by using miR-133b compared with that in 4 d SCI group (p<0.001). Expressions of NF, GAP43, GFAP and MBP were remarkably higher in 4 d SCI group than those in sham-operation group (p<0.01), and they were also significantly increased in miR-133b group than those in 4 d SCI group (p<0.01). Besides, our data showed a significant increase of p-CREB/CREB, p-STAT3/STAT3, NF, GAP-43, GFAP and MBP in miR-133b group compared to those in 4 d SCI group, with statistical reduction of RhoA (p<0.05). We showed that exosomes derived from miR-133b-modified ADSCs can significantly promote the recovery of neurological function of SCI animals through affecting the signaling pathway related to axon regeneration and expressions of NF, GAP-43, GFAP and MBP."

Since macrophages are major inflammatory contributors to the acute spinal cord injury, and are the major phagocytic cells, we hypothesized that transplanting Schwann cells after macrophage depletion will improve cell survival and integration with host tissue after SCI. To test this hypothesis, rat models of contusive SCI at thoracic level 8 were randomly subjected to macrophage depletion or not. In rat subjected to macrophage depletion, liposomes filled with clodronate were intraperitoneally injected at 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18 days post injury. Rats not subjected to macrophage depletion were intraperitoneally injected with liposomes filled with phosphate buffered saline. Schwann cells were transplanted 1 week post injury in all rats. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected at thoracic level 5 to evalute axon regeneration. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor test, Gridwalk test, and sensory test using von Frey filaments were performed to assess functional recovery. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament, and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and also to visulize BDA-labelled axons. The GFP labeled Schwann cell and cyst and lesion volumes were quantified using stained slides. The numbers of BDA-positive axons were also quantified. At 8 weeks after Schwann cell transplantation, there was a significant reduction in cyst and lesion volumes in the combined treatment group compared to Schwann cell transplantation alone. These changes were not associated, however, with improved Schwann cell survival, axon growth, or locomotor recovery. Although combining Schwann cell transplantation with macrophage depletion does improve histopathology of the injury site, the effect on axon growth and behavioral recovery appears no better than what can be achieved with Schwann cell transplants alone."

In the present study, we evaluated its functions in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying its positive effects. Oral administration of UA to mice 1 h after SCI and thereafter once daily for 6 weeks enhanced the regaining of motor functions and axonal regrowth, and decreased astrogliosis. UA administration decreased levels of proinflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, in the injured spinal cord at the acute phase of inflammation and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways in the injured spinal cord.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported to play important roles in the formation of glia scar, but previous studies had paid more attention to the astrocytes. The present study aimed to observe the effects of S1P and S1P receptors (S1PRs) on proliferation of pericytes and investigate the underlying mechanism.

Therefore, a reliable prediction of the improvement in the acute phase could benefit patients. Physicians are unanimous in insisting that at the initial damage of the spinal cord (SC), the patient should be carefully evaluated in order to help selecting an appropriate neuroprotective treatment. However, currently, neurologic impairment after SCI is measured and classified by functional examination. The identification of prognostic biomarkers of SCI would help to designate SC injured patients and correlate to diagnosis and correct treatment. Some proteins have already been identified as good potential biomarkers of central nervous system injury, both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum. However, the problem for using them as biomarkers is the way they should be collected, as acquiring CSF through a lumbar puncture is significantly invasive. Remarkably, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as interesting biomarker candidates because of their stability in biological fluids and their tissue specificity. Several miRNAs have been identified to have their expressions altered in SCI in many animal models, making them promising candidates as biomarkers after SCI. Moreover, there are yet no effective therapies for SCI. It is already known that altered lysophospholipids (LPs) signaling are involved in the biology of disorders, such as inflammation. Reports have demonstrated that LPs when locally distributed can regulate SCI repair and key secondary injury processes such as apoptosis and inflammation, and so could become in the future new therapeutic approaches for treating SCI."

WIN55212-2, an agonist for CB1 and CB2 receptors, has been demonstrated with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in multiple neurological diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether WIN55212-2 could promote functional recovery after traumatic SCI via inhibition of the GAPDH/Siah1 signaling. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from 25mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. Our results showed that WIN55212-2 alleviated the activation of GAPDH/Siah1 signaling pathway after SCI, as indicated by the reduction in GAPDH nuclear expression, GAPDH-Siah1 complex formation and iNOS protein expression. Furthermore, WIN55212-2 reduced apoptosis, production of IL-1β and TNF-α and activation of NF-κB signaling in the spinal cord after SCI. The behavioral tests showed that WIN55212-2 improved the functional recovery after traumatic SCI as indicated by sustained increase in the locomotor scores.

In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in preliminary clinical trials in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the combined administration of recombinant adenoviral vectors (Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG) encoding the neurotrophic/angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and angiogenin ( ANG) was found to slow the development of neurological deficits. These results suggest that there may be positive effects of this combination of genes in posttraumatic spinal cord regeneration. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG combination therapy on motor function recovery and reactivity of astrocytes in a rat model of SCI. METHODS Spinal cord injury was induced in adult Wistar rats by the weight-drop method. Rats (n = 51) were divided into 2 groups: the experimental group (Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG) and the control group (Ad5-GFP [green fluorescent protein]). Recovery of motor function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. The duration and intensity of infectivity and gene expression from the injected vectors were assessed by immunofluorescent detection of GFP. Reactivity of glial cells was assessed by changes in the number of immunopositive cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100β, aquaporin 4 (AQP4), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4. The level of S100β mRNA expression in the spinal cord was estimated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Partial recovery of motor function was observed 30 days after surgery in both groups. However, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were 35.9% higher in the Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG group compared with the control group. Specific GFP signal was observed at distances of up to 5 mm in the rostral and caudal directions from the points of injection. A 1.5 to 2.0-fold increase in the number of GFAP+, S100β+, and AQP4+ cells was observed in the white and gray matter at a distance of up to 5 mm from the center of the lesion site in the caudal and rostral directions. At 30 days after injury, a 2-fold increase in S100β transcripts was observed in the Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS Intraspinal injection of recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding VEGF and ANG stimulates functional recovery after traumatic SCI. The increased number of S100β+ astrocytes induced by this approach may be a beneficial factor for maintaining the survival and function of neurons. Therefore, gene therapy with Ad5-VEGF+Ad5-ANG vectors is an effective therapeutic method for SCI treatment."

Seven weeks after the transplantation (8 weeks after SCI), rats in the Wnt3a-MSC group achieved significantly higher average scores in the motor behavior tests than those in the other groups (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescent stains showed greater immunoreactivity of ChAT, GAP43, and MAP2 in the Wnt3a-MSC group than in the other groups. RT-PCR and western blots revealed greater expression of these proteins in the Wnt3a-MSC group than in the other groups (p < 0.05). Wnt3a-secreting hMSC transplantation considerably improved neurological recovery and axonal regeneration in a rat SCI model."

Although a scaffold is sometimes used for retaining transplanted cells in damaged tissue, it is also known to induce redundant immunoreactions during the degradation processes. In this study, the authors prepared cell sheets made of BMSCs, which are transplantable without a scaffold, and investigated their effects on axonal regeneration, glial scar formation, and functional recovery in a completely transected SCI model in rats. METHODS BMSC sheets were prepared from the bone marrow of female Fischer 344 rats using ascorbic acid and were cryopreserved until the day of transplantation. A gelatin sponge (GS), as a control, or BMSC sheet was transplanted into a 2-mm-sized defect of the spinal cord at the T-8 level. Axonal regeneration and glial scar formation were assessed 2 and 8 weeks after transplantation by immunohistochemical analyses using anti-Tuj1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies, respectively. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. RESULTS The BMSC sheets promoted axonal regeneration at 2 weeks after transplantation, but there was no significant difference in the number of Tuj1-positive axons between the sheet- and GS-transplanted groups. At 8 weeks after transplantation, Tuj1-positive axons elongated across the sheet, and their numbers were significantly greater in the sheet group than in the GS group. The areas of GFAP-positive glial scars in the sheet group were significantly reduced compared with those of the GS group at both time points. Finally, hindlimb locomotor function was ameliorated in the sheet group at 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study indicate that an ascorbic acid-induced BMSC sheet is effective in the treatment of SCI and enables autologous transplantation without requiring a scaffold."

Previously, we observed that age alters the balance of destructive (M1) and protective (M2) macrophages; however, the age-related pathophysiology in SCI is poorly understood. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) contributes to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage and macrophage activation in neurotrauma. Further, NOX and ROS increase with central nervous system age. Here, we found significantly higher ROS generation in 14 versus 4-month-old (MO) mice after contusion SCI. Notably, NOX2 increased in 14 MO ROS-producing macrophages suggesting that macrophages and NOX contribute to SCI oxidative stress. Indicators of lipid peroxidation, a downstream cytotoxic effect of ROS accumulation, were significantly higher in 14 versus 4 MO SCI mice. We also detected a higher percentage of ROS-producing M2 (Arginase-1-positive) macrophages in 14 versus 4 MO mice, a previously unreported SCI phenotype, and increased M1 (CD16/32-positive) macrophages with age. Thus, NOX and ROS are age-related mediators of SCI pathophysiology and normally protective M2 macrophages may potentiate secondary injury through ROS generation in the aged injured spinal cord."

The present study investigated whether neurological function following a severe spinal cord injury improves after utilizing either a durotomy to decompress the intradural space and/or a duraplasty to maintain proper flow of cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS Sixty-four adult female rats (n = 64) were randomly assigned to receive either a 3- or 5-level decompressive laminectomy (Groups A and B), laminectomy + durotomy (Groups C and D), or laminectomy + duraplasty with graft (Group E and F) at 24 hours following a severe thoracic contusion injury (200 kilodynes). Duraplasty involved the use of DuraSeal, a hydrogel dural sealant. Uninjured and injured control groups were included (Groups G, H). Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed by open field locomotor testing (BBB) and CatWalk gait analysis at 35 days postinjury. Bladder function was analyzed and bladder wall thickness was assessed histologically. At 35 days postinjury, mechanical and thermal allodynia were assessed by the Von Frey hair filament and hotplate paw withdrawal tests, respectively. Thereafter, the spinal cords were dissected, examined for gross anomalies at the injury site, and harvested for histological analyses to assess lesion volumes and white matter sparing. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS There was no significant improvement in motor function recovery in any treatment groups compared with injured controls. CatWalk gait analysis indicated a significant decrease in interlimb coordination in Groups B, C, and D (p < 0.05) and swing speed in Groups A, B, and D. Increased mechanical pain sensitivity was observed in Groups A, C, and F (p < 0.05). Rats in Group C also developed thermal pain hypersensitivity. Examination of spinal cords demonstrated increased lesion volumes in Groups C and F and increased white matter sparing in Group E (p < 0.05). The return of bladder automaticity was similar in all groups. Examination of the injury site during tissue harvest revealed that, in some instances, expansion of the hydrogel dural sealant caused compression of the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS Surgical decompression provided no benefit in terms of neurological improvement in the setting of a severe thoracic spinal cord contusion injury in rats at 24 hours postinjury. Decompressive laminectomy and durotomy did not improve motor function recovery, and rats in both of these treatment modalities developed neuropathic pain. Performing a durotomy also led to increased lesion volumes. Placement of DuraSeal was shown to cause compression in some rats in the duraplasty treatment groups. Decompressive duraplasty of 3 levels does not affect functional outcomes after injury but did increase white matter sparing. Decompressive duraplasty of 5 levels led to neuropathic pain development and increased lesion volumes. Further comparison of dural repair techniques is necessary."

The most prominent example, Nogo-A, imposes an inhibitory cue for nerve fibre growth via two independent domains: Nogo-A-Δ20 (residues 544-725 of the rat Nogo-A sequence) and Nogo-66 (residues 1026-1091). Inhibitory signalling from these domains causes a collapse of the neuronal growth cone via individual receptor complexes, centred around sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) for Nogo-A-Δ20 and Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) for Nogo-66. Whereas the helical conformation of Nogo-66 has been studied extensively, only little structural information is available for the Nogo-A-Δ20 region. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess potential residual structural propensities of the intrinsically disordered Nogo-A-Δ20. Using triple resonance experiments, we were able to assign 94% of the non-proline backbone residues. While secondary structure analysis and relaxation measurements highlighted the intrinsically disordered character of Nogo-A-Δ20, three stretches comprising residues 561EAIQESL567, 639EAMNVALKALGT650, and 693SNYSEIAK700 form transient α-helical structures.

Low-energy ESWT increases expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cultured endothelial cells. The VEGF stimulates not only endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis but also neural cells to induce neuroprotective effects. A previous study by these authors demonstrated that low-energy ESWT promoted expression of VEGF in damaged neural tissue and improved locomotor function after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the neuroprotective mechanisms in the injured spinal cord produced by low-energy ESWT are still unknown. In the present study, the authors investigated the cell specificity of VEGF expression in injured spinal cords and angiogenesis induced by low-energy ESWT. They also examined the neuroprotective effects of low-energy ESWT on cell death, axonal damage, and white matter sparing as well as the therapeutic effect for improvement of sensory function following SCI. METHODS Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the SCI group (SCI only) and SCI-SW group (low-energy ESWT applied after SCI). Thoracic SCI was produced using a New York University Impactor. Low-energy ESWT was applied to the injured spinal cord 3 times a week for 3 weeks after SCI. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan open-field locomotor score for 42 days after SCI. Mechanical and thermal allodynia in the hindpaw were evaluated for 42 days. Double staining for VEGF and various cell-type markers (NeuN, GFAP, and Olig2) was performed at Day 7; TUNEL staining was also performed at Day 7. Immunohistochemical staining for CD31, α-SMA, and 5-HT was performed on spinal cord sections taken 42 days after SCI. Luxol fast blue staining was performed at Day 42. RESULTS Low-energy ESWT significantly improved not only locomotion but also mechanical and thermal allodynia following SCI. In the double staining, expression of VEGF was observed in NeuN-, GFAP-, and Olig2-labeled cells. Low-energy ESWT significantly promoted CD31 and α-SMA expressions in the injured spinal cords. In addition, low-energy ESWT significantly reduced the TUNEL-positive cells in the injured spinal cords. Furthermore, the immunodensity of 5-HT-positive axons was significantly higher in the animals treated by low-energy ESWT. The areas of spared white matter were obviously larger in the SCI-SW group than in the SCI group, as indicated by Luxol fast blue staining. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggested that low-energy ESWT promotes VEGF expression in various neural cells and enhances angiogenesis in damaged neural tissue after SCI. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of VEGF induced by low-energy ESWT can suppress cell death and axonal damage and consequently improve locomotor and sensory functions after SCI. Thus, low-energy ESWT can be a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of SCI."

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SCI using a weight drop device and then hAMSCs, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were immediately injected into the contused dorsal spinal cord at 2 mm rostral and 2 mm caudal to the injury site. Our results indicated that transplanted hAMSCs migrated in the host spinal cord without differentiating into neuronal or glial cells. Compared with the control group, hAMSCs transplantation significantly decreased the numbers of ED1+ macrophages/microglia and caspase-3+ cells. In addition, hAMSCs transplantation significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the injured spinal cord, and promoted both angiogenesis and axonal regeneration. These effects were associated with significantly improved neurobehavioral recovery in the hAMSCs transplantation group. These results show that transplantation of hAMSCs provides neuroprotective effects in rats after SCI, and could be candidate stem cells for the treatment of SCI."

It is associated with a variety of injurious conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for spinal cord injury (SCI). Sivelestat sodium (SIV), a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor initially used to treat acute lung injury, has been known to protect against compression-induced and ischemic SCI. However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling in the spinal cord. The behavioral tests showed that SIV promoted functional recovery after traumatic SCI as reflected in the sustained increase in the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores throughout the observation period. In conclusion, our results reveal GAPDH/Siah1 as a novel signaling pathway during the progression of SCI, which can be blocked by SIV."

CaP coating was grown on sutures, and NT-3 binding and release were characterized in vitro. Then, the NT-3-loaded sutures were tested in a complete SCI model. Rats were analyzed for functional improvement and axonal growth into the grafts. The CaP-coated sutures exhibited a burst release of NT-3, followed by a sustained release for at least 20 days. Functionally, the rats with PNGs + NT-3-loaded sutures and the rats treated with PNGs scored significantly higher than controls on day 56 postoperatively. However, functional scores in rats treated with PNGs + NT-3-loaded suture were not significantly different from those of rats treated with PNGs alone. Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) labeling rostral to the graft was not observed in any controls, but CTB labeling rostral to the graft was observed in almost all rats that had had a PNG. Neurofilament labeling on transverse sections of the graft revealed that the rats treated with the NT-3-loaded sutures had significantly more axons per graft than rats treated with an NT-3 injection and rats without NT-3.

To understand genetic determinants of mammalian CNS axon regeneration, we completed an unbiased RNAi gene-silencing screen across most phosphatases in the genome. We identified one known and 17 previously unknown phosphatase suppressors of injury-induced CNS axon growth. Silencing Inpp5f (Sac2) leads to robust enhancement of axon regeneration and growth cone reformation. Results from cultured Inpp5f(-/-) neurons confirm lentiviral shRNA results from the screen. Consistent with the nonoverlapping substrate specificity between Inpp5f and PTEN, rapamycin does not block enhanced regeneration in Inpp5f(-/-) neurons, implicating mechanisms independent of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Inpp5f(-/-) mice develop normally, but show enhanced anatomical and functional recovery after mid-thoracic dorsal hemisection injury. More serotonergic axons sprout and/or regenerate caudal to the lesion level, and greater numbers of corticospinal tract axons sprout rostral to the lesion. Functionally, Inpp5f-null mice exhibit enhanced recovery of motor functions in both open-field and rotarod tests. This study demonstrates the potential of an unbiased high-throughput functional screen to identify endogenous suppressors of CNS axon growth after injury, and reveals Inpp5f (Sac2) as a novel suppressor of CNS axon repair after spinal cord injury. Significance statement: The extent of axon regeneration is a critical determinant of neurological recovery from injury, and is extremely limited in the adult mammalian CNS. We describe an unbiased gene-silencing screen that uncovered novel molecules suppressing axonal regeneration. Inpp5f (Sac2) gene deletion promoted recovery from spinal cord injury with no side effects. The mechanism of action is distinct from another lipid phosphatase implicated in regeneration, PTEN. This opens new pathways for investigation in spinal cord injury research. Furthermore the screening methodology can be applied on a genome wide scale to discovery the entire set of mammalian genes contributing to axonal regeneration."

The spinal cord was harvested 8 weeks after transplantation. In a behavioral assessment, dogs treated with cADMSCs + chABC and cADMSCs alone showed significantly better functional recovery 8 weeks after transplantation compared with the control and chABC groups (P < 0.05). In addition, the combination of cADMSCs and chABC increased the expression of digested CSPGs (2B6), β3 tubulin, and NF-M. However, the levels of COX2 (P < 0.05), and tumor necrosis factor-α was higher in the treatment groups than in the control. In conclusion, transplantation of cADMSCs + chABC was more effective in improving clinical signs and neural regeneration, but a strategy for anti-inflammation after the treatment for chronic SCI would be needed for further improvement."

We hereby hypothesize that localized delivery of FTY720 can promote SCI recovery by reducing pathological astrogliosis. The mechanistic functions of FTY720 were investigated in vitro and in vivo utilizing immunofluorescence, histology, MRI and behavioral analysis. The in vitro study showed that FTY720 can reduce astrocyte migration and proliferation activated by S1P. FTY720 can prolong internalization of S1P1 and exert antagonistic effects on S1P1. In vivo study of SCI animal models demonstrated that local delivery of FTY720 with polycaprolactone (PCL) membrane significantly decreased S1P1 expression and glial scarring compared with the control group. Furthermore, FTY720-treated groups exhibited less cavitation volume and neuron loss, which significantly improved recovery of motor function. These findings demonstrated that localized delivery of FTY720 can promote SCI recovery by targeting the S1P1 receptor of astrocytes, provide a new therapeutic strategy for SCI treatment."

Because distinct differences exist in the neuroanatomy and immunological responses between rodents and primates, it is critical to determine the effectiveness and safety of allografted embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NS/PCs (ESC-NS/PCs) in a nonhuman primate SCI model. In the present study, common marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group). In the control group, phosphate-buffered saline was injected instead of cells. In the presence of a low-dose of tacrolimus, several grafted cells survived without tumorigenicity and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Significant differences were found in the transverse areas of luxol fast blue-positive myelin sheaths, neurofilament-positive axons, corticospinal tract fibers, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive vessels at the lesion epicenter between the transplantation and control groups. Immunoelectron microscopic examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control group. In addition, a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay indicated that ESC-NS/PCs modulated the allogeneic immune rejection. Taken together, our results indicate that allogeneic transplantation of ESC-NS/PCs from a nonhuman primate promoted functional recovery after SCI without tumorigenicity. This study demonstrates that allogeneic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) promoted functional recovery after transplantation into the injured spinal cord in nonhuman primates. ESC-NS/PCs were chosen because ESC-NS/PCs are one of the controls for induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NS/PCs and because ESC derivatives are possible candidates for clinical use. This translational research using an allograft model of a nonhuman primate is critical for clinical application of grafting NS/PCs derived from various allogeneic pluripotent stem cells, especially induced pluripotent stem cells, into injured spinal cord at the subacute phase."

In addition, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the CSF were evaluated at 2 weeks. Intranasally administered BMSCs were confirmed within spinal cord sections at both 2 and 4 weeks. The highest number, which was detected in the intrathecal BMSC-treated group at 2 weeks, was significantly higher than that in all the other groups. The BBB score of the intranasal BMSC-treated group showed statistically significant improvements by 1 week compared with the control group. However, in the final BBB scores, there was a statistically significant difference only between the intrathecal BMSC-treated group and the control group. The cavity ratios in the BMSC-treated groups were smaller than those of the control groups, but the authors did not find any significant differences in the NGF and BDNF levels in the CSF among the treatment and control groups. BMSCs reached the injured spinal cord through the intranasal route and contributed to the recovery of hind limb motor function and lesion cavity reduction.

Recent studies have demonstrated that low-energy ESWT upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and promotes angiogenesis and functional recovery in myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease. Many previous reports suggested that VEGF produces a neuroprotective effect to reduce secondary neural tissue damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether low-energy ESWT promotes VEGF expression and neuroprotection and improves locomotor recovery after SCI. Sixty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group (laminectomy only), sham-SW group (low-energy ESWT applied after laminectomy), SCI group (SCI only), and SCI-SW group (low-energy ESWT applied after SCI). Thoracic spinal cord contusion injury was inflicted using an impactor. Low-energy ESWT was applied to the injured spinal cord 3 times a week for 3 weeks. Locomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) Scale (open field locomotor score) at different time points over 42 days after SCI. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess neural tissue damage in the spinal cord. Neuronal loss was investigated by immunostaining for NeuN. The mRNA expressions of VEGF and its receptor, Flt-1, in the spinal cord were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunostaining for VEGF was performed to evaluate VEGF protein expression in the spinal cord. In both the sham and sham-SW groups, no animals showed locomotor impairment on BBB scoring. Histological analysis of H & E and NeuN stainings in the sham-SW group confirmed that no neural tissue damage was induced by the low-energy ESWT. Importantly, animals in the SCI-SW group demonstrated significantly better locomotor improvement than those in the SCI group at 7, 35, and 42 days after injury (p < 0.05). The number of NeuN-positive cells in the SCI-SW group was significantly higher than that in the SCI group at 42 days after injury (p < 0.05). In addition, mRNA expressions of VEGF and Flt-1 were significantly increased in the SCI-SW group compared with the SCI group at 7 days after injury (p < 0.05). The expression of VEGF protein in the SCI-SW group was significantly higher than that in the SCI group at 7 days (p < 0.01). The present study showed that low-energy ESWT significantly increased expressions of VEGF and Flt-1 in the spinal cord without any detrimental effect. Furthermore, it significantly reduced neuronal loss in damaged neural tissue and improved locomotor function after SCI. These results suggested that low-energy ESWT enhances the neuroprotective effect of VEGF in reducing secondary injury and leads to better locomotor recovery following SCI. This study provides the first evidence that low-energy ESWT can be a safe and promising therapeutic strategy for SCI."

G-CSF and GM-CSF were administered via intraperitoneal injection immediately after SCI. The effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on functional recovery, glial scar formation, and axonal regeneration were evaluated and compared. The rats in Groups 3 and 4 showed better functional recovery and more decreased cavity sizes than those in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Both G-CSF and GM-CSF suppressed intensive expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein around the cavity at 4 weeks and reduced the expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (p < 0.05). Also, early administration of G-CSF and GM-CSF protected axon fibers from destructive injury and facilitated axonal regeneration. There were no significant differences in comparisons of functional recovery, glial scar formation, and axonal regeneration between G-CSF and GM-CSF. G-CSF suppressed glial scar formation after SCI in rats, possibly by restricting the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which might facilitate functional recovery from SCI. GM-CSF and G-CSF had similar effects on glial scar formation and functional recovery after SCI, suggesting that G-CSF can potentially be substituted for GM-CSF in the treatment of SCI."

Cell-based gene therapy is becoming a major focus for the treatment of SCI. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a promising stem cell type useful for repairing SCI. However, the effects of BMSCs transplants are likely limited because of low transplant survival after SCI. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a multifunctional growth factor which can facilitate neuronal and BMSCs survival, promote axonal growth, prevent activation of the astrocyte lineage, and enhance the delivery of neurotrophic factors in BMSCs. However, treatment of SCI with Shh alone also has limited effects on recovery, because the protein is cleared quickly. In this study, we investigated the use of BMSCs overexpressing the Shh transgene (Shh-BMSCs) in the treatment of rats with SCI, which could stably secrete Shh and thereby enhance the effects of BMSCs, in an attempt to combine the advantages of Shh and BMSCs and so to promote functional recovery. After Shh-BMSCs treatment of SCI via the subarachnoid, we detected significantly greater damage recovery compared with that seen in rats treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and BMSCs. Use of Shh-BMSCs increased the expression and secretion of Shh, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), improved the behavioral function, enhanced the BMSCs survival, promoted the expression level of neurofilament 200 (NF200), and reduced the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Thus, our results indicated that Shh-BMSCs enhanced recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats and could be a potential valuable therapeutic intervention for SCI in humans."

Chronic treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently (P < 0.05) attenuated the decrease in body weight, urine output, footprint analysis, sperm count and organ weight (testis, seminal vesicle and urinary bladder). It significantly improved (P < 0.05) the nociceptive threshold, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity. The decreased activity of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and membrane-bound inorganic phosphate were significantly (P < 0.05) restored by chrysin treatment. SCI resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in lipid peroxidase, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, and bax whereas expression of bcl-2 and caspase-3 were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced.

Human stem cells, derived from the umbilical cord, are one of the strong candidates used in cell therapy for spinal cord injury because of weak immunogenicity and ready availability. We sought to evaluate the use of human umbilical cord blood stem cells (HUCBSCs) to attenuate the neurological effects of spinal cord ischaemia induced by high thoracic aorta occlusion. Forty Wistar rats were randomized to receive intrathecal injection of 10 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1 × 10(4) HUCBSCs, 30 min before (Tpre group: n = 10) and 30 min after (Tpos group: n = 10) descending thoracic aorta occlusion by intraluminal balloon during 12 min. Control groups received only PBS solution (Cpre group: n = 10; and Cpos group: n = 10). During a 28-day observational period, motor function was assessed by a functional grading scale (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan). Segments of thoracolumbar spinal cord specimens were analysed for histological and immunohistochemical assessment for detection and quantification of human haematopoietic cells (CD45(+)) and apoptosis (transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labelling). Overall mortality was 12 animals (30%). Therefore, the observational sample was composed of 28 animals. All groups showed similar incidence of paraplegia and mortality. The mean motor function scores showed no difference during time between the animals of each group, excepting for the Tpos group, which improved from 8.14 (±8.6) to 14.28 (±9.8) (P < 0.01). A treatment-by-time interaction was detected among animals that received HUCBSCs 30 min after ischaemia, with BBB scores higher from Days 14 to 28 compared with the first observational day with statistical difference (P = 0.01). Number of viable neurons was higher in the Tpos group (P = 0.14) and the incidence of apoptosis was lower in the same animals (P = 0.048), but showed no difference with its respective control. We confirmed the presence of CD45(+) cells 4 weeks after intrathecal injection in both therapeutic groups but mainly in the Tpos group. Intrathecal transplantation of HUCBSCs is feasible, and it improved spinal cord function, when they were delivered 30 min after spinal cord ischaemia, in a model of endovascular descending thoracic aorta occlusion in rats. Human umbilical cord blood is one of the potentially useful sources of stem cells for therapy of spinal cord ischaemia."

The present study examines whether this novel dietary strategy provides significant antinociceptive benefits in rats experiencing SCI-induced pain. Rats were fed control chow or chow enriched with O3PUFAs for 8weeks before being subjected to sham or cord contusion surgeries, continuing the same diets after surgery for another 8 more weeks. The paw sensitivity to noxious heat was quantified for at least 8weeks post-SCI using the Hargreaves test. We found that SCI rats consuming the preventive O3PUFA-enriched diet exhibited a significant reduction in thermal hyperalgesia compared to those consuming the normal diet. Functional neurometabolomic profiling revealed a distinctive deregulation in the metabolism of endocannabinoids (eCB) and related N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) at 8weeks post-SCI. We found that O3PUFAs consumption led to a robust accumulation of novel NAE precursors, including the glycerophospho-containing docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (DPEA), and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The tissue levels of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the antihyperalgesic phenotype. In addition, rats consuming the O3PUFA-rich diet showed reduced sprouting of nociceptive fibers containing CGRP and dorsal horn neuron p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, well-established biomarkers of pain. The spinal cord levels of inositols were positively correlated with thermal hyperalgesia, supporting their role as biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain. Notably, the O3PUFA-rich dietary intervention reduced the levels of these metabolites. Collectively, these results demonstrate the prophylactic value of dietary O3PUFA against SCI-mediated chronic pain."

The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal transplantation site of NS/PCs for the treatment of SCI. Wild-type mice were generated with contusive SCI at the T10 level, and NS/PCs were derived from fetal transgenic mice. These NS/PCs ubiquitously expressed ffLuc-cp156 protein (Venus and luciferase fusion protein) and so could be detected by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 9 days postinjury. NS/PCs (low: 250,000 cells per mouse; high: 1 million cells per mouse) were grafted into the spinal cord at the lesion epicenter (E) or at rostral and caudal (RC) sites. Phosphate-buffered saline was injected into E as a control. Motor functional recovery was better in each of the transplantation groups (E-Low, E-High, RC-Low, and RC-High) than in the control group. The photon counts of the grafted NS/PCs were similar in each of the four transplantation groups, suggesting that the survival of NS/PCs was fairly uniform when more than a certain threshold number of cells were transplanted. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that brain-derived neurotropic factor expression was higher in the RC segment than in the E segment, and this may underlie why NS/PCs more readily differentiated into neurons than into astrocytes in the RC group. The location of the transplantation site did not affect the area of spared fibers, angiogenesis, or the expression of any other mediators. These findings indicated that the microenvironments of the E and RC sites are able to support NS/PCs transplanted during the subacute phase of SCI similarly. Optimally, a certain threshold number of NS/PCs should be grafted into the E segment to avoid damaging sites adjacent to the lesion during the injection procedure."

In an attempt to further characterize the multiple functions of L1 after severe SCI we analyzed locomotor functions and measured axonal regrowth/sprouting and sparing, glial scarring, and synaptic remodeling at 6 weeks after severe spinal cord compression injury at the T7-9 levels of L1-deficient mice (L1-/y) and their wild-type (L1+/y) littermates, as well as mice that overexpress L1 under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter (L1tg) and their wild-type littermates (L1+/+). No differences were found in the locomotor scale score and single frame motion analysis between L1-/y and L1+/y mice during 6 weeks after SCI, most likely due to the very low expression of L1 in the adult spinal cord of wild-type mice. L1tg mice, however, showed better locomotor recovery than their L1+/+ littermates, being associated with enhanced numbers of catecholaminergic axons in the lumbar spinal cord, but not of cholinergic, GABAergic or glutamatergic terminals around motoneuron cell bodies in the lumbar spinal cord. Additionally, no difference between L1tg and L1+/+ mice was detectable in dieback of corticospinal tract axons. Neuronal L1 overexpression did not influence the size of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytic scar 6 weeks after injury. We conclude that neuronal overexpression of L1 improves functional recovery from SCI by increasing catecholaminergic axonal regrowth/sprouting and/or sparing of severed axons without affecting the glial scar size."

For example, many of the drugs used to treat SCI may interfere with cognitive rehabilitation, and conversely drugs that are used to control seizures in TBI patients may undermine locomotor recovery after SCI. The current paper presents an experimental animal model for combined SCI and TBI to help drive mechanistic studies of dual diagnosis. Rats received a unilateral SCI (75 kdyn) at C5 vertebral level, a unilateral TBI (2.0 mm depth, 4.0 m/s velocity impact on the forelimb sensori-motor cortex), or both SCI+TBI. TBI was placed either contralateral or ipsilateral to the SCI. Behavioral recovery was examined using paw placement in a cylinder, grooming, open field locomotion, and the IBB cereal eating test. Over 6weeks, in the paw placement test, SCI+contralateral TBI produced a profound deficit that failed to recover, but SCI+ipsilateral TBI increased the relative use of the paw on the SCI side. In the grooming test, SCI+contralateral TBI produced worse recovery than either lesion alone even though contralateral TBI alone produced no observable deficit. In the IBB forelimb test, SCI+contralateral TBI revealed a severe deficit that recovered in 3 weeks. For open field locomotion, SCI alone or in combination with TBI resulted in an initial deficit that recovered in 2 weeks. Thus, TBI and SCI affected forelimb function differently depending upon the test, reflecting different neural substrates underlying, for example, exploratory paw placement and stereotyped grooming. Concurrent SCI and TBI had significantly different effects on outcomes and recovery, depending upon laterality of the two lesions. Recovery of function after cervical SCI was retarded by the addition of a moderate TBI in the contralateral hemisphere in all tests, but forepaw placements were relatively increased by an ipsilateral TBI relative to SCI alone, perhaps due to the dual competing injuries influencing the use of both forelimbs. These findings emphasize the complexity of recovery from combined CNS injuries, and the possible role of plasticity and laterality in rehabilitation, and provide a start towards a useful preclinical model for evaluating effective therapies for combine SCI and TBI."

Here we characterize behavioral function, inflammation, myelin status and axonal viability following bilateral injection of 0.20 mg/mL ethidium bromide or saline into the ventral white matter (VWM) of female C57Bl/6 mice. EB-induced VWM demyelination significantly reduced spared VWM and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores persisting out to 2 months. Chronic hindlimb dysfunction was accompanied by a persistent inflammatory response (demonstrated by CD45(+) immunofluorescence) and axonal loss (demonstrated by NF-M immunofluorescence and electron microscopy; EM). These cellular responses differ from the rat where inflammation resolves by 3-4 weeks and axon loss is minimal following EB demyelination. As these data suggest that EB-injection in the mouse spinal cord is a non-remyelinating lesion, we sought to ask whether wheel running could promote recovery by enhancing plasticity of local lumbar circuitry independent of remyelination. This did not occur as BMS and Treadscan assessment revealed no significant effect of wheel running on recovery. However, this study defines the importance of descending ventral motor pathways to locomotor function in the mouse as VWM loss results in a chronic hindlimb deficit."

Recent experiments in the local application of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) in models of sciatic nerve transection in rats have suggested their beneficial role in nerve regeneration, although the effects of variable doses of stem cells on peripheral nerve regeneration have never been specifically evaluated in the literature. In this paper, the authors evaluated the dose-dependent role of BM-MNCs in peripheral nerve regeneration in a model of sciatic nerve transection in rats. The right sciatic nerve of 60 adult female Wistar rats (randomized into 2 test groups and 1 control group, 20 rats in each group) underwent transection under an operating microscope. The cut ends of the nerve were approximated using 2 epineural microsutures. The gap was filled with low-dose (5 million BM-MNCs/100 μl phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) rat BM-MNCs in one group, high-dose (10 million BM-MNCs/100 μl PBS) rat BM-MNCs in another group, and only PBS in the control group, and the approximated nerve ends were sealed using fibrin glue. Histological assessment was performed after 30 days by using semiquantitative and morphometric analyses and was done to assess axonal regeneration, percentage of myelinated fibers, axonal diameter, fiber diameter, and myelin thickness at distal-most sites (10 mm from site of repair), intermediate distal sites (5 mm distal to the repair site), and site of repair. The recovery of nerve cell architecture after nerve anastomosis was far better in the high-dose BM-MNC group than in the low-dose BM-MNC and control groups, and it was most evident (p < 0.02 in the majority of the parameters [3 of 4]) at the distal-most site. Overall, the improvement in myelin thickness was most significant with incremental dosage of BM-MNCs, and was evident at the repair, intermediate distal, and distal-most sites (p = 0.001). This study emphasizes the role of BM-MNCs, which can be isolated easily from bone marrow aspirates, in peripheral nerve injury and highlights their dose-dependent facilitation of nerve regeneration."

The present study examined whether Taxol combined with transplantation of hUCMSCs would produce synergistic effects on recovery and which mechanisms were involved in the effect. A total of 32 rats subjected to SCI procedures were assigned to one of the following four treatment groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, control), hUCMSCs, Taxol, or Taxol+hUCMSCs. Immediately after injury, hUCMSCs were transplanted into the injury site and Taxol was administered intrathecally for 4 weeks. Locomotor recovery was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor (BBB) rating scale. Survival of the transplanted human cells and the host glial reaction in the injured spinal cord were studied by immunohistochemistry. Treatment with Taxol, hUCMSCs or Taxol+hUCMSCs reduced the extent of astrocytic activation, increased axonal preservation and decreased the number of caspase-3(+) and ED-1(+) cells, but these effects were more pronounced in the Taxol+hUCMSCs group. Behavioral analyses showed that rats in the Taxol+hUCMSCs group showed better motor performance than rats treated with hUCMSCs or Taxol only.

Oral administration of FTY720 shortly after contusion SCI significantly improved motor function recovery, as assessed by both Basso Mouse Scale scores and Rotarod Performance test results. FTY720 induced lymphopenia and reduced T-cell infiltration in the spinal cord after SCI but did not affect the early infiltration of neutrophils and the activation of microglia. In addition, plasma levels and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord after SCI were not attenuated by FTY720. Vascular permeability and astrocyte accumulation were both decreased by FTY720 in the injured spinal cord. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were not solely dependent on immune modulation, as confirmed by the demonstration that FTY720 also ameliorated motor function after SCI in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency.

Our work is consistent with studies suggesting that astrogliosis is an important event after SCI that limits tissue damage and lesion spreading."

Neurogenic bladder following spinal cord injury is the main problem decreasing the quality of life for patients with spinal cord injury, but there are no clear data using stem cell transplantation for the improvement of neurogenic bladder for in vivo studies and the clinical setting.The purpose of this study was to delineate the effect of human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) transplantation on the restoration of neurogenic bladder and impaired hindlimb function after spinal cord contusion of rats and the relationship between neurotrophic factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and bladder and hindlimb functions. Modified moderate contusion injury were performed on the thoracic spinal cord of Sprague-Dawley rats using MASCIS impactor and hMSCs, human fibroblasts or phosphate-buffered saline were transplanted into injured spinal cord 9 days after injury for hMSC and two control groups respectively. Ladder test showed more rapid restoration of hindlimb function in hMSC group than in control group, but Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score and coupling score were not different significantly among hMSC and two control groups. Neurogenic bladder was not improved in either group. ED1 positive macrophages were significantly reduced in hMSC group than in two control groups, but ELISA and RT-PCR studies revealed BDNF and NT-3 levels in spinal cord and bladder were not different among hMSC and two control groups regardless the experimental duration. hMSC transplantation was effective in reducing inflammatory reaction after spinal cord contusion of rats but not sufficient to recover locomotor and bladder dysfunction.

After traumatic injury to the CNS, such as spinal cord injury, persistent release of ATP from damaged neurons and activated glial cells occurs, inducing detrimental and/or beneficial effects via activation of ionotropic (P2XR) and metabotropic purinergic receptors. In this study, we show a decrease in GLAST mRNA in the lesion center and caudal portions at 24 h post-spinal cord injury. In an in vitro system, the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate and astrocytic GLAST mRNA levels were significantly decreased after exposure to ATP and its P2X(7)R agonist, 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP. ATP- or 2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP-induced inhibitory effect on GLAST mRNA expression was blocked by the irreversible P2X(7)R blocker, oxidized ATP, or when P2X(7)R mRNA expression was reduced by the lentivirus-short hairpin RNA knockdown approach. Furthermore, deletion of the GLAST promoter and RNA decay assays showed that P2X(7)R signaling triggered post-transcriptional regulation of GLAST expression via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase cascade. The signaling pathway participating in the P2X(7)R effect on GLAST mRNA expression was identified as a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase-phospholipase Cgamma involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and protein kinase C. We conclude that P2X(7)R activation by sustained release of ATP in the injured CNS may decrease GLAST mRNA stability via Ca(2+)-dependent signaling, suggesting that inhibition of P2X(7)R may allow for recovery of astrocytic GLAST function and protect neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity."

We hypothesized that OEG transplants could attenuate skeletal muscle phenotypic deterioration and that this effect could underlie the functional recovery observed in behavioural tests. A variety of morphological, metabolic and molecular markers were assessed in soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of spinal cord transected (SCT), OEG-transplanted rats 8 months after the intervention and compared with non-transplanted SCT rats and sham-operated (without SCT) controls (C). A multivariate analysis encompassing all the parameters indicated that OEG-transplanted rats displayed skeletal muscle phenotypes intermediate between non-transplanted and sham-operated controls, but different from both. A high correlation was observed between behaviourally tested sensory-motor functional capacity and expression level of slow- and fast-twitch hind limb skeletal muscle phenotypic markers, particularly the histochemical glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (-0.843, P < 0.0001) and the fraction of variant 2s of the slow regulatory myosin light chain isoform (0.848, P < 0.0001) in SOL. Despite the mean overall effect of OEG transplants in patterning skeletal muscle protein expression towards normal, in 6 out of 9 animals they appeared insufficient to overcome fibre type switching and to support a consistent and generalized long-term maintenance of normal skeletal muscle characteristics. The interplay of OEG and exercise-mediated neurotrophic actions is a plausible mechanism underlying OEG transplantation effects on paralysed skeletal muscle."

The SCI was performed by making a unilateral incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-T11 segment under Equithesin anesthesia. The rats were allowed to survive 5 h after trauma. Topical application of BDNF, GDNF, or NGF 30 min after SCI in high concentration (0.5 microg and 1 microg) significantly improved the motor functions and reduced the BSCB breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury seen at 5 h. These beneficial effects of neurotropins were absent when administered separately either 60 or 90 min after SCI.

The antigen specificity of the neuroprotective T cells has not been investigated after FNAx. Here, we compared the neuroprotective capacity of autoimmune and non-autoimmune lymphocytes after FNAx. Prior to axotomy, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) or ovalbumin (a non-self antigen) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). FNAx mice receiving injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) only (unimmunized) or PBS/CFA emulsions served as controls. At 4 weeks after axotomy, bilateral facial motor neuron counts were obtained throughout the facial motor nucleus using unbiased stereology (optical fractionator). The data show that neuroantigen immunizations and 'generic' lymphocyte activation (e.g. PBS/CFA or ovalbumin/CFA immunizations) exacerbated neuron loss above that caused by FNAx alone. We also found that nerve injury potentiated the effector potential of autoimmune lymphocytes. Indeed, prominent forelimb and hindlimb motor deficits were accompanied by disseminated neuroinflammation and demyelination in FNAx mice receiving subencephalitogenic immunization with MOG. FNAx or neuroantigen (MOG or myelin basic protein) immunization alone did not cause these pathological changes. Thus, irrespective of the antigens used to trigger an immune response, neuropathology was enhanced when the immune system was primed in parallel with nerve injury. These data have important implications for therapeutic vaccination in clinical neurotrauma and neurodegeneration."

L1-treated rats showed longer corticospinal tract growth at the injury site. Three rats had BDA-labeled axons that extended beyond the impact center. One L1-Fc-treated rat showed axonal extension and synapse formation in cord distal to the injury. These results indicate that soluble L1-Fc promotes axonal growth and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.

Rats with sham-operation or transection at the thoracic level (T7-T8) received vehicle or 5 mg/kg of the GC dexamethasone (DEX) at 5 min post-lesion and were sacrificed 2 or 4 h after surgery. Another group of SCI rats received vehicle or intensive DEX treatment (5 min, 6 h, 18 h and 46 h post-lesion) and were sacrificed 48 h after surgery. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons or Fos immunoreactive nuclei was studied by computer-assisted image analysis in superficial dorsal horn (Laminae I-III) and central canal area (Lamina X) below the lesion. While constitutive Fos immunoreactive nuclei were sparse in controls, SCI increased Fos expression at 2 and 4 h after injury. DEX treatment significantly enhanced the number of Fos positive nuclei in Laminae I-III by 4 h after transection, although the response was not maintained by intensive steroid treatment when tested at 48 h after SCI. NADPH-d positive neurons in Laminae I-III increased at 2 and 4 h after SCI while a delayed increased was found in central canal area (Lamina X). DEX treatment decreased NADPH-d positive neurons to sham-operated levels at all time points examined. Thus, while GC stimulation of Fos suggests activation of neurons involved in sympathetic outflow and/or pain, down-regulation of NADPH-d indicates attenuation of nociceptive outflow, considering the role of enzyme-derived nitric oxide in pain-related mechanisms. Differential hormonal effects on these molecules agree with their localization in different cell populations."

Hindlimb motor function was assessed as the BBB open field locomotor scores. The BBB scores of three groups treated with either PC-SOD (40,000 units/kg), MP (30 mg/kg), or a combination of PC-SOD and MP (PC-SOD+MP) increased with time until 3 days after SCI, and were significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). Thereafter, the score of the PC-SOD group increased, whereas that of the MP group showed a temporary decrease from day 3 to 5 and then it gradually recovered. The scores in all groups reached a plateau about 18 days after SCI. The PC-SOD+MP group did not show a synergism but a tendency similar to that of the MP group. PC-SOD and MP had down-regulatory effects on mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and inducible-nitric oxide synthetase (i-NOS) after spinal cord compression at 3, 6, and 24 h, respectively, as judged by a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and on the lipid peroxide (LPO) level 1 h after injury as determined by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The suppression of pro-inflammatory genes expression, especially IL-1beta were greater in the MP group than in the PC-SOD group, while suppression of LPO level was similar in these two groups. PC-SOD+MP treatment augmented the suppression of all three pro-inflammatory genes expression and the decrease of the LPO level. The level of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA increased from 6 h after SCI and reached a maximum after 48 h. NT-3 mRNA level was enhanced by PC-SOD treatment, but not by MP treatment. Thus, the effect of MP in suppressing these pro-inflammatory genes expression was more than that of PC-SOD. The difference in motor function in the early and later stage may be partially due to differences in expression of IL-1beta and NT-3 after either treatment, through an IL-1beta-dependent or NT-3-mediated repair response."

Rats (n = 31) were subjected to a weight driven implant injury. MSCs or phosphate buffered saline was injected into the spinal cord 1 week after injury. Sections of tissue were analyzed by double-labeled immunohistochemistry for MSC identification. Functional outcome measurements using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan score were performed weekly to 5 weeks post-injury. The data indicate significant improvement in functional outcome in animals treated with MSC transplantation compared to control animals. Scattered cells derived from MSCs expressed neural protein markers. These data suggest that transplantation of MSCs may have a therapeutic role after spinal cord injury."

To ascertain the occurrence of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the damaged spinal cord, and to investigate the effectiveness of a hydroxyl radical scavenger EPC-K1, a phosphate diester linkage of vitamins E and C, in attenuating the severity of spinal cord injury. Lipid peroxidation has been reported to play an important role in spinal cord injury. There is no report on the use of EPC-K1 to attenuate the severity of spinal cord injury in either animal or human studies. Spinal cord injury was induced by placing a 25-g weight on T12, and the animals were divided into six groups. Group 1 (sham) received only laminectomy. Group 2 (control) received spinal cord injury. Group 3 received EPC-K1 5 minutes before injury. Group 4 received it 5 minutes after injury. Group 5 received it 3 hours after injury. Group 6 received it five times, respectively: at 5 minutes, then 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after injury. The levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were measured in the spinal cord, and the recovery was assessed. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances content increased after injury, with two peaks, at 1 and 4 hours. Concentration at the 4-hour peak was lower in nitrogen mustard-induced leukocytopenia rats than in the control rats. The EPC-K1 injection reduced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances content at 1 and 4 hours after injury in Group 3 (respectively, 34.3% and 42.7% vs. control) and only that at 4 hours in Group 6 (24.9% vs. control). Motor function recovery and histologic findings were better in these two groups than in Group 2. Repeated injection of EPC-K1 attenuated the severity of spinal cord injury."

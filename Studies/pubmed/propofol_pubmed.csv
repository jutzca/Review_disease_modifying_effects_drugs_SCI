An interesting hypothesis is that the general anaesthetic itself might largely contribute to neuroprotection, although in vivo clinical settings hamper studying this possibility directly. To further test neuroprotective effects of a widely used general anaesthetic, we studied if propofol could change the outcome of a rat isolated spinal cord SCI model involving excitotoxicity evoked by 1 h application of kainate with delayed consequences on neurons and locomotor network activity. Propofol (5 μm; 4-8 h) enhanced responses to GABA and depressed those to NMDA together with decrease in polysynaptic reflexes that partly recovered after 1 day washout. Fictive locomotion induced by dorsal root stimuli or NMDA and serotonin was weaker the day after propofol application. Kainate elicited a significant loss of spinal neurons, especially motoneurons, whose number was halved. When propofol was applied for 4-8 h after kainate washout, strong neuroprotection was observed in all spinal areas, including attenuation of motoneuron loss. Although propofol had minimal impact on recovery of electrophysiological characteristics 24 h later, it did not further depress network activity. A significant improvement in disinhibited burst periodicity suggested potential to ameliorate neuronal excitability in analogy to histological data. Functional recovery of locomotor networks perhaps required longer time due to the combined action of excitotoxicity and anaesthetic depression at 24 h. These results suggest propofol could confer good neuroprotection to spinal circuits during experimental SCI."

Devising an efficacious protocol of neuroprotection to arrest excitotoxicity might, therefore, spare a substantial number of neurons and allow later recovery. In vitro preparations of the spinal cord enable detailed measurement of spinal damage evoked by the potent glutamate analogue kainate. Any clinically-relevant neuroprotective treatment should start after the initial lesion and spare networks for at least 24h when cell damage plateaus. Using this strategy, we have observed that the gas anesthetic methoxyflurane provided strong, delayed neuroprotection. It is unclear if this beneficial effect was due to the mechanism of action by methoxyflurane, or it was the consequence of anesthetic depression. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect by propofol (commonly injected i.v. for general anesthesia) after kainate excitotoxicity induced on organotypic spinal slices. At 5μM concentration, propofol significantly attenuated cell death, including neuronal losses and, especially, damage to the highly vulnerable motoneurons. The action by propofol was fully prevented when co-applied with the GABAA antagonist bicuculline, indicating that neuroprotection required intact GABAA receptor function. Although bicuculline per se was not neurotoxic, it largely enhanced the lesional effects of kainate, suggesting that GABAA receptor activity could limit excitotoxicity. Our data might offer an explanation for the beneficial clinical outcome of neurosurgery performed as soon as possible after spinal lesion: we posit that general anesthesia contributes to this outcome, regardless of the type of anesthetic used."

Propofol has been shown to protect against spinal cord injury. Therefore, this study sought to explore the therapeutic effects of their combination on spinal cord injury. Rat models of spinal cord injury were established using the weight drop method. Rats were subjected to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation via tail vein injection and/or propofol injection via tail vein using an infusion pump. Four weeks after cell transplantation and/or propofol treatment, the cavity within the spinal cord was reduced. The numbers of PKH-26-positive cells and horseradish peroxidase-positive nerve fibers apparently increased in the spinal cord. Latencies of somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials in the hindlimb were noticeably shortened, amplitude was increased and hindlimb motor function was obviously improved. Moreover, the combined effects were better than cell transplantation or propofol injection alone. The above data suggest that the combination of propofol injection and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can effectively improve hindlimb electrophysiological function, promote the recovery of motor funtion, and play a neuroprotective role in spinal cord injury in rats."

A 52-year-old man treated with oral dantrolene for spasticity after spinal cord injury was scheduled to undergo irrigation and drainage of a thigh abscess under general anesthesia. He had taken 50 mg oral dantrolene per day for 3 years. Under standard neuromuscular monitoring, anesthesia was performed with propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of ED95 (0.3 mg/kg) of rocuronium could not depress T1 up to 95%. An additional dose of rocuronium depressed T1 completely and decreased the train-of-four (TOF) count to zero. There was no apparent prolongation of the neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium. The TOF ratio was recovered to more than 0.9 within 40 minutes after the last dose of rocuronium. A small dose of oral dantrolene does not prolong the duration of action and recovery of rocuronium."

Muscle relaxants diminish the amplitude of MEP because MEP is the picture of electromyogram. In 5 cases undergoing MEP monitoring, we examined the effect of rocuronium followed by the administration of sugammadex on MEP Anesthesia was induced with propofol (target controlled infusion 3.0-3.5 microg x ml(-1)) and remifentanil 0.15-0.3 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), and the trachea was intubated with the use of rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1) without any muscle rigidity, bucking and laryngospasm. General anesthesia was maintained by total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and remifentanil with no muscle relaxants. Immediately after the tracheal intubation, sugammadex 4 mg x kg(-1) was intravenously given. The amplitude of MEP was measured just before the administration of rocuronium, immediately after the tracheal intubation, and 1, 2, 3, 5 min following the administration of sugammadex. Sugammadex restored the MEP amplitude, deteriorated by rocuronium, in 3 to 5 min to the level of non-paralytic muscles. In one case, it took 8 min to restore the MEP of hemiparetic leg. Taking these findings into consideration, it is likely that rocuronium might not affect the MEP when reversed by sugammadex, and should be safe for smooth tracheal intubation in patients who need MEP monitoring."

However, the neuroprotective effects of xenon on ischemic spinal cord are unknown. The authors compared the effects of xenon and propofol on spinal cord injury following spinal cord ischemia in rabbits. Thirty-two male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to one of three groups. In the xenon and propofol group, 70% of xenon and 0.8 mg/kg/min of propofol were administered 30 min before an aortic occlusion and maintained until the end of the procedure. The aortic occlusion was performed for 15 min. In the sham group, the aorta was not occluded. After an assessment of the hind limb motor function using the Tarlov score (0=paraplegia, 4=normal) at 48 h after reperfusion, gray and white matter injuries were evaluated based on the number of normal neurons in the anterior spinal cord and the percentage areas of vacuolation in the white matter, respectively. In the xenon and propofol groups, the Tarlov score and the number of normal neurons were significantly lower than those in the sham group, whereas the percentage areas of vacuolation were similar among the three groups. There were no significant differences in Tarlov scores and the number of normal neurons between the xenon and the propofol groups. The results indicated that 70% of xenon has no additional neuroprotective effects on ischemic spinal cord injury in rabbits compared with propofol."

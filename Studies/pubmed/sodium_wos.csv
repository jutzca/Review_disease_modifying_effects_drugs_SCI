However, the effect of riluzole on adult spinal cord-derived NSPCs remains unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of riluzole on NSPC survival both in vitro and in vivo. NSPCs harvested from the adult rat spinal cord were exposed to riluzole (1-30 mu M) either alone or in combination with hydrogen peroxide or glutamate in vitro. Measures of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell viability and proliferation were assessed. To examine the effects of riluzole on transplanted NSPCs in vivo, a rodent clip compression model of SCI was used. One week after injury, NSPCs were transplanted into the spinal cord and rats received either riluzole or vehicle treatment for two weeks (similar to the clinically accepted dosing regimen) at which time cords were processed for analysis. Exposure to riluzole (>= 10 mu M) for more than 48 h in vitro reduced NSPC viability. Riluzole treatment (1-10 mu M) did not significantly affect intracellular ROS levels or cell viability in the setting of in vitro oxidative stress. While glutamate (500 mu M) exposure for 96 h significantly increased adult NSPC proliferation and survival, this response was not blocked by concurrent treatment with riluzole (1-10 mu M) thus supporting the notion that the known anti-glutamatergic properties of riluzole are not mediated through direct inhibition of glutamate receptors. Furthermore, riluzole treatment did not impair the survival of transplanted NSPCs in a rodent model of SCI. These results suggest that although NSPCs may have a narrow tolerance to riluzole treatment in vitro, riluzole does not impair NSPC survival at doses that would be used clinically.

The microenvironment after adult SCI is hostile to neural regeneration. Here, we designed a bFGF controlled releasing system (bFGF-CRS) by loading bFGF onto the sodium hyaluronate collagen scaffolds to modify the hostile microenvironment. We found that the bFGF-CRS scaffolds had proper mechanical properties for spinal cord regeneration and could slowly release bFGF for up to 6 weeks under the physiological condition. After implantation, the bFGF-CRS scaffolds could reduce microglial activation, promote revascularization, elicit endogenous neurogenesis and promote regrowth of transected axons. The endogenous mature newly born neurons could form synaptic-like connections with each other or with host neurons, including cortex neurons, brainstem neurons and spinal interneurons. The functional nascent neural networks between the lesion area and the host spinal cord were established. It eventually led to hindlimb locomotion recovery. Our study suggests that the bFGF-CRS scaffolds, modifying the microenvironment of the lesion area, can rebuild the damaged neural circuit, thus support great potential for SCI treatment in the clinical application."

Riluzole, a sodium channel blocker used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been initially trialed in human SCI. We performed a systematic review to critically assess the efficacy of riluzole in locomotor recovery and damage extension in SCI rat models, and the potential for clinical translation. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases were searched from their inception date to March 2018. Two reviewers independently selected animal studies that evaluated neurological recovery and lesion area following riluzole treatment in SCI rat models, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Pairwise meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and network meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of riluzole on SCI. Ten eligible studies were included. Two studies had high methodological quality. Overall, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in riluzole-treated animals versus controls, and effect sizes showed a gradual increase from the 1st (five studies, n = 104, mean difference = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.11 to 2.37, p = 0.03) to 6th week after treatment (five studies, n = 120, mean difference = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.42, p < 0.0001). Riluzole was associated with improved outcomes in the inclined plane test and the tissue preservation area. Subgroup analyses suggested an association of locomotor recovery with riluzole dose. Network meta-analysis showed that 5 mg/kg riluzole exhibited greater protection than 2.5 and 8 mg/kg riluzole. Collectively, this review suggests that riluzole has a protective effect on SCI, with good safety and a clear mechanism of action and may be suitable for future clinical trials or applications. However, animal results should be interpreted with caution given the known limitations in animal experimental design and methodological quality."

Axons spared from the initial injury may later undergo secondary axonal degeneration. Lack of growth cone formation, regeneration, and loss of additional myelinated axonal projections within the spinal cord greatly limits neurological recovery following injury. To assess how central myelinated axons of the spinal cord respond to injury, we developed an ex vivo living spinal cord model utilizing transgenic mice that express yellow fluorescent protein in axons and a focal and highly reproducible laser-induced spinal cord injury to document the fate of axons and myelin (lipophilic fluorescent dye Nile Red) over time using two-photon excitation time-lapse microscopy. Dynamic processes such as acute axonal injury, axonal retraction, and myelin degeneration are best studied in real-time. However, the non-focal nature of contusion-based injuries and movement artifacts encountered during in vivo spinal cord imaging make differentiating primary and secondary axonal injury responses using high resolution microscopy challenging. The ex vivo spinal cord model described here mimics several aspects of clinically relevant contusion/compression-induced axonal pathologies including axonal swelling, spheroid formation, axonal transection, and peri-axonal swelling providing a useful model to study these dynamic processes in real-time. Major advantages of this model are excellent spatiotemporal resolution that allows differentiation between the primary insult that directly injures axons and secondary injury mechanisms; controlled infusion of reagents directly to the perfusate bathing the cord; precise alterations of the environmental milieu (e.g., calcium, sodium ions, known contributors to axonal injury, but near impossible to manipulate in vivo); and murine models also offer an advantage as they provide an opportunity to visualize and manipulate genetically identified cell populations and subcellular structures. Here, we describe how to isolate and image the living spinal cord from mice to capture dynamics of acute axonal injury."

Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (CSSEPs) were recorded as an indicator of spinal cord function before and after a severe compression injury. Vital signs and the CSSEPs were monitored up to five hours post-injury. U-4389F treatment was given as a single injection (15 mg kg(-1)) one hour prior to the injury which was followed by a continuous infusion (3 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) during the procedure. The CSSEPs were abolished immediately after this injury both, in the untreated and treated animal groups. The majority of the treated animals (80%) demonstrated recovery of the CSSEPs within the second hour post-injury. The control group showed 40% recovery at this time period.

These include the synthetic glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP), and the new 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, U74006F. Treatment of spinal cord-injured cats with high doses of MP promoted or spared locomotor function and preserved spinal cord tissue. Extending these findings in cats to humans, it was recently demonstrated that high doses of MP administered within 8 h of injury significantly improved neurologic recovery in human spinal cord-injured patients. The compound U74006F is one of a series of 21-aminosteroids that, unlike MP, lack glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid or other hormonal activity yet are potent inhibitors of lipid perioxidation. Over a 100-fold range of doses, U74006F promoted recovery of locomotor function in spinal cord-injured cats. The lowest effective dose for U74006F was 100 times lower than the maximally effective dose for MP. The efficacy of U74006F is unchanged if treatment is initiated within 4 h of injury. However, if treatment is delayed for 8 h, the therapeutic potency of U74006F is substantially reduced. These findings suggest that antioxidant therapy can successfully limit the effects of both experimental and clinical spinal cord injury especially if the treatment is initiated shortly after injury."

It is associated with a variety of injurious conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for spinal cord injury (SCI). Sivelestat sodium (SIV), a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor initially used to treat acute lung injury, has been known to protect against compression-induced and ischemic SCI. However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25 mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) signaling in the spinal cord. The behavioral tests showed that SIV promoted functional recovery after traumatic SCI as reflected in the sustained increase in the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores throughout the observation period. In conclusion, our results reveal GAPDH/Siah1 as a novel signaling pathway during the progression of SCI, which can be blocked by SIV. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

To identify patients with acute SCI and the use of high dose methylprednisolone, International Classification of Disease revision codes, medical behavior codes and examination codes were used. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they received methylprednisolone therapy (MP group vs non-MP group). Results The average age-adjusted incidence of acute SCI per 1,000,000 persons was 26.4 and the peak incidence was in the 50s overall. The methylprednisolone prescription rate was highest in 2012 (76%) and continued to decrease thereafter, being lowest in 2017 (41%). The MP group showed higher complication rates in terms of pneumonia (OR 1.8, 95% CI, 1.62-2.0), GI bleeding (OR 1.2, 95% CI, 1.05-1.38), and UTI (OR 1.68, 95% CI, 1.53-1.84).

Its initial. amplitude is a significant indicator of the severity of spinal cord injury, and many cations, such as sodium and calcium, account for the major portion of injury potentials. This injury potential, as well as injury current, can be modulated by direct current field stimulation; however, the appropriate parameters of the electrical field are hard to define. In this paper, injury potential is used as a parameter to adjust the intensity of electrical stimulation. Injury potential could be modulated to slightly above 0 mV (as the anode-centered group) by placing the anodes at the site of the injured spinal cord and the cathodes at the rostral and caudal sections, or around -70 mV, which is resting membrane potential (as the cathode-centered group) by reversing the polarity of electrodes in the anode-centered group. In addition, rats receiving no electrical stimulation were used as the control group. Results showed that the absolute value of the injury potentials acquired after 30 minutes of electrical stimulation was higher than the control group rats and much lower than the initial absolute value, whether the anodes or the cathodes were placed at the site of injury. This phenomenon illustrates that by changing the polarity of the electrical field, electrical stimulation can effectively modulate the injury potentials in rats after spinal cord injury. This is also beneficial for the spontaneous repair of the cell membrane and the reduction of cation influx."

We tested the hypothesis that elevated extracellular concentrations of NO introduced by the donor Spermine NONOate, induce reversible axonal conduction deficits in neurons of the guinea pig spinal cord. The compound action potential (CAP) and compound membrane potential (CMP) of excised ventral cord white matter were recorded before, during, and after bathing the tissue (30 min) in varying concentrations (0.25-3.0 mM) of Spermine NONOate. The principal results were a rapid onset, dose-dependent, reduction in amplitude of the CAP (p < 0.05) accompanied by depolarization of the CMP during NO exposure. These effects were largely reversible on washout, at low concentration of the donor (0.5 mM), but were only partially reversed at higher concentrations. Changes in the electrophysiological properties were not evident when the donor had been a priori depleted of NO. The results extend previous reports that NO induces reversible axonal conduction deficits. They provide new evidence of dissociation of the effects of NO on CAP and CMP during washout, and after prolonged exposure to the donor. They add support to the emerging concept that immune-mediated axonal conduction failure contributes to reversible neurologic deficits following neurotrauma and aid in understanding clinical phenomena such as spinal shock and neurologic recovery."

Although several techniques have been described to assess SCBF, they all have significant limitations. To overcome the latter, we propose the use of real-time contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEU). Here we describe the application of this technique in a rat contusion model of SCI. A jugular catheter is first implanted for the repeated injection of contrast agent, a sodium chloride solution of sulphur hexafluoride encapsulated microbubbles. The spine is then stabilized with a custom-made 3D-frame and the spinal cord dura mater is exposed by a laminectomy at ThIX-ThXII. The ultrasound probe is then positioned at the posterior aspect of the dura mater (coated with ultrasound gel). To assess baseline SCBF, a single intravenous injection (400 mu l) of contrast agent is applied to record its passage through the intact spinal cord microvasculature. A weight-drop device is subsequently used to generate a reproducible experimental contusion model of SCI. Contrast agent is re-injected 15 min following the injury to assess post-SCI SCBF changes. CEU allows for real time and in-vivo assessment of SCBF changes following SCI. In the uninjured animal, ultrasound imaging showed uneven blood flow along the intact spinal cord. Furthermore, 15 min post-SCI, there was critical ischemia at the level of the epicenter while SCBF remained preserved in the more remote intact areas. In the regions adjacent to the epicenter (both rostral and caudal), SCBF was significantly reduced. This corresponds to the previously described ""ischemic penumbra zone"". This tool is of major interest for assessing the effects of therapies aimed at limiting ischemia and the resulting tissue necrosis subsequent to SCI."

Furthermore, in addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, it appears to have a beneficial action on voiding, once this drug acts on the external urethral sphincter relaxation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dantrolene on urinary bladder injury that follows experimental SCI. Forty-six male Wistar rats were laminectomized at T13, and a compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. After euthanasia, the urinary bladder was removed for gross and histological evaluation. Traumatized animals showed urinary retention with severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Injured animals treated with dantrolene had less bladder hemorrhage and inflammatory infiltrate than those treated with placebo (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that dantrolene may protect against urinary bladder lesions that follow SCI. Treating spinal cord-injured patients with this agent may be a promising additional therapeutic strategy to alleviate the accompanying inflammatory process. The results of the current study show that dantrolene has protective effects on spinal cord contusion-induced urinary bladder injury.

SCI was induced by extradural compression for 1min of the spinal cord at the T6-7 level using an aneurysm clip, and SB (10-30-100mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1 and 6h after SCI. For locomotor activity, study mice were treated with SB once daily for 10days. Morphological examination was performed by light microscopy through hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. In addition, NF-B, IB-, COX-2, and iNOS expressions were assayed by western blot analysis and IL-1 and TNF- levels by immunohistochemistry analysis. The results showed that SB treatment significantly ameliorated histopathology changes and improved recovery of motor function changes in spinal cord injury in a dose-dependent manner.

First published September 7, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00295.2011.-Spinal cord injury (SCI) has serious long-term consequences on sympathetic cardiovascular regulation. Orthostatic intolerance results from insufficient baroreflex regulation (BR) of sympathetic outflow to maintain proper blood pressure upon postural changes. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs due to insufficient inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity. Both of these conditions result from the inability to control sympathetic activity caudal to SCI. It is well established that limited motor ability recovers after incomplete SCI. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether recovery of BR occurs after chronic, left thoracic spinal cord hemisection at either T(3) or T(8). Baroreflex tests were performed in rats by measuring the reflex response of left (ipsilateral) renal sympathetic nerve activity to decreases and increases in arterial pressure produced by ramped infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. One week after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was modestly impaired. However, 8 wk after a T(3) left hemisection, BR function was normal. One week after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly impaired, and 8 wk after a T(8) left hemisection, BR function was significantly improved. These results indicate that BR of renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats may partially recover after spinal cord hemisections, becoming normal by 8 wk after a T(3) lesion, but not after a T(8) lesion. The nature of the spinal cord and/or brain stem reorganization that mediates this recovery remains to be determined."

The grafting of NPCs, however, is limited by its lower viability and undesired glial differentiation. Understanding the mechanism underlying these events, therefore, is essential for the potential future use of NPCs. In the present study, we investigated the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition on survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration of the rat NPCs. We observed that NPCs derived from the E14.5 rat brain constitutively expressed both class I and class II HDAC mRNA Inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin A (TSA) blocked the proliferation, increased neuronal differentiation and decreased astrocyte differentiation of the NPCs. Meanwhile, TSA had no significant effects on survival and migration of the NPCs.

Swimming tests were performed 3 to 6 weeks after SCI induction. We placed the SCI rats into spasticity-strong or spasticity-weak groups based on the frequency of spastic behavior during the swimming test. Subsequently, we recorded the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) and examined the immunoreactivity of serotonin (5HT) and its receptor (5-HT2A) in the spinal tissues of the SCI rats. The spasticity-strong group had significantly decreased rate-dependent depression of the H-reflex compared to the spasticity-weak group. The area of 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the spasticity-strong group. Thus, both electrophysiological and histological evaluations indicate that the spasticity-strong group presented with a more severe upper motor neuron syndrome. We also observed the groups in their cages for 20 hours. Our results suggest that the swimming test provides an accurate evaluation of spasticity in this contusive SCI model.

We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase is one of the key determinants of vascular endothelium disruption/destabilization and affects angiopoietins expression after spinal cord injury. To test this, tubule formation and angiopoietins expression were assessed in endothelial cells exposed to different concentrations of recombinant neutropil elastase. Then, the expression of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and neutrophil elastase was determined at 3 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in a clinically relevant model of moderate compression (35 g for 5 min at T10) spinal cord injury. A dichotomy between the levels of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 was observed; thus, we utilized a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (sivelestat sodium; 30 mg/kg, i. p., b. i. d.) after spinal cord injury. The expression levels of neutropil elastase and angiopoietin-2 increased, and that of angiopoietin1 decreased after spinal cord injury in rats. The sivelestat regimen, optimized via a pharmacokinetics study, had potent effects on vascular stabilization by upregulating angiopoietin-1 via the AKT pathway and preventing tight junction protein degradation. Moreover, sivelestat attenuated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after spinal cord injury and hence subsequently alleviated secondary damage observed as a reduction in glial scar formation and the promotion of blood vessel formation and stabilization. As a result, hindlimb locomotor function significantly recovered in the sivelestat-treated animals as determined by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and footprint analyses. Furthermore, sivelestat treatment attenuated neuropathic pain as assessed by responses to von Frey filaments after spinal cord injury. Thus, our result suggests that inhibiting neutropil elastase by administration of sivelestat is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit glial scar and promote functional recovery by upregulating angiopoietin-1 after spinal cord injury."

In vitro results indicate that GB may influence microglial phagocytosis and therefore this action may be at the basis of the results obtained in vivo."

Currently, there are no approved treatments and very few therapeutic targets are under investigation. Here, we combined 4 high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, 7 days and 8 weeks following clinically-relevant rat SCI to identify proteins with persistent differential expression post-injury. Out of thousands of differentially regulated entities our combined analysis identified 40 significantly upregulated versus 48 significantly downregulated molecules, which were persistently altered at the mRNA and protein level, 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI. Bioinformatics analysis was then utilized to identify currently available drugs with activity against the filtered molecules and to isolate proteins with known or unknown function in SCI. Our findings revealed multiple overlooked therapeutic candidates with important bioactivity and established druggability but with unknown expression and function in SCI including the upregulated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), cathepsins A, H, Z (CTSA, CTSH, CTSZ) and proteasome protease PSMB10, as well as the downregulated ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), malic enzyme (ME1) and sodium-potassium ATPase (ATP1A3), amongst others. This work reveals previously unappreciated therapeutic candidates for SCI and available drugs, thus providing a valuable resource for further studies and potential repurposing of existing therapeutics for SCI."

After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with a vascular clip, PBA was immediately administered into injured rat via intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg) and then further treated once a day for 2 weeks for behavior test. Spinal cord was collected at 1 day post-injury for evaluation of the effects of ER stress and PBA on BSCB disruption after SCI. PBA significantly attenuated BSCB permeability and degradation of tight junction molecules such as P120, beta-catenin, Occludin and Claudin5 at 1 day after injury and improved functional recovery in the rat model of trauma. The BSCB protective effect of PBA is related to the inhibition of ER stress induced by SCI. In addition, PBA significantly inhibited the increase of ER stress markers and prevents loss of tight junction and adherens junction proteins in TG-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Taken together, our data demonstrate that therapeutic strategies targeting ER stress may be suitable for the therapy of preserving BSCB integrity after SCI.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of EA treatment in an animal model of SCI using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score method, lesion volume by cresyl violet staining and neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Our results showed that EA therapy improved functional recovery, and reduced tissue loss and neuronal apoptosis after SCI. Meanwhile, we found that proapoptotic proteins (cleaved-caspase-3, 9 and cleaved-PARP) were downregulated and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was upregulated following EA. To further explore the antiapoptotic effect of EA treatment, we verified that a large set of microRNAs (miRNAs) expression were altered following EA treatment and the miR-214 was one of the miRNAs being most significantly upregulated. Importantly, we validated both apoptosis related protein Bax and pain related protein Nav1.3 as two functional targets of miR-214 in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, our data showed that EA attenuates SCI-induced Nav1.3 and Bax upregulation in injured spinal cord via upregulating miR-214. These results suggest that miR-214 played an important role after SCI in the process of EA therapy, and the miR-214 could become an attractive novel therapeutic target for the treatment of SCI.

The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site.

However, direct evidence that VGSCs are involved in microglial activation after injury has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we show that the increase in VGSC inward current elicited microglial activation followed inflammatory responses, leading to cell death after injury in vitro and in vivo. Isoforms of sodium channel, Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.2, and Na(v)1.6 were expressed in primary microglia, and the inward current of VGSC was increased by LPS treatment, which was blocked by a sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX). TTX inhibited LPS-induced NF-B activation, expression of TNF-, IL-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NO production. LPS-induced p38MAPK activation followed pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) production was inhibited by TTX, whereas LPS-induced JNK activation was not. TTX also inhibited caspase-3 activation and cell death of primary cortical neurons in neuron/microglia co-cultures by inhibiting LPS-induced microglia activation. Furthermore, TTX attenuated caspase-3 activation and oligodendrocyte cell death at 5 d after SCI by inhibiting microglia activation and p38MAPK activation followed proNGF production, which is known to mediate oligodendrocyte cell death.

The BSCB is primarily formed of endothelial cell, which forms a specialized tight seal due to the presence of TJs. BSCB disruption after SCI allows neutrophil infiltration. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 is believed to be mainly expressed by neutrophils and is quickly released upon neutrophil activation. Here, we determined whether MMP-8 is involved in the TJ protein degradation in endothelial cells and also determined its role in the neuroinflammation after SCI. MMP-8 recombinant protein treatment increases the TNF-alpha expression and decreased the TJ (occludin and zonula occludens-1) protein expression in the endothelial cells. Likewise, specific MMP-8 inhibitor (MMP-8I) significantly prevented the TNF-alpha-induced decrease in the expression of TJ protein in endothelial cells. Furthermore, MMP-8 expression was significantly increased 1 and 3 days after moderate compression (35 g for 5 min at T10 level) SCI, whereas TJ protein levels decreased as determined qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. MMP-8 was inhibited directly using a MMP-8I (5 mg/kg) and indirectly by reducing neutrophil infiltration with sivelestat sodium (50 mg/kg) or using the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (100 mg/kg). The MMP-8I significantly decreased TNF-alpha expression, IL-6, and iNOS expression and increased TJ protein expression after SCI. In addition, MMP-8I significantly lessens the amount of Evans blue dye extravasation observed after injury. Thus, our result suggests that MMP-8 plays an imperative role in inflammation and degradation of TJ proteins. Increased MMP-8 expression was associated with the early inflammatory phase of SCI. Inhibiting MMP-8 significantly attenuated SCI-induced inflammation, BSCB breakdown, and cell injury."

First published March 23, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00570.2010.-The objectives of this study were to probe the contribution of spinal neuron persistent sodium conductances to reflex hyperexcitability in human chronic spinal cord injury. The intrinsic excitability of spinal neurons provides a novel target for medical intervention. Studies in animal models have shown that persistent inward currents, such as persistent sodium currents, profoundly influence neuronal excitability, and recovery of persistent inward currents in spinal neurons of animals with spinal cord injury routinely coincides with the appearance of spastic reflexes. Pharmacologically, this neuronal excitability can be decreased by agents that reduce persistent inward currents, such as the selective persistent sodium current inhibitor riluzole. We were able to recruit seven subjects with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury who were not concurrently taking antispasticity medications into the study. Reflex responses (flexion withdrawal and H-reflexes) and volitional strength (isometric maximum voluntary contractions) were tested at the ankle before and after placebo-controlled, double-blinded oral administration of riluzole (50 mg). Riluzole significantly decreased the peak ankle dorsiflexion torque component of the flexion withdrawal reflex. Peak maximum voluntary torque in both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion directions was not significantly changed. Average dorsiflexion torque sustained during the 5-s isometric maximum voluntary contraction, however, increased significantly. There was no effect, however, on the monosynaptic plantar and dorsiflexor H-reflex responses. Overall, these results demonstrate a contribution of persistent sodium conductances to polysynaptic reflex excitability in human chronic spinal cord injury without a significant role in maximum strength production. These results suggest that intrinsic spinal cellular excitability could be a target for managing chronic spinal cord injury hyperreflexia impairments without causing a significant loss in volitional strength."

Many drugs have been investigated experimentally to assess their potential to preserve injured tissue and promote functional recovery in clinically relevant settings, and several of them would be suitable for assessment in future veterinary clinical trials. In addition, experimental techniques designed to mould the response of the CNS to injury, by the promotion of axonal regeneration across the lesion and the encouragement of local sprouting of undamaged axons, have recently been successful, suggesting that effective therapy for even very severe spinal cord injury may soon be available."

A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). Indeed, the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP) has been shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, and to improve neurological recovery in spinal cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U.S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI, since it was already on the U.S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy has been obtained. This article explains the process of the discovery, development, and Food and Drug Administration regulation of new drugs for SCI; reviews the past development of MP and tirilazad for acute SCI; identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development; and suggests some promising therapeutic approaches that could either replace or be added to high-dose MP."

For the first time, similar methodology also has been applied to study the effects of hypothermia. Canine spinal cords were injured at T13 by use of an epidural balloon and then were treated with local hypothermia or intramuscular dexamethasone or both. Motor recovery was assessed using a modified Tarlov scale. At either 6 days or 7 weeks, spinal cords T8 through L4 were removed and divided into 10 ordered blocks, which were analyzed for wet and dry weight, potassium concentration, and sodium concentration. Correlations between clinical motor and chemical results were evaluated. The conclusions drawn are as follows: 1) The canine severe rapid compressive injury model, unlike the previously published less severe feline impact injury model, is not associated with widespread early loss of spinal cord tissue potassium content (dry weight). 2) The dog compressive model, unlike the cat impact model, does not provide evidence that one fundamental mechanism of the confirmed beneficial action of steroids entails enhanced early preservation of tissue potassium content. 3) At 6 days, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and increase in sodium concentration, representing edema, occurred at and adjacent to the direct compression site in all lesioned dog groups except those treated with dexamethasone, demonstrating an antiedema effect of dexamethasone that was nullified by concurrent local hypothermia. 4) This antiedema effect of dexamethasone was associated with superior early motor improvement but did not lead to superior long-term function, in comparison with hypothermia. 5) At 7 weeks, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and potassium concentration, and increase in sodium concentration, all restricted to the directly compressed segment, signify necrosis. 6) This new chemical index of necrosis was highly correlated with clinical motor performance."

Up-regulation of immune function with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 mu g i.p.) induces a recovery of normal sodium taste responses, suggesting that the sodium-deficient diet is immunosuppressive. In fact, there is a bilateral increase in the number of lingual, activated macrophages in control-fed rats receiving CT nerve section that does not occur in sodium-deficient rats after sectioning. In the current study, we hypothesized that the LPS-induced recovery of normal taste function in sodium-deficient rats is based on an increase in the activated macrophage response to denervation. Rats receiving a unilateral CT nerve section, a sodium-restricted diet, and/or an injection of LPS (100 mu g; i.p.) were overdosed with pentobarbital at day 2 postsectioning, and tongues were rapidly dissected and frozen. Cryosections were then immunohistochemically stained to determine the percentage of ED1 staining for activated macrophages or the number of alpha beta or gamma delta T cells. Activated macrophage levels were significantly increased in sodium-restricted rats that received LPS following unilateral CT nerve section, supporting our hypothesis. These novel findings suggest that LPS overcomes the immunosuppression induced by the sodium-restricted diet and also indicate that the immune system plays a role in regulating taste function after neural injury.

Spinal transections were performed under isoflurane anesthesia 1-8 weeks prior to the terminal experiment. Four major differences between intact and transected rats were observed: 1) While the frequency of micturition events in the intact rat was dependent upon the rate of bladder filling, the bladder contraction and associated EUS activation in transected rats exhibited an intrinsic rhythm that was independent of the rate of bladder filling and post-transection survival time. 2) EUS activation was augmented at the beginning of active bladder contraction in the transected rat, indicating an amplified guarding reflex. 3) Phasic EUS activity at the peak of bladder contraction (EUS bursting) in the intact rat was markedly reduced or absent in the transected rat. 4) The sustained tonic EUS activity following bladder relaxation in the intact rat was absent in the transected rat.

Although the mechanism of action is not completely clear, experimental data point to protection against membrane peroxidation and edema reduction. The melanocortin melanotropin is known to improve axonal regeneration following sciatic nerve injury, and to stimulate corticospinal outgrowth after partial spinal cord transection. Recently, we showed that intrathecally administered alpha MSH had beneficial effects on functional recovery after experimental SCI. Since both drugs have shown their value in intervention studies after (experimental) spinal cord injury (ESCI), we decided to study the effects of combined treatment. Our results again showed that alpha MSH enhances functional recovery after ESCI in the rat and that MP, although not affecting functional recovery adversely by itself, abolished the effects observed with alpha MSH when combined.

Measurements of interstitial ion activity in the grey matter at the injury site (with ion-selective electrodes), showed a decrease of sodium and calcium, an increase of potassium, a small acidification and a negative shift in the electrical potential 5 min after injury. The interstitial ionic changes were completely reversible within 90 min following injury. Measurements of the ion content in a tissue sample from the injury site (flame photometry) showed an increase of sodium and calcium and a decrease of potassium 5 min after injury. The magnitude of the post-injury sodium change was much larger than the potassium change, both for interstitial and tissue measurements. Treatment of the animals with the calcium entry blocker flunarizine before the injury did not influence the magnitude of post-injury interstitial calcium decrease but significantly increased the rate of subsequent recovery. Pre-injury flunarizine treatment also significantly increased the recovery rate of the electrical potential. The experiments suggest the occurrence of a net ionic shift towards the intracellular space, which may contribute to oedema formation in the very early post-injury period. The post-injury decrease of interstitial calcium activity is probably not mediated by flunarizine-sensitive calcium entry mechanisms; such mechanisms may, however, be involved in the subsequent recovery period for interstitial calcium activity. Calcium ions may be involved in the recovery process of the negative electrical potential after injury."

We found an example of such recovery in the central pattern generator (CPG) for the escape swim of the mollusc Tritonia diomedea. The CPG neurons are bilaterally represented and each neuron projects an axon through one of two pedal commissures. Cutting the posterior pedal commissure [pedal nerve 6 (PdN6)] in the animal or in the isolated brain caused a deficit in the swim behavior and in the fictive motor pattern, respectively, each of which recovered over the course of 20 h. Locally blocking spiking activity in PdN6 with sodium-free saline and/or tetrodotoxin disrupted the motor pattern in a reversible manner. Maintained blockade of PdN6 led to a functional recovery of the swim motor pattern similar to that observed in response to cutting the commissure. Among the CPG neurons, cerebral neuron 2 (C2) makes functional connection onto the ventral swim interneuron-B (VSI) in both pedal ganglia. Cutting or blocking PdN6 eliminated C2-evoked excitation of VSI in the pedal ganglion distal to the lesion. Associated with the recovery of the swim motor pattern, the synaptic action of C2 onto VSI in the proximal pedal ganglion changed from being predominantly inhibitory to being predominantly excitatory. These results show that the Tritonia swim CPG undergoes adaptive plasticity in response to the loss of critical synaptic connections; reversal of synaptic action in the CPG may be at least partially responsible for this functional recovery."

A prior peripheral nerve conditioning lesion is a well-established means of increasing the intrinsic growth state of sensory neurons whose axons project within the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Combining such a prior peripheral nerve conditioning lesion with the infusion of antibodies that neutralize the growth inhibitory effects of the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan promotes sensory axon growth through the glial sear and into the white matter of the dorsal columns. The physiological properties of these regenerated axons, particularly in the chronic SCI phase, have not been established. Here we examined the functional status of regenerated sensory afferents in the dorsal columns after SCI Six months post-injury, we located and electrically mapped functional sensory axons that had regenerated beyond the injury site. The regenerated axons had reduced conduction velocity, decreased frequency-following ability, and increasing latency to repetitive stimuli. Many of the axons that had regenerated into the dorsal columns rostral to the injury site were chronically demyelinated. These results demonstrate that regenerated sensory axons remain in a chronic pathophysiological state and emphasize the need to restore normal conduction properties to regenerated axons after spinal cord injury.

First published December 22, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00810.2010.-Previously, we reported a pronounced reduction in transmission through surviving axons contralateral to chronic hemisection (HX) of adult rat spinal cord. To examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this diminished transmission, we recorded intracellularly from lumbar lateral white matter axons in deeply anesthetized adult rats in vivo and measured the propagation of action potentials (APs) through rubrospinal/reticulospinal tract (RST/RtST) axons contralateral to chronic HX at T10. We found decreased excitability in these axons, manifested by an increased rheobase to trigger APs and longer latency for AP propagation passing the injury level, without significant differences in axonal resting membrane potential and input resistance. These electrophysiological changes were associated with altered spatial localization of Nav1.6 sodium channels along axons: a subset of axons contralateral to the injury exhibited a diffuse localization (> 10 mu m spread) of Nav1.6 channels, a pattern characteristic of demyelinated axons (Craner MJ, Newcombe J, Black JA, Hartle C, Cuzner ML, Waxman SG. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101: 8168-8173, 2004b). This result was substantiated by ultrastructural changes seen with electron microscopy, in which an increased number of large-caliber, demyelinated RST axons were found contralateral to the chronic HX. Therefore, an increased rheobase, pathological changes in the distribution of Nav1.6 sodium channels, and the demyelination of contralateral RST axons are likely responsible for their decreased conduction chronically after HX and thus may provide novel targets for strategies to improve function following incomplete spinal cord injury."

Here, using a model of lower cervical hemicord contusion, we compared safety and efficacy for the three treatments, administered beginning 4h after trauma.

On open-field locomotor scores (modified Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores), hypothermia- and glibenclamide-treated animals were largely indistinguishable throughout the study, whereas riluzole-treated rats underperformed for the first two weeks; during the last four weeks, scores for the three treatments were similar, and significantly different from controls. On beam balance, hypothermia and glibenclamide treatments showed significant advantages over riluzole. After trauma, rats in the glibenclamide group rapidly regained a normal pattern of weight gain that differed markedly and significantly from that in all other groups.

This study examines the effects of agents purported to improve recovery following spinal cord trauma, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, dextromethorphan, and the combination of both, on the post-traumatic alterations of membrane lipid metabolism. Methods. After sparing ten rats for a control group (G1) and performing T3-T6 laminectomies in 150 rats, spinal cord injuries were accomplished in 120 of 150 Wistar rats with an aneurysmal clip compression at the level of T4-5 for 30 sec. Hence the G2 group (n 30) included the ""only laminectomy/sham"" group. The 120 injured animals were subdivided into four equal groups (n 30 each). Group G3 underwent no therapy, G4 methylprednisolone (MP), G5 dextromethorphan (DM), and G6 MP+DM therapies. Groups G2-G6 were killed ten by ten at 10 min, 30 min, and 120 min after the operation. We measured tissue (MDA) and blood malonyldialdehyde (MDAb), (a product of lipid peroxidation) levels as an indicator of oxidative damage by thiobarbituric acid method and activity levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes. Inter-group and intragroup results were compared statistically. Results. Methylprednisolone was able to keep the levels for all parameters close to baseline except for 30-min MDA, MDAb, and SOD values. But their results were all different from those of G3. Dextromethorphan was successful in this respect at 30-min GSH-Px and 120-min SOD and GSH-Px, and all values were also different from G3 values except for 10-min MDA, SOD, and GSH-Px. Combined therapy was not able to keep levels close to baseline for all parameters, but they were different from G3's except for the GSH-Px values. Methylprednisolone values displayed minimal alterations according to baseline at 120 min. Dextromethorphan was relatively unsuccessful at 10 min. Combined therapy did not show benefit superior to MP/DM single therapies."

Sodium aescinate (1.0 mg/kg body weight) or equivalent volume of saline was administered 30 min after injury by intravenous injection, with an additional dose daily for seven consecutive days after moderate SCI in rats. After contusion injury of the 8th thoracic (T8) spinal cord, aescin-treated rats developed less severe hind limb weakness than saline controls, as assayed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, the beam walking test, and a footprint analysis. The improved locomotor outcomes in aescin-treated rats corresponded to markedly decreased immune response, oxidative stress, neuronal loss, axon demyelination, spinal cord swelling, and cell apoptosis, measured around T8 after impact. Our data suggest aescin treatment as a novel, early, neuroprotective approach in SCI. Given the known safety of aescin in clinical applications, the results of this study suggest that it is a good candidate for SCI treatment in humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The rationale for this regimen has been based upon the need for high doses (i.e., 30 mg/kg initial IV dose) to inhibit posttraumatic lipid peroxidation (LP) in the injured spinal segment. However, injury also triggers the immediate calcium-mediated activation of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), the release of arachidonic acid, and the enzymatic formation of potentially deleterious prostaglandins (PGF(2 alpha), PGE(2)), thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and leukotrienes (LTs). Thus, in view of the glucocorticold receptor-mediated inhibition of PLA(2) that underlies much of MP's antiinflammatory actions, an additional neuroprotective mechanism may relate to an inhibition of eicosanoid formation. Using the cat spinal cord compression model (180g x 5 min at L3; Na pentobarbitol anesthesia), we examined whether 30 min postinjury dosing with MP (30 mg/kg IV) could attenuate spinal tissue eicosanoid levels measured by enzyme immunoassay at 1h(Experiment 1). Pial blood flow was measured over the dorsal columns at the injury site using laser doppler flowmetry to monitor posttraumatic hyperperfusion as an index of the microvascular pathophysiology of acute SCI. In vehicle treated animals at 1 h postinjury, there was a significant increase in the tissue levels of PGF(2 alpha) (+290%), PGE(2) (+260%), TXB(2) (stable analog of TXA(2), +126%), and LTB(4) (+73%) in comparison to sham, uninjured animals. However, 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha), (stable analog of prostacyclin or PGI(2)) and LTC(4) did not increase. Methylprednisolone did not reduce the increase in eicosanoid production. Tn the case of LTB(4) and LTC(4), MP actually increased the levels further. In addition, we examined the effects of a double dose MP regimen (30 mg/kg IV at 30 min plus 15 mg/kg IV at 2.5 h postinjury) on spinal cord eicosanoid levels at 4 h postinjury (Experiment 2). At 4 h postinjury, significant increases in PGF(2 alpha), PGE(2), TXB(2), and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) were observed, and with the exception of PGE(2), no MP attenuation of the increased eicosanoids was seen. These results fail to provide evidence that postinjury administration of high dose MP exerts a significant anti-PLA(2) action. On the other hand, MP effectively inhibited secondary spinal cord pial hyperperfusion, which is believed to be largely mediated by free radical-lipid peroxidative mechanisms. Thus, it seems likely that the protective action of MP on the acute microvascular pathophysiology of SCI is mediated by its well-documented effects on posttraumatic LP. In support of this conclusion, parallel experiments were carried out that demonstrated that 30 min postinjury treatment with the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid LP inhibitor tirilazad mesylate, which completely lacks any PLA(2)-inhibitory action, also eliminated posttraumatic pial hyperperfusion without any effect on the increase in spinal cord eicosanoids at either 1 or 4 h postinjury."

A central mechanism in spasticity is hyperexcitability of the spinal stretch reflex, which presents symptomatically as a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes and exaggerated tendon jerks. In this study we tested the hypothesis that dendritic spine remodeling within motor reflex pathways in the spinal cord contributes to H-reflex dysfunction indicative of spasticity after contusion SCI. Six weeks after SCI in adult Sprague-Dawley rats, we observed changes in dendritic spine morphology on alpha-motor neurons below the level of injury, including increased density, altered spine shape, and redistribution along dendritic branches. These abnormal spine morphologies accompanied the loss of H-reflex rate-dependent depression (RDD) and increased ratio of H-reflex to Mwave responses (H/M ratio). Above the level of injury, spine density decreased compared with below-injury spine profiles and spine distributions were similar to those for uninjured controls. As expected, there was no H-reflex hyperexcitability above the level of injury in forelimb H-reflex testing. Treatment with NSC23766, a Rac1-specific inhibitor, decreased the presence of abnormal dendritic spine profiles below the level of injury, restored RDD of the H-reflex, and decreased H/M ratios in SCI animals. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanistic relationship between abnormal dendritic spine remodeling in the spinal cord motor system and reflex dysfunction in SCI."

The cell replacement therapy is now one of the most promising methods for such injury. There are currently various methods to induce the differentiation of stem cells into neurons, but all extremely complex, slow and unstable. Here we report that the sodium hyaluronate collagen scaffold loaded with bFGF (bFGF-controlled releasing system, bFGF-CRS) can induce neural stem cells (NSCs) to differentiate into multi-type and mature functional neurons at a high percentage of 82 +/- 1.528% in two weeks. The quantitative real-time (QRT) PCR results reveal that a long-term activation of bFGF receptors could up-regulate ERK/MAPK signal pathways, thus facilitating the formation of presynaptic and postsynaptic structure among the induced neuronal cells (iN cells). The functional synaptic connections established among iN cells were detected by the planar multielectrode dish system. When jointly transplanting the bFGF-CRS and NSCs into the CA1 zone of the rat TBI area, the results suggested that bFGF-CRS provided an optimal microenvironment, which promoted survival, neuronal differentiation of transplanted NSCs and functional synapse formation not only among iN cells but also between iN cells and the host brain tissue in TBI rats, consequently leading to the cognitive function recovery of TBI rats. These findings in vitro and in vivo may lay a foundation for the application of bFGF-CRS and shed light on the delivery of exogenous cells or nutrients to the CNS injury or disease area."

Here, we review some of the key observations that helped identify some of these plastic mechanisms. At the core of this plasticity is the existence of a spinal central pattern generator (CPG) which is responsible for hindlimb locomotion as observed after a complete spinal cord section. However, normally, the CPG pattern is adapted by sensory inputs to take the environment into account and by supraspinal inputs in the context of goal-directed locomotion. We therefore also review some of the sensory and supraspinal mechanisms involved in the recovery of locomotion after partial spinal injury. We particularly stress a recent development using a dual spinal lesion paradigm in which a first partial spinal lesion is made which is then followed, some weeks later, by a complete spinalization. The results show that the spinal cord below the spinalization has been changed by the initial partial lesion suggesting that, in the recovery of locomotion after partial spinal lesion, plastic mechanisms within the spinal cord itself are very important."

The SCI animals were randomly assigned to five groups: sham control group, SCI model group, the methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) group, the 10 mg/kg apigenin treatment group and the 20 mg/kg apigenin treatment group. First, neuronal function after SCI was evaluated with Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) and the result showed that injured animals treated with apigenin showed a significant increase in BBB scores. To explore the underlying mechanism, antioxidative effect of apigenin was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities after SCI. Apigenin treatment reversed the decrease of SOD and GSH-Px activity, and the increase of MDA level caused by SCI, suggesting its antioxidative role in response to the injury. In addition, apigenin treatment decreased serum interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 release after SCI, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin. Finally, apigenin treatment affected the expression level of apoptosis-related gene Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3, which indicated its antiapoptosis role after SCI.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate if, like 5HT, endogenous sources of norepinephrine (NE) facilitate motoneuron PICs after chronic spinal transection. Cutaneous-evoked reflex responses in tail muscles of awake chronic spinal rats were measured after increasing presynaptic release of NE by administration of amphetamine. An increase in long-lasting reflexes, known to be mediated by the calcium component of the PIC (CaPIC), was observed even at low doses (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) of amphetamine. These findings were repeated in a reduced S2 in vitro preparation, demonstrating that the increased long-lasting reflexes by amphetamine were neural. Under intracellular voltage clamp, amphetamine application led to a large facilitation of the motoneuron CaPIC. This indicates that the increases in long-lasting reflexes induced by amphetamine in the awake animal were, in part, due to actions directly on the motoneuron. Reflex responses in acutely spinal animals were facilitated by amphetamine similar to chronic animals but only at doses that were ten times greater than that required in chronic animals (0.2 mg/kg chronic vs. 2.0 mg/kg acute), pointing to a development of supersensitivity to endogenous NE in chronic animals. In summary, the increases in long-lasting reflexes and associated motoneuron CaPICs by amphetamine are likely due to an increased release of endogenous NE, which motoneurons become supersensitive to in the chronic stages of spinal cord injury."

The purpose of this study was to assess the optimal dose of methylprednisolone for the treatment of rat spinal cord injury. Twenty-five male Wistar rats were subjected to an acute clip compression injury at 51 g for 1 min at C8-T1, and then received an intravenous bolus injection of one of the following 30 min after injury: vehicle, 30, 60, 120 or 240 mg kg(-1) methylprednisolone. SCBF was measured at the injury site and an adjacent area with the hydrogen clearance technique. Sensory evoked potentials following sciatic stimulation were recorded from the somatosensory and cerebellar cortices. Descending volleys were recorded from T9-10 spinal cord following cerebellar stimulation. SCBF and evoked potential recordings were repeated until perfusion-fixation at 4 h after injury. After injury, SCBF at both levels significantly dropped, and all evoked potentials disappeared in all animals. None of the doses of methylprednisolone improved post-traumatic SCBF, or evoked potentials. Quantitative histological assessment of the injured cords revealed no significant differences in hemorrhages or cavitation in the spinal cord among the treatment groups. This study showed that a single huge dose of methylprednisolone from 30 to 240 mg kg(-1) had no beneficial effects on the traumatized rat spinal cord in the acute stage."

We have further demonstrated that the observed alteration of NO metabolism is primarily responsible for the associated cardiovascular deconditioning. Recovery from acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is frequently complicated by orthostatic intolerance that is due to the combined effects of the disruption of efferent sympathetic pathway and cardiovascular deconditioning occasioned by prolonged confinement to bed. In this presentation, I will review the nature of altered NO metabolism and its role in the pathogenesis of microgravity-induced cardiovascular deconditioning. The possible relevance of the new findings to orthostatic intolerance in patients with acute SCI and its potential therapeutic implications will be discussed."

A purinergic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) receptor subtype, P2X4 receptor (P2X4R), has been considered as a potential target to diminish SCI-associated inflammatory responses. In this study, using a minipump-based infusion system, we found that intraspinal infusion with VPA for 3 days into injured spinal cord significantly improved hindlimb locomotion of rats with severe SCI induced by a 10-g NYU impactor dropping from the height of 50 mm onto the spinal T9/10 segment. The neuronal fibers in the injured spinal cord tissues were significantly preserved in VPA-treated rats compared with those observed in vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, the accumulation of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the injured spinal cord was attenuated in the animal group receiving VPA infusion. VPA also significantly reduced P2X4R expression post-SCI. Furthermore, in vitro study indicated that VPA, but not the other HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA), caused downregulation of P2X4R in microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-triggered signaling was involved in the effect of VPA on the inhibition of P2X4R gene expression. In addition to the findings from others, our results also provide important evidence to show the inhibitory effect of VPA on P2X4R expression in activated microglia, which may contribute to reduction of SCI-induced gliosis and subsequently preservation of spinal cord tissues.

The water content was calculated as the percent wet weight of the total weight. Prior to compression the capacity angle was close to 62-64-degrees. One day after compression the motor function was reduced significantly in all rats.

All animals in the control group, group A, were completely paraplegic with O% recovery by Tarlov criteria at 24 hours after the removal of the crossclamp. In contrast, all animals in group B, in which the combination of allopurinol and deferoxamine was used, completely recovered (100% recovery by Tarlov criteria), and at 24 hours after the ischemic episode they were able to walk with no difficulty and had intact sensation. Functional parameters of these animals fully correlated with the morphologic findings. Widespread acute neuronal injury and vacuolation of neuropil were observed in the control group of animals.

This Na+ leak likely occurs via incompletely inactivated voltage-gated Na+ channels. This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 mu M were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (less than or equal to 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 mu M), disopyramide (10-300 mu M) and bupivacaine (10-100 mu M) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 mu M. Procainamide (100-300 mu M) was ineffective. These results suggest that Na+ channel blockers, including commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, may be effective in protecting central white matter, which is a target for anoxic/ischemic injury in diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury."

However, there has been no study to investigate the therapeutic effect of rapamycin on neuropathic pain after SCI. In this study, we examined whether rapamycin reduces neuropathic pain following SCI in mice. We used a mouse model of thoracic spinal cord contusion injury, and divided the mice into the rapamycin-treated and the vehicle-treated groups. The rapamycin-treated mice were intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin (1 mg/kg) 4 h after SCI. The rapamycin treatment suppressed phosphorylated-p70S6K in the injured spinal cord that indicated inhibition of mTOR. The rapamycin treatment significantly improved not only locomotor function, but also mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the hindpaws after SCI. In an immunohistochemical analysis, Iba-1-stained microglia in the lumbar spinal cord was significantly decreased in the rapamycin-treated mice. In addition, the activity of p38 MAPK in the lumbar spinal cord was significantly attenuated by rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, phosphorylated-p38 MAPK-positive microglia was relatively decreased in the rapamycin-treated mice. These results indicated rapamycin administration in acute phase to reduce secondary neural tissue damage can contribute to the suppression of the microglial activation in the lumbar spinal cord and attenuate the development of neuropathic pain after SCI.

Moreover, several preclinical SCI studies have associated riluzole administration with improved functional outcomes and increased neural tissue preservation. Based on these findings, riluzole has attracted considerable interest as a potential neuroprotective drug for the treatment of SCI. Currently, a Phase I trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of riluzole in human SCI patients is being conducted by the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury.

After 4 h SCI, all animals in control or DNT-treated groups became paraparesic. Significant improvement was observed in DNT-treated group, 24 h after SCI, with respect to control. Traumatic SCI led to an increase in the lipid peroxidation and a decrease in enzymic or non-enzymic endogenous antioxidative defense systems, and increase in apoptotic cell numbers. DNT treatment prevented lipid peroxidation and augmented endogenous enzymic or non-enzymic antioxidative defense systems. Again, DNT treatment significantly decreased the apoptotic cell number induced by SCI.

The study showed that patients who received the drug within 8 hr after injury improved, whereas those who received the drug later did not. The drug significantly increased recovery even in severely injured patients who were admitted with no motor or sensory function below the lesion, contradicting a long-held dogma that such patients would not recover. Some researchers, however, have questioned the stratification of the patient population, the use of summed neurologic change scores, and the absence of functional assessments. The stratification by injury severity and treatment time was planned a priori and based on objective criteria. Detailed analyses revealed no differences between groups attributable to stratification or randomization. While multivariate analyses of the summed neurologic scores were used, the conclusions were corroborated by other analytical approaches that did not rely on summed scores. For example, treatment with methylprednisolone more than doubled the probability that patients would convert from quadriplegia or paraplegia to quadriparesis or paraparesis, analgesia to hypoalgesia, and anesthesia to hypoesthesia. The treatment also significantly improved neurologic scores in lumbosacral segments, indicating that beneficial effects were not limited to segments close to the lesion site. The treatment did not significantly affect mortality or morbidity. The study strongly suggests that methylprednisolone has significant beneficial effects in human spinal cord injury, that these effects occur only when the drug is given within 8 hr, and that it helps even in patients with severe spinal cord injuries. These conclusions have important implications for spinal cord injury care and research."

Four weeks after SCI, V2a INs showed almost no changes in baseline excitability or action potential properties; the only parameter that changed was a reduced input resistance. However, V2a INs became 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive to 5-HT. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that SCI caused a coordinated loss of serotonergic fibers and the 5-HT transporter (SERT). Blocking the SERT with citalopram in intact mice did not increase 5-HT sensitivity to the level seen after SCI. SCI also evoked an increase in 5-HT2C receptor cluster number and intensity, suggesting that several plastic changes cooperate in increasing 5-HT sensitivity. Our results suggest that different components of the spinal neuronal network responsible for coordinating locomotion are differentially affected by SCI, and highlight the importance of understanding these changes when considering therapies targeted at functional recovery."

Motor function, assessed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale for 8 weeks, was significantly better in GSHE (11.2+/-0.6, mean+/-S.E.M., n=8, at 8 weeks) than methylprednisolone (9.3+/-0.6) and vehicle (9.4+/-0.7) groups. The number of neurons in the red nuclei labeled with FluoroRuby placed caudally to the injury site was significantly higher in GSHE (158+/-9.3 mean S.E.M., n=4) compared with methylprednisolone (53+/-14.7) and vehicle (46+/-16.4) groups. Differences in the amount of spared SC tissue at the epicenter and neighboring areas were not significant among experimental groups. In a second series of experiments, using similar treatment groups (n=6), regional changes in microvascular SC blood flow were evaluated for 100 min by laser-Doppler flowmetry after clip compression injury. SC blood flow fell in vehicle-treated rats 20% below baseline and increased significantly with methylprednisolone approximately 12% above baseline; changes were not greater than 5% in rats given GSHE. In conclusion, GSHE given to rats early after moderate SC contusion/compression improves functional outcome and red nuclei neuron survival significantly better than methylprednisolone and vehicle, and stabilizes SC blood flow.

Based on data suggesting a key role of sodium and glutamate mediated cellular injury in models of spinal cord compression, we examined whether riluzole, a sodium channel/glutamate blocker, could improve neurobehavioral outcomes in a rat model of CSM. To produce chronic progressive compression of the cervical spinal cord, we used an established model of graded mechanical cord compromise developed in our laboratory. The chronic (8 weeks) mechanical compression of the cervical spinal cord resulted in persistent mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at 8 weeks. Moreover, we found increased expression of phosphorylated NRI and NR2B in the dorsal horns as well as astrogliosis and increased microglia expression in the dorsal horns after mechanical compression. Following daily systemic administration for 7 weeks after the induction of compression, riluzole (8 mg/kg) significantly attenuated forelimb and hindlimb mechanical allodynia and alleviated thermal hyperalgesia in the tail. Importantly, riluzole led to a decrease in swing phase duration, an increase in hind leg swing speed and an increase paw intensity in gait analysis. Riluzole also decreased the number of phosphorylated NR1 and phosphorylated NR2B positive cells in the dorsal horns and the microglia activation in the dorsal horns. Together, our results indicate that systemic riluzole administration during chronic cervical spinal cord compression is effective at protecting spinal cord tissue, preserving neurobehavioral function and alleviating neuropathic pain, possibly by decreasing NMDA receptor phosphorylation in astrocytes and by eliminating microglia activation. As such, riluzole represents a promising clinical treatment for CSM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority. Collaborative international efforts have led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for traumatic SCI based on robust evaluation of current evidence.

The functional consequences of experimental SCI have been assessed in many ways. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of MPSS vs. saline solution (SS) following moderate T10 contusion injury in rat. Functional recovery was evaluated using the 21-point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor recovery scale, the inclined plane, the beam walk, footprint analysis and the horizontal ladder. To optimize the precision and accuracy of functional results we examined the locomotion on a treadmill using three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Stereology was used to estimate the amount of damaged tissue. The results of the traditional functional methods showed that administration of the NASCIS dosage of MPSS following acute spinal cord contusion did not lead to any significant differences in the functional recovery of MPSS- vs. SS-treated animals. More importantly, the results of the 3D kinematic showed that the MPSS administration did not affect the flexion/extension of the hip, knee and ankle joints during the step cycle. Finally, stereological results revealed no statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups. Altogether, our results support data previously reported by several authors, suggesting that MPSS does not lead to improved functional outcome following experimental acute SCI. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Melatonin, known as a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have an effect on lipid peroxidation following experimental SCI. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of MP and melatonin on neurological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological recovery. Female albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into five groups of 18 rats each and six rats for the control group. Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of NIP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action."

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacologic agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger alpha tocopherol (i.e., vitamin E) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurologic recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for the treatment of acute neural injury. The glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant dosages, improves chronic neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of methylprednisolone is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions. Novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids have been developed that are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than methylprednisolone. One of these, U74006F or tirilazad mesylate, has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials. Compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-aminosteroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) have also recently shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds adds further support to the concept that lipid peroxidation is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacologic neuroprotection."

Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC50 of 2 mu M. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 mu M BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K-d = 170 mu M) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K-d = 5 mu M) and even more tightly Downloaded from molpharm. aspetjournals. org at Thomson Scientific on July 15, 2011 (K-d = 0.2 mu M) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 mu M. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels."

Rats received an incomplete thoracic contusion injury, in the presence or absence of TTX (0.15 nmole) injected focally, beginning at 15 min prior to injury. Six weeks later, cell density was significantly increased in the residual white matter of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral funiculi, both rostral and caudal to the injury site in both TTX-treated and injury control groups. Oligodendrocyte and astrocyte density was similar to normal but large numbers of cells expressing microglia/macrophage markers were present.

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, pSAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis.

Perfusion of the spinal cord in 0-Ca2+ Ringer solution resulted in significantly improved recovery of the compound action potential. Similarly, removal of Na+ from the perfusate resulted in significantly improved recovery of conduction in dorsal column axons. Exposure of the anoxic spinal cord to the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), the Na-Ca exchange blockers benzamil and bepridil, Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride and harmaline, and perfusion in Ringer solution with pH adjusted to 6.4, all resulted in improved recovery. The tertiary anesthetics procaine and lidocaine, as well as phenytoin and carbamazepine, also resulted in improved recovery of compound action potential amplitude after 60 min of anoxia. These results demonstrate that a significant component of irreversible loss of conduction, following anoxic injury of the dorsal columns, is Ca2+-dependent. Moreover, these results demonstrate that TTX-inhibitable Na+ channels participate in the pathophysiology of anoxic injury in spinal cord white matter, and indicate that reverse Na-Ca exchange provides a route for at least part of the damaging influx of Ca2+ into an intracellular compartment in anoxic spinal cord white matter. Our results also suggest that extracellular acidosis may have a protective effect on anoxic spinal cord white matter, and support the hypothesis that anoxic injury of spinal cord white matter may involve the Na+-H+ exchanger."

The demyelination can be repaired by remyelination in both humans and rodents, and even within the CNS remyelination can be achieved by endogenous and/or exogenous Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the PNS. Remyelinated axons can often conduct impulses securely, but the organization of ion channels at long-term remyelinated nodes is not known. In the present study, the expression of voltage-gated sodium (Na-v) and potassium (K-v) channels along central axons remyelinated by endogenous Schwann cells has been studied in lesions induced more than 1 year previously by the intraspinal injection of ethidium bromide (EB). The expression of the channels at long-term nodes formed by Schwann cell remyelination has been compared with that present in nascent nodes formed in the adult at 18 and 23 days post-EB injection. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that long-term nodes formed by Schwann cell remyelination exhibit a clustering of Na(v)1.6 sodium channels within the nodal membrane, with the Shaker-type potassium channel K(v)1.2 segregated within the juxtaparanodal region, similar to the arrangement at normal mature CNS nodes. Na(v)1.2 was not detected at nodes formed by Schwann cells at any stage of their development. Moreover, Na(v)1.6, but not Na(v)1.2, was clustered at nascent nodes formed by remyelinating Schwann cells 18 and 23 days following EB injection. These observations show that endogenous Schwann cells can establish and maintain nodes of Ranvier on central axons for over one year, and that the nodes exhibit an apparently normal distribution of sodium and potassium channels, with Na(v)1.6 the predominant subtype of sodium channel present at such nodes at all stages of their development."

Light and electron microscopic analysis showed that increasing periods of oxygen/glucose deprivation (up to 1 h) caused, after a 90-min recovery period, the appearance of increasing numbers of swollen axons whose ultrastructure indicated that they were irreversibly damaged. This conclusion was supported by experiments showing that the damage persisted after a longer recovery period (3 h). To quantify the axonal pathology, an automated morphometric method, based on measurement of the density of swollen axons, was developed. Omission of Ca(2+) from the incubation solution during 1 h of oxygen/glucose deprivation land for 15 min either side) completely prevented the axonopathy (assessed following 90 min recovery). Omission of Na(+) was also effective, though less so (70% protection). The classical Na(+) channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (1 mu M), provided 92% protection. In view of this evidence implicating Na(+) channels in the pathogenesis of the axonal damage, the effects of three different Na(+) channel inhibitors, with known neuroprotective properties towards gray matter in in vivo models of cerebral ischaemia, were tested. The compounds used were lamotrigine and the structurally-related molecules, BW619C89 and BW1003C87. All three compounds protected the axons to varying degrees, the maximal efficacies (observed at 30 to 100 mu M) being in the order: BW619C89 (>95% protection) > BW1003C87 (70%)> lamotrigine (50%). At a concentration affording near complete protection (100 mu M), BW619C89 had no significant effect on the optic nerve compound action potential. Experiments in which BW619C89 was added at different times indicated that its effects were exerted during two distinct phases, one (accounting for about 50% protection) was during the early stage of oxygen/glucose deprivation itself and the other (also about 50%) during the first 15 min of recovery in normal incubation solution."

Na+ channel blockers have thus been shown to be protective in an in vitro anoxic rat optic nerve model. Mexiletine (10 mu M-1 mM), an antiarrhythmic and use-dependent Na+ channel blocker, was also significantly protective, as measured by recovery of the compound action potential after a 60 min anoxic exposure in vitro. More importantly, mexiletine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly protected optic nerves from injury in a model of in situ ischemia. This in situ model is more clinically relevant as it addresses drug pharmacokinetics, toxicity and CNS penetration.

We previously reported that degeneration of oligodendrocytes and neurons that occurs after SCI is associated with the development of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the progressive accumulation of the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP. Since following ER stress, the balance between the pro-survival chaperone BiP and CHOP drives the cell destiny, we aimed to find drugs that modulate this ratio in favour of the former. We found that valproate (VPA) induced a significant reduction of CHOP levels after ER stress in an organotypic-based culture of spinal cord in vitro. We then administered different doses of VPA to rats following spinal cord contusion, and found that the treatment caused a marked reduction of CHOP levels early after the lesion. In addition, VPA administration partially prevented cord tissue, myelin and axonal loss, and significantly increased the relative number of surviving oligodendrocytes in the damaged spinal cord. Besides, VPA-treated rats showed better recovery of the locomotor activity than vehicle-treated rats after SCI. Since VPA is a drug already in clinical use, these results open the avenue for its therapeutical use in SCI as well as in demyelinating disorders. (c) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rats were treated with riluzole (8 mg/kg) at 1 hour (P1) and 3 hours (P3) after injury or with vehicle. Afterward, P1 and P3 groups received riluzole (6 (mg/kg) every 12 hours for 7 days.

Von Frey stimuli did not reveal an increase in at level or below level mechanical allodynia. Sensory-evoked potential recordings and quantification of axonal cytoskeleton demonstrated a riluzole-mediated improvement in axonal integrity and function. Histopathological and retrograde tracing studies demonstrated that delayed administration leads to tissue preservation and reduces apoptosis and inflammation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was undertaken to examine the pharmacokinetics of riluzole. Riluzole penetrates the spinal cord in 15 min, and SCI slowed elimination of riluzole from the spinal cord, resulting in a longer half-life and higher drug concentration in spinal cord and plasma. Initiation of riluzole treatment 1 and 3 hours post-SCI led to functional, histological, and molecular benefits. While extrapolation of post-injury time windows from rat to man is challenging, evidence from SCI-related biomarker studies would suggest that the post-injury time window is likely to be at least 12 hours in man."

The low density of sodium channels in the internodal axon membrane will impede conduction after demyelination.

Results of blood flow assessment confirmed a true ischemic episode of 30 minutes for all animals in all groups. The blood flow fell significantly during ischemia (p < 0.01) and a hyperemic response was evident in the early reperfusion period. AH animals in control group A were paraplegic. The group B (deferoxamine) results were superior; 85 % had grade III function on a modified Tarlov scale, with animals in the group standing and even walking with difficulty.

First, neuronal induction was acquired through the formation of neurospheres, followed by neuronal maturation, based on cAMP and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) signaling. At the ultrastructural level, it was shown that the intra-spheral microenvironment promoted intercellular communication. hDPSCs grew out of the neurospheres in vitro and established a neurogenic differentiated hDPSC culture (d-hDPSCs) upon cAMP and NT-3 signaling. d-hDPSCs were characterized by the increased expression of neuronal markers such as neuronal nuclei, microtubule-associated protein 2, neural cell adhesion molecule, growth-associated protein 43, synapsin I, and synaptophysin compared with nondifferentiated hDPSCs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and nerve growth factor differed between d-hDPSCs and hDPSCs. d-hDPSCs acquired neuronal features, including multiple intercommunicating cytoplasmic extensions and increased vesicular transport, as shown by the electron microscopic observation. Patch clamp analysis demonstrated the functional activity of d-hDPSCs by the presence of tetrodotoxin- and tetraethyl ammonium-sensitive voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, respectively.

Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p < 0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na+ blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 contusion SCI after being fed normal chow or chow containing phenytoin; serum levels of phenytoin were within therapeutic range at the time of injury. At various timepoints after injury, quantitative assessment of lesion volumes, axonal degeneration, axonal conduction, and functional locomotor recovery were performed. When compared to controls, phenytoin-treated animals demonstrated reductions in the degree of destruction of gray and white matter surrounding the lesion epicenter, sparing of axons within the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) and dorsal column (DC) system rostral to the lesion site, and within the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) caudal to the lesion site, and enhanced axonal conduction across the lesion site. Improved performance in measures of skilled locomotor function was observed in pbenytoin-treated animals.

Immediately after spinal cord injury (SCI), a devastating paralysis results from the loss of brain stem and cortical innervation of spinal neurons that control movement, including a loss of serotonergic (5-HT) innervation of motoneurons. Over time, motoneurons recover from denervation and function autonomously, exhibiting large persistent calcium currents (Ca PICs) that both help with functional recovery and contribute to uncontrolled muscle spasms. Here we systematically evaluated which 5-HT receptor subtypes influence PICs and spasms after injury. Spasms were quantified by recording the long-lasting reflexes (LLRs) on ventral roots in response to dorsal root stimulation, in the chronic spinal rat, in vitro. Ca PICs were quantified by intracellular recording in synaptically isolated motoneurons. Application of agonists selective to 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors (including BW723C86) significantly increased the LLRs and associated Ca PICs, whereas application of agonists to 5-HT1, 5-HT2A, 5-HT3, or 5-HT4/5/6/7 receptors (e. g., 8-OH-DPAT) did not. The 5-HT 2 receptor agonist-induced increases in LLRs were dose dependent, with doses for 50% effects (EC50) highly correlated with published doses for agonist receptor binding (K-i) at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors. Application of selective antagonists to 5-HT2B (e. g., RS127445) and 5-HT2C (SB242084) receptors inhibited the agonist-induced increase in LLR. However, antagonists that are known to specifically be neutral antagonists at 5-HT2B/C receptors (e. g., RS127445) had no effect when given by themselves, indicating that these receptors were not activated by residual 5-HT in the spinal cord. In contrast, inverse agonists (such as SB206553) that block constitutive activity at 5-HT2B or 5-HT2C receptors markedly reduced the LLRs, indicating the presence of constitutive activity in these receptors. 5-HT2B or 5-HT2C receptors were confirmed to be on motoneurons by immunolabeling. In summary, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors on motoneurons become constitutively active after injury and ultimately contribute to recovery of motoneuron function and emergence of spasms."

To achieve CSR that mimics a common pattern of human sleep loss, we quantified a new procedure of sleep disruption in mice by a week of consecutive sleep recording. We then tested the hypothesis that CSR compromises microvascular function. CSR not only diminished endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase, endothelin1, and glucose transporter expression in cerebral microvessels of the BBB, but it also decreased 2-deoxy-glucose uptake by the brain. The expression of several tight junction proteins also was decreased, whereas the level of cyclooxygenase-2 increased. This coincided with an increase of paracellular permeability of the BBB to the small tracers sodium fluorescein and biotin. CSR for 6 d was sufficient to impair BBB structure and function, although the increase of paracellular permeability returned to baseline after 24 h of recovery sleep.

Research has shown that an accumulation of intracellular sodium as a result of trauma-induced perturbation of voltage-sensitive sodium channel activity is a key early mechanism in the secondary injury cascade. As such, voltage-sensitive sodium channels are an important therapeutic target for the treatment of spinal cord trauma. This review describes the evolution of acute spinal cord injury and provides a rationale for the clinical utility of sodium channel blockers, particularly riluzole, in the management of spinal cord trauma."

Here, we transplanted olfactory ensheathing cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing donor rats [GFP-olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs)] into a region of spinal cord demyelination and found extensive remyelination, which included the development of mature nodal, paranodal, and juxtaparanodal domains, as assessed by ultrastructural, immunocytochemical, and electrophysiological analyses. In remyelinated axons, Na(v)1.6 was clustered at nodes, whereas K(v)1.2 was aggregated in juxtaparanodal regions, recapitulating the distribution of these channels within mature nodes of uninjured axons. Moreover, the recruitment of Na-v and K-v channels to specific membrane domains at remyelinated nodes persisted for at least 8 weeks after GFP-OEC transplantation. In vivo electrophysiological recordings demonstrated enhanced conduction along the GFP-OEC-remyelinated axons. These findings indicate that, in addition to forming myelin, engrafted GFP-OECs provide an environment that supports the development and maturation of nodes of Ranvier and the restoration of impulse conduction in central demyelinated axons."

The mechanisms for its beneficial actions are not entirely clear, but experimental evidence suggests MPSS affords some degree of neuroprotection. As many studies with rat models of SCI have been unable to demonstrate improved behavioral outcome or tissue sparing after MPSS treatment, we chose to stereologically assess whether lit alters lesion volume and tissue sparing over time, as well as long-term behavioral recovery. Adult rats subjected to contusion SCI with the NYU impactor were administered either MPSS or saline for 24 hr beginning 5 min post injury. Over time the lesion dimensions were extremely dynamic, such that by 6 weeks post injury the volumes were reduced to a third of those seen after the first week. MPSS marginally reduced lesion volumes across time vs. controls, but the amount of spared gray and white matter remained unaltered between the two groups. Behavioral results further showed that MPSS failed to improve recovery of hind-limb function. These findings add to the emerging scrutiny of MPSS as the standard therapy for acute SCI, as well as indicate the existence of a therapeutic window for tissue sparing restricted to the first several days after this type of SCI in rats. Equally important, our results caution the use of lesion volume dimensions or percent tissue sparing at the epicenter as indicators of therapeutic efficacy because neither reflects the actual amount of tissue sparing.

Excessive cellular Ca2+ accumulation is a common phenomenon after anoxia/ischemia or mechanical trauma to white matter, leading to irreversible injury because of overactivation of multiple Ca2+ dependent biochemical pathways. In the present study, we examined the role of Na+-Ca2+ exchange, a ubiquitous Ca2+ transport mechanism, in anoxic and traumatic injury to rat spinal dorsal columns in vitro. Excised tissue was maintained in a recording chamber at 37 degrees C and injured by exposure to an anoxic atmosphere for 60 min or locally compressed with a force of 2 g for 15 s. Mean compound action potential amplitude recovered to approximate to 25% of control after anoxia and to approximate to 30% after trauma. Inhibitors of Na+-Ca2+ exchange (50 mu M bepridil or 10 mu M KB-R7943) improved functional recovery to approximate to 60% after anoxia and approximate to 70% after traumatic compression. These inhibitors also prevented the increase in calpain-mediated spectrin breakdown products induced by anoxia. We conclude that, at physiological temperature, reverse Na+-Ca2+ exchange plays an important role in cellular Ca2+ overload and irreversible damage after anoxic and traumatic injury to dorsal column white matter tracts."

Although antiinflammatory treatment using the glucocorticoid methyprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) improved outcomes in several multicenter clinical trials, additional clinical experience suggests that MPSS is only modestly beneficial in SCI and poses a risk for serious complications. Recent work has shown that erythropoietin (EPO) moderates CNS tissue injury, in part by reducing inflammation, limiting neuronal apoptosis, and restoring vascular autoregulation. We determined whether EPO and MPSS act synergistically in SCI. Using a rat model of contusive SCI, we compared the effects of EPO [500-5,000 units/kg of body weight (kg-bw)] with MPSS (30 mg/kg-bw) for proinflammatory cytokine production, histological damage, and motor function at 1 month after a compression injury. Although high-dose EPO and MPSS suppressed proinflarnmatory cytokines within the injured spinal cord, only EPO was associated with reduced microglial infiltration, attenuated scar formation, and sustained neurological improvement. Unexpectedly, coadministration of MPSS antagonized the protective effects of EPO, even though the EPO receptor was up-regulated normally after injury. These data illustrate that the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines alone does not necessarily prevent secondary injury and suggest that glucocorticoids should not be coadministered in clinical trials evaluating the use of EPO for treatment of SCI."

However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment.

Quantitative histopathology at 8 weeks postinjury showed that mt treatment significantly reduced tissue loss at the injury site, with greater effect on sparing of WM than gray matter. TTX did not change the pattern of chronic histopathology typical of this SCI model, but restricted its extent, tripled the area of residual WM at the epicenter, and reduced the average length of the lesions. Serotonin immunoreactivity caudal to the epicenter, a marker for descending motor control axons, was nearly threefold that of VEH controls. The increase in WM at the epicenter was significantly correlated with the decrease in functional deficits. The TTX group exhibited a significantly enhanced recovery of coordinated hindlimb functions, more normal hindlimb reflexes, and earlier establishment of a reflex bladder. The results demonstrate that Na+ channels play a critical role in WM loss in vivo after SCI."

Our study examined if acute administration of MP (30 mg/kg i.v. at 5 min, and 2 and 4 h after injury) and IL-10 (30mg/kg i.p. at 30 min after injury) increases the efficacy of Schwann cell (SC) or SC plus olfactory ensheathing glia (SC/OEG) grafts transplanted into rat thoracic cord 1 week after contusive injury. Efficacy was determined by histology, anterograde and retrograde tracing, immunohistochemistry for gliosis and specific nerve fibers, and several behavioral tests. Administration of MP/IL-10 or SC or SC/OEG transplantation significantly increased the total volume of a 9-mm segment of cord encompassing the injury site at 12 weeks. The combination of either SC or SC/OEG transplantation with MP/IL-10 most significantly reduced cavitation. The individual treatments all significantly increased the volume of normal-appearing tissue compared to injury-only controls; however, significant decreases in the volume of normal-appearing tissue were seen when MP/IL-10 and cell grafts were combined compared to MP/IL-10 alone. SC/OEG grafts were effective in promoting serotonergic fiber growth into the graft and led to more reticulospinal fibers caudal to the graft; combination with MP/IL-10 did not further increase fiber number. Only the combination of MP/IL-10 with SC/OEG transplants significantly improved gross locomotor performance (BBB scores) over injury-only controls. MP/IL-10 given prior to SC-only transplants, however, worsened behavioral outcome. Because beneficial effects of MP/IL-10 were not always additive when combined with cell transplantation, we need to understand (1) how tissue protective agents may transform the milieu of the injured spinal cord to the benefit or detriment of later transplanted cells and (2) whether neuroprotectants need to be re-administered at the time of cell grafting or less invasive transplantation techniques employed to reduce damage to tissue spared by an earlier protection strategy."

In this study, the effectiveness of combining ECs and MP after SCI was investigated for the first time. After lesioning the corticospinal tract in adult rats, ECs were transplanted into the lesion, and MP was administered for 24 hr. At 6 weeks after injury, functional recovery was assessed by measuring successful performance of directed forepaw reaching (DFR), expressed as percentages. Axonal regeneration was analyzed by counting the number of corticospinal axons, anterogradely labeled with biotin dextran tetramethylrhodamine, caudal to the lesion. Lesioned control rats, receiving either no treatment or vehicle, had abortive axonal regrowth (1 mm) and poor DFR success (38 and 42%, respectively). Compared with controls, MP-treated rats had significantly more axons 7 mm caudal to the lesion, and DFR performance was significantly improved (57%). Rats that received ECs in combination with MP had significantly more axons than all other lesioned rats up to 13 mm. Successful DFR performance was significantly higher in rats with EC transplants, both without (72%) and with (78%) MP, compared with other lesioned rats. These data confirm previous reports that ECs promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord lesions. In addition, this research provides evidence that, when used in combination, MP and ECs improve axonal regrowth up to 13 mm caudal to the lesion at 6 weeks after injury."

While utility of these therapeutic options provides modest benefits, there is a critical need to identify novel approaches to treat or repair the injured spinal cord in hope to, at the very least, improve upon the patient's quality of life. Thankfully, several discoveries at the preclinical level are now transitioning into the clinical arena. These include the Surgical Treatment for Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (STASCIS) Trial to evaluate the role and timing of surgical decompression for acute SCI, neuroprotection with the semisynthetic second generation tetracycline derivative, minocycline; aiding axonal conduction with the potassium channel blockers, neuroregenerative/neuroprotective approaches with the Rho antagonist, Cethrin (R); the use of anti-NOGO monoclonal antibodies to augment plasticity and regeneration; as well as cell-mediated repair with stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and olfactory ensheathing cells.

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacological agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger vitamin E (i.e., alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurological recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for treatment of acute neural-injury. The glucocorticoid steroid, methylprednisolone (MP), has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant doses, improves chronic neurological recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of MP is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions, as evidenced by the efficacy of the novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids, which are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than MP. One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently the subject of phase II clinical trials. Recently, compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-aminosteroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) also have shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds further supports the concept that LP is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacological neuroprotection."

Ten randomized controlled trials examining methylprednisolone sodium succinate, tirilizad mesylate, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, thyrotropin releasing hormone, gacyclidine, naloxone, and nimodipine have been completed. Although the primary outcomes in these trials were laregely negative, a secondary analysis of the North American Spinal Cord Injury Study II demonstrated that when administered within 8 hours of injury, methylprednisolone sodium succinate was associated with modest clinical benefits, which need to be weighed against potential complications. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (Phase II trial) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (Phase II and III trials) also showed some promise, but we are unaware of plans for future trials with these agents. These studies have, however, yielded many insights into the conduct of clinical trials for SCI. Several current or planned clinical trials are exploring interventions such as early surgical decompression (Surgical Treatment of Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study) and electrical field stimulation, neuroprotective strategies such as riluzole and minocycline, the inactivation of myelin inhibition by blocking Nogo and Rho, and the transplantation of various cellular substrates into the injured cord. Unfortunately, some experimental and poorly characterized SCI therapies are being offered outside a formal investigational structure, which will yield findings of limited scientific value and risk harm to patients with SCI who are understandably desperate for any intervention that might improve their function. Taken together, recent advances suggest that optimism for patients and clinicians alike is justified, as there is real hope that several safe and effective therapies for SCI may become available over the next decade.

Locomotor recovery after complete spinalization (complete SCI) must depend on the presence of spinal circuitry capable of generating the complex sequential activation of various leg muscles. This is achieved by an intrinsic spinal circuitry, termed the central pattern generator (CPG), working in conjunction with sensory feedback from the legs. After SCI, different changes in cellular and circuit properties occur spontaneously and can be promoted by pharmacological, electrical, or rehabilitation strategies. After partial SCI, hindlimb locomotor recovery can result from regeneration or sprouting of spared pathways, but also from mechanisms observed after complete SCI, namely changes within the intrinsic spinal circuitry and sensory inputs."

The pathobiology of SCI involves a primary mechanical insult to the spinal cord and activation of a delayed secondary cascade of events, which ultimately causes progressive degeneration of the spinal cord. Whereas cell death from the mechanical injury is predominated by necrosis, secondary injury events trigger a continuum of necrotic and apoptotic cell death mechanisms. These secondary events include vascular abnormalities, ischemia-reperfusion, glutamate excitotoxicity and disturbances in ionic homeostasis, oxidative cell injury, and a robust inflammatory response. No gold standard therapy for SCI has been established, although clinical trials with methylprednisolone (NASCIS II and III) and GM-1 ganglioside (Maryland and Sygen) have demonstrated modest, albeit potentially important therapeutic benefits. In light of the overwhelming impact of SCI on the individual, other therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. A number of promising pharmacological therapies are currently under investigation for neuroprotective abilities in animal models of SCI. These include the sodium (Na+) channel blocker riluzole, the tetracycline derivative minocycline, the fusogen copolymer polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the tissue-protective hormone erythropoietin (EPO).

It stems from the interactions of four researchers involved in basic and clinical research who presented their work at a dedicated Symposium of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego. After SCI, primary and secondary damage occurs and several endogenous processes are triggered that may foster or hinder axonal reconnection from supralesional structures. Studies in animals show that some of these processes can be enhanced or decreased by exogenous interventions using drugs to diminish repulsive barriers (anti- Nogo, anti- Rho) that prevent regeneration and/or sprouting of axons. Cell grafts are also envisaged to enhance beneficial immunological mechanisms ( autologous macrophages, vaccines) or remyelinate axons (oligodendrocytes derived from stem cells). Some of these treatments could be planned concurrently with neurosurgical approaches that are themselves beneficial to decrease secondary damage ( e. g., decompression/reconstructive spinal surgery). Finally, rehabilitative approaches based on the presence of functional networks (i. e., central pattern generator) below the lesion combined with the above neurobiological approaches may produce significant functional recovery of some sensorimotor functions, such as locomotion, by ensuring an optimal function of endogenous spinal networks and establishing new dynamic interactions with supralesional structures. More work is needed on all fronts, but already the results offer great hope for functional recovery after SCI based on sound basic and clinical neuroscience research."

In this study, we examined the role of Na+ in mediating traumatic injury to spinal cord axons. Dorsal column segments from adult rats (n = 87) were isolated and maintained in an in vitro recording chamber while being superfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution (95% O-2/5% CO2, 25 degrees C). Selected experiments (n = 10) also were done at 33 degrees C. Compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded from microelectrodes. Injury was performed by compression of the dorsal column segment for 15 sec with a modified aneurysm clip exerting a closing force of 2 gm. With injury, the CAP decreased to 72.1 +/- 9.6% of baseline values. Removal of extracellular Na+ and replacement with the impermeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine enhanced recovery of the CAP to 98.3 +/- 18.3% (p < 0.05) of baseline. The Na+ channel blockers tetrodotoxin and procaine also improved recovery of the CAP to 96.3 +/- 23.7% (p < 0.05) and 82.8 +/- 4.6% (p < 0.05) of baseline values, respectively. In contrast, increasing Na+ permeability with veratridine resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude after 1 hr of trauma (60.1 +/- 8.4%, p < 0.05). Similarly, prevention of extrusion of Nai from the intracellular compartment by inhibiting the Na+-K+-ATPase pump with ouabain resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude at 1 hr after trauma (56.7 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.05). The Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride (100 mu M) and harmaline (100 mu M) significantly improved recovery after injury to 89.6 +/- 17.0% (p < 0.05) and 85.7 +/- 7.2% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively. However, administration of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange blockers benzamil (100 or 500 mu M) and bepridil (50 mu M) was ineffective. In summary, reduction of extracellular Na+ confers neuroprotection after spinal cord injury in vitro. Intracellular sodium rises appear to be mediated by voltage-gated Na+ channels. Blockade of the Na+-H+ exchanger also is neuroprotective, possibly by reducing intracellular acidosis. Furthermore, prevention of extrusion of intracellular Na+ by the Na+-K+-ATPase pump exacerbates the effects of compression trauma. However, reverse operation of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger does not explain the injurious effects of Na+ in traumatically injured CNS white matter."

Spinal cord injury was caused by dropping a rod weighing 10 gm from a height of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 cm onto the rat spinal cord at T-10, which had been exposed via laminectomy. The lesion volumes were quantified from spinal cord Na and K shifts at 24 hours after injury and the results were verified histologically in separate experiments. A single dose of MP (30 mg/kg), given 5 minutes after injury, reduced 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes by 56% (p = 0.0052), 28% (p = 0.0065), and 13% (p > 0.05) in the three injury-severity groups, respectively, compared to similarly injured control groups treated with vehicle only. Methylprednisolone also prevented injury-induced hyponatremia and increased body weight loss in the spine-injured rats. When used alone, GM1 (10 to 30 mg/kg) had little or no effect on any measured variable compared to vehicle controls; when given concomitantly with MP, GM1 blocked the neuroprotective effects of MP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, GM1 partially prevented MP-induced reductions in lesion volumes, while 10 to 30 mg/kg of GM1 completely blocked these effects of MP. The effects of MP on injury-induced hyponatremia and body weight loss were also blocked by GM1. Thus, GM1 antagonized both central and peripheral effects of MP in spine-injured rats."

The state of knowledge concerning the neuroprotective pharmacology of methylprednisolone, including mechanism(s) of action, dosing requirements, and time-action considerations is reviewed, as are the results of studies with high doses in experimental and clinical head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral ischemia. A primary neuroprotective mechanism of action in each of these cases is hypothesized to involve the ability of high doses of methylprednisolone to inhibit oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, although additional mechanisms may contribute. Unresolved issues are also addressed, including the therapeutic window, optimum duration of treatment, and rational combination with other neuroprotective agents. A newer methylprednisolone pro-drug with improved solution stability is discussed, together with a brief consideration of novel nonglucocorticoid steroids that surpass methylprednisolone's lipid antioxidant effects without unwanted glucocorticoid properties."

Although it is well characterized in non-neuronal cells, a proliferation of papers over the past few years has revealed a key role for the UPR in normal neuronal function and as an important driver of neurodegenerative diseases. A complex scenario is emerging in which distinct UPR signalling modules have specific and even opposite effects on neurodegeneration depending on the disease context. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent findings addressing the biological relevance of ER stress in the nervous system."

It has been shown recently that in models of peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord microglia can become activated and contribute to development of pain. Considering their role in pain after peripheral injury, and because microglia are known to become activated after SCI, we tested the hypothesis that activated microglia contribute to chronic pain after SCI. In this study, adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent T9 spinal cord contusion injury. Four weeks after injury, when lumbar dorsal horn multi-receptive neurons became hyperresponsive and when behavioral nociceptive thresholds were decreased to both mechanical and thermal stimuli, intrathecal infusions of the microglial inhibitor minocycline were initiated. Electrophysiological experiments showed that minocycline rapidly attenuated hyperresponsiveness of lumbar dorsal horn neurons. Behavioral data showed that minocycline restored nociceptive thresholds, at which time spinal microglial cells assumed a quiescent morphological phenotype. Levels of phosphorylated-p38 were decreased in SCI animals receiving minocycline. Cessation of delivery of minocycline resulted in an immediate return of pain-related phenomena. These results suggest an important role for activated microglia in the maintenance of chronic central below-level pain after SCI and support the newly emerging role of non-neuronal immune cells as a contributing factor in post-SCI pain."

In patients treated with methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury, increased recovery of neurological function was seen at 6 weeks and at 6 months and continued to be observed 1 year after injury. For motor function, this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.030), and was found in patients with total sensory and motor loss in the emergency room (p = 0.019) and in those with some preservation of motor and sensory function (p = 0.024). Naloxone-treated patients did not show significantly greater recovery. Patients treated after 8 hours of injury recovered less motor function if receiving methylprednisolone (p = 0.08) or naloxone (p = 0.10) as compared with those given placebo. Complication and mortality rates were similar in either group of treated patients as compared with the placebo group. The authors conclude that treatment with the study dose of methylprednisolone is indicated for acute spinal cord trauma, but only if it can be started within 8 hours of injury."

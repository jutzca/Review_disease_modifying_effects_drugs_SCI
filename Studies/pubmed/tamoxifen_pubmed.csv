In these mouse models, Cre-recombination is not induced until tamoxifen is administered, which allows researchers to have temporal control of genetic modifications. Interestingly, tamoxifen has been identified as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury patients due to its neuroprotective properties. It is also reparative in that it stimulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, it is unknown whether tamoxifen is neuroprotective and neuroreparative when administration is delayed after SCI. To properly interpret data from transgenic mice in which tamoxifen treatment is delayed after SCI, it is necessary to identify the effects of tamoxifen alone on anatomical and functional recovery. In this study, female and male mice received a moderate mid-thoracic spinal cord contusion. Mice were then gavaged with corn oil or a high dose of tamoxifen from 19-22 days post-injury, and sacrificed 42 days post-injury. All mice underwent behavioral testing for the duration of the study, which revealed that tamoxifen treatment did not impact hindlimb motor recovery. Similarly, histological analyses revealed that tamoxifen had no effect on white matter sparing, total axon number, axon sprouting, glial reactivity, cell proliferation, oligodendrocyte number, or myelination, but tamoxifen did decrease the number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horn. Semi-thin sections confirmed that axon demyelination and remyelination were unaffected by tamoxifen. Sex-specific responses to tamoxifen were also assessed, and there were no significant differences between female and male mice. These data suggest that delayed tamoxifen administration after SCI does not change functional recovery or improve tissue sparing in female or male mice."

Driving Cre expression specifically in injured neurons has not been previously possible: we sought to address this limitation in mice using a Cre-ERT2 construct driven by a reliable indicator of axotomy, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). When crossed with reporter mice, a significant amount of recombination was achieved (without tamoxifen treatment) in peripherally-projecting sensory, sympathetic, and motoneurons after peripheral nerve crush in hemizygotes (65-80% by 16 d) and was absent in uninjured neurons. Importantly, injury-induced recombination did not occur in Schwann cells distal to the injury, and with a knock-out-validated antibody we verified an absence of ATF3 expression. Functional recovery following sciatic nerve crush in ATF3-deficient mice (both hemizygotes and homozygotes) was delayed, indicating previously unreported haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we crossed the ATF3-CreERT2 line with a floxed phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) line and show significantly improved axonal regeneration, as well as more complete recovery of neuromuscular function. We also demonstrate the utility of the ATF3-CreERT2 hemizygous line by characterizing recombination after lateral spinal hemisection (C8/T1), which identified specific populations of ascending spinal cord neurons (including putative spinothalamic and spinocerebellar) and descending supraspinal neurons (rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and hypothalamic). We anticipate these mice will be valuable in distinguishing axotomized from uninjured neurons of several different classes (e.g., via reporter expression), and in probing the function of any number of genes as they relate to neuronal injury and regeneration."

Tamoxifen exerts beneficial effects in male and female rodents but a gap of knowledge exists on: the therapeutic window of TAM, the spatio-temporal mechanisms activated and if this response is sexually dimorphic. We hypothesized that TAM will favor locomotor recovery when administered up-to 24h after SCI in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received a thoracic (T10) contusion using the MACSIS impactor followed by placebo or TAM (15mg/21days) pellets in a therapeutic window of 0, 6, 12, or 24h. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, 28 or 35days post injury (DPI) to study the molecular and cellular changes in the acute and chronic stages. Immediate or delayed therapy (t=6h) improved locomotor function, increased white matter spared tissue, and neuronal survival. TAM reduced reactive gliosis during chronic stages and increased the expression of Olig-2. A significant difference was observed in estrogen receptor alpha between male and female rodents from 2 to 28 DPI suggesting a sexually dimorphic characteristic that could be related to the behavioral differences observed in the therapeutic window of TAM. This study supports the use of TAM in the SCI setting due to its neuroprotective effects but with a significant sexually dimorphic therapeutic window."

Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment. In addition, the effects of Tamoxifen in axonal outgrowth or synapse formation needs to be investigated. This review will address some of the mechanisms activated by Tamoxifen after SCI and the results recently published by investigators in the field."

In this study, the penetrating injury was provoked by a sharp projectile that penetrates through right dorsal and ventral portions of the T13-L1 spinal segments, affecting propriospinal and descending/ascending tracts. Intraperitoneal application of Tamoxifen and a treadmill exercise protocol, as rehabilitation therapies, separately or combined, were used. To evaluate the functional recovery, angular patterns of the hip, knee and ankle joints as well as the leg pendulum-like movement (PLM) were measured during the unrestricted gait of treated and untreated (UT) animals, previously and after the traumatic injury (15 and 30days post-injury (dpi)). A pattern (curve) comparison analysis was made by using a locally designed Matlab script that determines the Frechet dissimilarity. The SCI magnitude was assessed by qualitative and quantitative histological analysis of the injury site 30days after SCI. Our results showed that all treated groups had an improvement in hindlimbs kinematics compared to the UT group, which showed a poor gait locomotion recovery throughout the rehabilitation period. The group with the combined treatment (tamoxifen+exercise (TE)) presented the best outcome. In conclusion, tamoxifen and treadmill exercise treatments are complementary therapies for the functional recovery of gait locomotion in hemi-spinalized rats."

Also, axons myelin sheet was preserved to almost normal values in treated cats. On the contrary, in the untreated animals, their myelin sheet was reduced to 28% at 30 days after injury (DAI), in both the ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the spinal cord.

We provide evidence that tamoxifen (TAM), a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, exerts neuroprotective effects in an animal model when applied up-to 24 h after SCI. We hypothesized that continuous TAM administration will improve functional locomotor recovery by favoring myelin preservation and reducing secondary damage after SCI. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (∼230 g) received a moderate contusion to the thoracic (T9-T10) spinal cord, using the MASCIS impactor device. To determine the therapeutic window available for TAM treatment, rats were implanted with TAM pellets (15 mg) immediately or 24 h after SCI. Locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan open field test, grid walk, and beam crossing tests) was assessed weekly for 35 days post-injury. TAM-treated rats showed significant functional locomotor recovery and improved fine movements when treated immediately or 24 h after SCI. Further, TAM increased white matter preservation and reduced secondary damage caused by astrogliosis, axonal degeneration, and cell death after trauma. These results provide evidence for TAM as a potential therapeutic agent to treat SCI up to 24 h after the trauma."

Many molecular and cellular events are triggered after the initial physical impact to the cord. Two major phases have been described in the field of SCI: an acute phase and late phase. Most of the therapeutic strategies are focused on the late phase because this provides an opportunity to target cellular events like apoptosis, demyelination, scar formation and axonal outgrowth. In this mini-review, we will focus on two agents (tamoxifen and a Src kinase family inhibitor known as PP2) that have been shown in our laboratory to produce neuroprotective (increase cell survival) and/or regenerative (axonal outgrowth) actions. The animal model used in our laboratory is adult female rat (~250 g) with a moderate contusion (12.5 mm) to the spinal cord at the T10 level, using the MASCIS impactor device. Tamoxifen or PP2 was administered by implantation of a 15 mg pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) or by intraperitoneal injections (1.5 mg/kg, every 3 days), respectively, to produce a long-term effect (28 days). Tamoxifen and the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, are drugs that in rats with a moderate spinal cord injury promote functional locomotor recovery, increase spared white matter tissue, and stimulate axonal outgrowth. Moreover, tamoxifen reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, these drugs are possible therapeutic agents that have a neuroprotective/regenerative activity in vertebrates with SCI."

This scar contains reactive astrocytes, activated microglia, macrophages and other myeloid cells, meningeal cells, proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and a dense extracellular matrix. Whether the scar is beneficial or detrimental to recovery remains controversial. In the acute phase of recovery, scar-forming astrocytes limit the invasion of leukocytes and macrophages, but in the subacute and chronic phases of injury the glial scar is a physical and biochemical barrier to axonal regrowth. The signals that initiate the formation of the glial scar are unknown. Both canonical and noncanonical signaling Wnts are increased after spinal cord injury (SCI). Because Wnts are important regulators of OPC and oligodendrocyte development, we examined the role of canonical Wnt signaling in the glial reactions to CNS injury. In adult female mice carrying an OPC-specific conditionally deleted β-catenin gene, there is reduced proliferation of OPCs after SCI, reduced accumulation of activated microglia/macrophages, and reduced astrocyte hypertrophy. Using an infraorbital optic nerve crush injury, we show that reducing β-catenin-dependent signaling in OPCs creates an environment that is permissive to axonal regeneration. Viral-induced expression of Wnt3a in the normal adult mouse spinal cord induces an injury-like response in glia. Thus canonical Wnt signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce injury responses among glial cells. These data suggest that targeting Wnt expression after SCI may have therapeutic potential in promoting axon regeneration."

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-α mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-α antagonist. We also observed that ER-α was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-α. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-α dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen׳s effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition."

To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of TMX for SCI, we used proteomic analyses, Western blots and histological assays, which showed that TMX treatment spared mature oligodendrocytes/increased myelin levels and altered reactive astrocytes, including the upregulation of the water channels aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a novel finding. AQP4 increases in TMX-treated SCI rats were associated with smaller fluid-filled cavities with borders consisting of densely packed AQP4-expressing astrocytes that closely resemble the organization of normal glia limitans externa (in contrast to large cavities in control SCI rats that lacked glia limitans-like borders and contained reactive glial cells). Based on our findings, we propose that TMX is a promising candidate for the therapeutic treatment of SCI and a possible intervention for other neuropathological conditions associated with demyelination and AQP4 dysfunction."

We evaluated the proliferation of glia and the electrocorticogram in the sensorial cortex in a brain injury model. At seven days post-injury, estradiol, tamoxifen and estradiol plus tamoxifen reduced the number of resident and proliferative NG2 and reactive astrocyte vimentin+ cells. Estradiol and tamoxifen effects on NG2 cells could be produced by the classical oestrogen receptors found in these cells. The glial scar was also reduced by tamoxifen. At thirty days post-injury, the amount of resident and proliferative astrocytes increased significantly, except in the estradiol plus tamoxifen group, whilst the oligodendrocytes proliferation in the glial scar was reduced in treated animals. Tamoxifen promotes the survival of FOX-3+ neurons in the injured area and a recovery in the amplitude of electrocorticogram waves. At thirty days, estradiol did not favour the survival of neurons but produced a greater number of reactive astrocytes. In contrast, the number of oligodendrocytes was reduced.

The loss of neuregulin 1 impaired remyelination after nerve crush, but did not affect Schwann cell proliferation associated with Wallerian degeneration or axon regeneration or the clearance of myelin debris by macrophages. Myelination changes were most marked at 10 days after injury but still apparent at 2 months post-crush. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated reduced expression of myelin-related genes during nerve repair in animals lacking neuregulin 1. We also studied repair over a prolonged time course in a more severe injury model, sciatic nerve transection and reanastamosis. In the neuregulin 1 mutant mice, remyelination was again impaired 2 months after nerve transection and reanastamosis. However, by 3 months post-injury axons lacking neuregulin 1 were effectively remyelinated and virtually indistinguishable from control. Neuregulin 1 signalling is therefore an important factor in nerve repair regulating the rate of remyelination and functional recovery at early phases following injury. In contrast to development, however, the determination of myelination fate following nerve injury is not dependent on axonal neuregulin 1 expression. In the early phase following injury, axonal neuregulin 1 therefore promotes nerve repair, but at late stages other signalling pathways appear to compensate."

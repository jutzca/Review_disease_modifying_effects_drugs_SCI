Systemically administered theophylline activates a functionally latent crossed phrenic pathway (CPP) which decussates caudal to the hemisection and activates phrenic motoneurons ipsilateral to the hemisection. The result is return of function to the paralyzed hemidiaphragm. Unfortunately, in humans, systemically administered theophylline at a therapeutic dose produces many unwanted side effects.Design and setting: A tripartite nanoconjugate was synthesized in which theophylline was coupled to a neuronal tracer, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), using gold nanoparticles as the coupler. Following intradiaphragmatic injection of the nanoconjugate, WGA-HRP selectively targets the theophylline-bound nanoconjugate to phrenic motoneurons initially, followed by neurons in the rVRG by retrograde transsynaptic transport.Participants: (N/A)Interventions: (N/A)Outcome Measures: Immunostaining, Electromyography (EMG).Results: Delivery of the theophylline-coupled nanoconjugate to the nuclei involved in respiration induces a return of respiratory activity as detected by EMG of the diaphragm and a modest return of phrenic nerve activity.Conclusion: In addition to the modest return of phrenic nerve activity, there were many difficulties using the theophylline nanoconjugate because of its chemical instability, which suggests that the theophylline nanoconjugate should not be developed for clinical use as explained herein."

Four groups of adult female rats classified as (i) sham (SH) controls, (ii) subjected to a left C2 hemisection (C2H) only, (iii) C2H rats administered theophylline for 3 consecutive days 2 days after C2H (C2H-T day 5) and (iv) C2H rats treated with theophylline for 3 consecutive days 2 days after C2H and then weaned for 12 days (C2H-T day 17) prior to assessment of respiratory function and molecular analysis were employed.

Sham operated and C2H untreated-controls corresponding to C2H-T day 5 and C2H-T day 17 rats, respectively, were prepared similarly. Messenger RNA levels for pro-inflammatory genes (TXNIP, IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS) and neurotrophic and survival factors (BDNF, GDNF, and Bcl2) were analyzed by real time quantitative PCR. Gene expression pattern was unaltered in SH rats. TXNIP, iNOS, BDNF, GDNF and Bcl2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the ipsilateral hemi spinal cord in C2H rats. BDNF, GDNF and Bcl2 levels remained elevated in the ipsilateral hemi spinal cord in C2H-T day 5 rats. In this same group, there was further enhancement in TXNIP and IL-1β while iNOS returned to basal levels. Theophylline increased DNA binding activity of transcription factors - cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) and pro-inflammatory NF-κB.

But another aspect of mitochondrial function is the generation of more than 90% of cellular energy in the form of ATP, mediated by the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) process. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a central OxPhos component and changes in its activity reflect changes in energy demand. A recent study suggests that respiratory muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is compromised via alterations in mitochondrial function. In an animal model of cervical spinal cord hemisection (C2HS) respiratory dysfunction, we have shown that theophylline improves respiratory function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that theophylline improves respiratory function at the cellular level via improved mitochondrial function in the C2HS model. We demonstrate that CcO activity was significantly (33%) increased in the spinal cord adjacent to the site of injury (C3-C5), and that administration of theophylline (20mg/kg 3x daily orally) after C2HS leads to an even more pronounced increase in CcO activity of 62% compared to sham-operated animals. These results are paralleled by a significant increase in cellular ATP levels (51% in the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection). We conclude that C2HS increases energy demand and activates mitochondrial respiration, and that theophylline treatment improves energy levels through activation of the mitochondrial OxPhos process to provide energy for tissue repair and functional recovery after paralysis in the C2HS model."

Cervical SCI often results in a compromised respiratory system. Primary treatment of SCI patients with respiratory insufficiency continues to be with mechanical ventilatory support. In an animal model of SCI, an upper cervical spinal cord hemisection paralyzes the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the side of injury. However, a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore respiratory function after injury. In this review, restoration of respiratory activity following systemic administration of theophylline, a respiratory stimulant will be discussed. Pharmacologically, theophylline is a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a bronchodilator. It has been used in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in treatment of apnea in premature infants. However, the clinical use of theophylline to improve respiration in SCI patients with respiratory deficits is a more recent approach. This review will focus on the use of theophylline to restore respiratory activity in an animal model of SCI. In this model, a C2 hemisection (C2HS) interrupts the major descending respiratory pathways and paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. The review also highlights involvement of central and peripheral adenosine receptors in functional restitution. Biochemical binding assays that highlight changes in adenosine receptors after chronic theophylline administration are discussed as they pertain to understanding adenosine receptor-mediation in functional recovery. Finally, the clinical application of theophylline in SCI patients with respiratory deficits in particular is discussed."

Previous studies have shown that chronic oral administration of theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an adenosine receptor antagonist, can restore function to the quiescent phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to hemisection. Both of these actions of theophylline result in an increase in 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, the chronic theophylline-mediated respiratory recovery persists long after the animals have been weaned from the drug. To date, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the recovery induced by theophylline are still not known. Since theophylline has two modes of action, in the present study we tested whether chronic administration of pentoxifylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 specific inhibitor, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, would induce recovery similar to that induced by theophylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats following a left C2 spinal cord lesion. Recovery of left phrenic nerve activity was assessed at 5 or 10 days after the last drug administrations to assess the persistent nature of the recovery. Pentoxifylline, rolipram and DPCPX, all capable of modulating 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, brought about long-term respiratory recovery in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the left C2 lesion at 5 and 10 days after the last drug administration. Therefore, these results suggest that compounds capable of regulating cAMP levels may be therapeutically useful in promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury."

The purpose of this review is to describe mechanisms that underlie theophylline-induced recovery of respiratory-related function following C2 hemisection and to underscore the therapeutic potential of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline mediates recovery of respiratory-related activity via antagonism of central adenosine A(1) receptors. When administered chronically, the drug restores and maintains recovered function. Since theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist with affinity for both the adenosine A(1) and A(2) receptors, we assessed the relative contributions of each receptor to functional recovery. While A(1) receptor antagonism plays a predominant role, activation of the A(2) receptors by specific agonists subserves the A(1) receptor-mediated actions. That is, when an adenosine A(2) receptor agonist is administered first, it primes the system such that subsequent administration of the A(1) antagonist induces a greater degree of recovered respiratory activity than when the antagonist alone is administered. Chronic oral administration of theophylline in C2 hemisected animals demonstrates that even when animals have been weaned from the drug, theophylline-induced recovered respiratory actions persist. This suggests that in clinical application, it may not be necessary to maintain patients on long-term theophylline. We have shown that recovery of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve can occur spontaneously 3-4 months after C2 hemisection. Theophylline administration after this post-injury period obliterates/negates the recovery function. This indicates strongly that there is therapeutic window (more acutely after injury) for the initiation of theophylline therapy. We have also demonstrated that peripheral (carotid bodies) adenosine A(1) receptors can be selectively activated to modulate theophylline-induced CNS actions. Blocking central adenosine receptors while simultaneously activating peripheral adenosine receptors minimizes the potential of respiratory muscle fatigue with theophylline. The significance of the current findings lies in the potential clinical application of theophylline therapy in spinal cord injured patients with respiratory deficits. The ultimate goal of theophylline therapy is to wean ventilator-dependent patients off ventilatory support. Thus far, our animal studies suggest that the onset of theophylline therapy must be soon after injury."

In this model, an upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemi paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Theophylline restores respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed hemidiaphragm via activation of a latent respiratory motor pathway. Antagonism of central adenosine A1 receptors mediates this action. Theophylline also enhances respiratory frequency, f, defined as breaths per minute. Thus, long-term use may result in respiratory muscle or motoneuron fatigue particularly after spinal cord injury. We assessed the effects of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, N6-p-sulfophenyladenosine (p-SPA) on theophylline's action in our model under standardized recording conditions. Four groups of rats, classified as hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies denervated (H-CBD or NH-CBD), and hemisected/nonhemisected with the carotid bodies intact (H-CBI or NH-CBI ) were used in the study. Eight days after recovery from carotid denervation, a left C2 hemi was performed in H-CBD rats. C2 hemi was also performed in H-CBI animals, and 24 h later, electrophysiologic experiments on respiratory activity were conducted in both groups of animals. Two groups using nonhemisected controls were also employed as described above. In H-CBD rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced respiratory-related activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In NH-CBD rats, theophylline significantly enhanced f. In both H-CBD and NH-CBD rats, p-SPA (0.25 mg/kg) did not significantly change theophylline-induced effects. In H-CBI rats, theophylline significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced f and induced activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve. In H-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced the values to pre-theophylline discharge levels. Recovered activity was not obliterated with the agonist. In NH-CBI rats, p-SPA reduced theophylline-induced effects to pre-drug discharge levels. Adenosine A1 and A2A receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the carotid bodies. The significance of our findings is that theophylline-induced effects can be normalized to pre-drug levels by the selective activation of peripheral adenosine A1 receptors. The therapeutic benefits of theophylline, i.e., recovered respiratory function after paralysis, however, persists. The potential therapeutic impact is that respiratory muscle fatigue associated with long-term theophylline use may be minimized by a novel therapeutic approach."

We also have shown that respiratory recovery occurs spontaneously after prolonged postinjury survival periods when a hemidiaphragm is paralyzed by an ipsilateral upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection. Theophylline mediates functional recovery by central nervous system adenosine A1 receptor antagonism; however, it is unclear whether adenosine receptors are altered after prolonged postinjury periods and whether theophylline can further enhance restored respiratory function that occurs spontaneously. To assess putative effects of systemic theophylline administration on further enhancing spontaneous respiratory muscle recovery 4 months after C2 hemisection in rats and to determine whether adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression is altered in these animals. Electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity in the phrenic nerves was conducted in C2 hemisected rats 4 months after hemisection under standardized conditions. Immediately thereafter, rats were killed and the cervical spinal cords were prepared for adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. Spontaneous recovery of respiratory activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve was detected in a majority (15/20) of C2 hemisected animals and amounted to 44.06% +/- 2.38% when expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral phrenic nerve in noninjured animals. At the optimal dosage used in the acute studies, theophylline (15 mg/kg) did not enhance, but rather unexpectedly blocked, recovered respiratory activity in 4 out of 5 animals tested. At dosages of 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, the drug blocked recovered respiratory activity in 3 out of 4 and 3 out of 5 animals tested, respectively. Quantitative analysis of adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression did not reveal a significant difference between experimental animals and sham-operated animals. The blockade or attenuation of spontaneously recovered respiratory activity following theophylline administration cannot be attributed to changes in adenosine A1 receptors because there were no significant differences in adenosine A1 mRNA expression with sham-operated animals. Lack of alteration in A1 mRNA expression 4 months after cervical SCI suggests that A1 receptor plasticity is not activated by chronic injury. Obliteration of spontaneous recovery with theophylline most likely involves a separate unknown mechanism. These findings suggest that there may be a limited therapeutic window for the clinical application of theophylline in SCI patients with respiratory deficits. Theophylline may be more effective clinically in the acute phase of injury rather than in the chronic phase."

Previous studies from our laboratory have established that a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore function to a hemidiaphragm paralysed by upper cervical (C2) spinal cord hemisection during a reflex known as the 'crossed phrenic phenomenon'. In addition, theophylline, a general adenosine A1 and A2 receptor antagonist, can activate the latent pathway by acting centrally through antagonism at adenosine receptors. 2. The present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in inducing functional recovery in our model of spinal cord injury. Specific adenosine A1 and A2 agonists and antagonists were used in an electrophysiological study. 3. Our results demonstrate that, in hemisected rats, systemic administration of the adenosine A1 receptor-specific antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) restores, in a dose-dependent manner, phrenic nerve respiratory related output that is lost following hemisection. Furthermore, DPCPX augments respiratory activity in non-injured animals. The A2 receptor agonist CGS-21680 mediates its effects by predominantly acting on peripheral rather than central nervous system (CNS) receptors. CGS-21680 modulates respiratory related phrenic nerve activity in non-injured animals by enhancing tonic activity, but does not induce recovery of phrenic nerve activity in hemisected animals in the majority of cases. When CGS-21680 was administered prior to DPCPX in hemisected rats, the magnitude of recovery of respiratory function was significantly greater than that elicited by DPCPX alone. However, when the A2 receptor agonist was administered after DPCPX, the magnitude of recovery was virtually unchanged, whereas activity in the right phrenic nerve was significantly enhanced. The A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine depressed respiratory activity in non-injured, as well as hemisected, rats. The A2 receptor antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine did not affect respiratory activity. 4. We conclude that while antagonism at central adenosine A1 receptors mediates functional restitution in hemisected animals, activation of A2 receptors located outside of the CNS subserves the A1 receptor-mediated respiratory recovery."

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A1 adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase; or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine A1 receptors. Theophylline induced, and maintained, hemidiaphragmatic recovery for prolonged periods after C2 spinal cord hemisection in rats and may prove to be beneficial in assisting respiration in spinal cord injury patients."

The alkylxanthines were selected based on their diverse pharmacologic profiles to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie functional recovery after spinal cord injury. To quantitatively assess the magnitude of recovery, electrophysiological experiments were conducted on pancuronium-paralyzed, hemisected animals under standardized recording conditions. The total absence of respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and paralyzed hemidiaphragm was used as the index of a functionally complete hemisection. Thereafter, drug-induced recovered activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection was quantified and expressed either as a percentage of contralateral phrenic nerve activity in the same animal prior to drug administration or as a percentage of predrug activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals. With either approach, theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced respiratory-related recovered activity. Enprofylline, a potent bronchodilator, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist with limited access to the central nervous system, were ineffective. Maximal recovery was attained with theophylline (15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 mg/kg). At these doses, theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline induced recovery that was 70.0 +/- 2.5 and 69.3 +/- 4.1% of predrug contralateral nerve activity respectively. When expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude changed to 32.9 +/- 4.9 and 35.7 +/- 6.9%, respectively. Involvement of adenosine receptors in the alkylxanthine-induced actions was confirmed in experiments with the adenosine analog, N6 (l-2-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA). It is concluded that central adenosine receptor-mediated mechanisms are implicated in the recovery of respiratory-related activity after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our results suggest a potential for a new therapeutic approach in the rehabilitation of spinal cord patients with respiratory deficits."

Generally, theophylline induced biphasic effects; i.e., at a low dose (15 mg/kg) it evoked excitation, while at a high dose (30 mg/kg) depression of respiratory activity predominated. In group 2 animals, respiratory activity was induced in the nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve for up to 3 h after a single standard dose of theophylline (15 mg/kg). Prior to drug administration, there was an absence of respiratory-related activity in both the phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to C2 spinal cord hemisection. A standard dose of theophylline, however, induced recovery of activity in both the phrenic nerve and the left hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection in group 3 animals. In control (nonhemisected) animals, theophylline enhanced phrenic nerve activity, but decreased the duration of respiratory bursts. These results show for the first time that theophylline can activate latent respiratory motor pathways and thus restore the respiratory drive to phrenic motoneurons lost by spinal cord injury. Respiratory activity is not only reestablished in the phrenic nerve made quiescent by hemisection, but it is also enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve. The drug also restores function to the hemidiaphragm paralyzed by the spinal cord hemisection. The findings may have clinical relevance to human cases of cervical spinal cord injury in which respiratory function is compromised."

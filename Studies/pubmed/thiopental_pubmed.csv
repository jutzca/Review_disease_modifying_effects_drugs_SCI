The influence of anesthetics and hypothermia.",1992,"Annals of surgery","","","",1,"2021-01-14 19:45:00","Comparative Study","10.1097/00000658-199205000-00002","0003-4932","",215,5,409,415,0,0.00,0,5,29,"Infrarenal circumaortic occlusion devices were operatively placed in 74 New Zealand white rabbits. Two days after operation the animals were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups: I, control, n = 23; II, halothane, n = 8; III, thiopental, n = 12; IV, ketamine (30 mg/kg intravenously), n = 6; V, halothane+hypothermia, n = 8; VI, thiopental+hypothermia, n = 12; VII, ketamine+hypothermia, n = 5. In each group, the infrarenal aorta was occluded for 21 minutes. Final neurologic recovery after restitution of blood flow was graded as acute paraplegia, delayed paraplegia (neurologic deficit developing after initial recovery), or normal. Halothane alone was of no benefit. Hypothermia with any anesthetic was completely protective and reduced neurologic deficits to 0% compared with 91% in controls (p less than 0.05). Thiopental and ketamine treatment each reduced acute paraplegia to 17% (as compared with 61% in controls) and increased delayed paraplegia from 30% in controls to 75% and 50%, respectively (p less than 0.05 for thiopental, p = 0.10 for ketamine). The authors interpret the increase in delayed deficits and decrease in acute deficits as being the result of partial spinal cord protection. These findings document that this model of spinal cord ischemia is sufficiently sensitive to identify interventional treatments that protect the ischemic spinal cord."

Hypothermia, thiopental, magnesium, lidocaine, and naloxone were used to pretreat the spinal cord prior to ischemia. Hypothermia and thiopental provided comparable protection: they each increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits in 50% of the animals from 26 to 41 minutes. They also increased from 10 to 30 minutes the time that the postsynaptic waves of the spinal somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) could be absent and the animal still have neurological recovery. Hypothermia and thiopental, when used together, increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits to 57 minutes in 50% of the animals. Naloxone increased the duration of ischemia required to produce neurological deficits to 36 minutes in 50% of the animals, and increased to 20 minutes the time that the postsynaptic waves of the SSEP could be absent and the animal still have neurological recovery. Magnesium pretreatment improved neurological outcome, possibly by improving collateral circulation as the SSEP did not fail completely during aortic occlusion in all animals. Lidocaine was not beneficial, perhaps because of the prolonged hypotension that resulted."

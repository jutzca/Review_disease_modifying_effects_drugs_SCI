We recently discovered that global knock-out of the thrombin receptor, also known as Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1), accelerates myelin development. Here we demonstrate that knocking out PAR1 also promotes myelin regeneration. Outcomes in two unique models of myelin injury and repair, that is lysolecithin or cuprizone-mediated demyelination, showed that PAR1 knock-out in male mice improves replenishment of myelinating cells and remyelinated nerve fibers and slows early axon damage. Improvements in myelin regeneration in PAR1 knock-out mice occurred in tandem with a skewing of reactive astrocyte signatures toward a prorepair phenotype. In cell culture, the promyelinating effects of PAR1 loss of function are consistent with possible direct effects on the myelinating potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in addition to OPC-indirect effects involving enhanced astrocyte expression of promyelinating factors, such as BDNF. These findings highlight previously unrecognized roles of PAR1 in myelin regeneration, including integrated actions across the oligodendrocyte and astroglial compartments that are at least partially mechanistically linked to the powerful BDNF-TrkB neurotrophic signaling system. Altogether, findings suggest PAR1 may be a therapeutically tractable target for demyelinating disorders of the CNS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Replacement of oligodendroglia and myelin regeneration holds tremendous potential to improve function across neurological conditions. Here we demonstrate Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1) is an important regulator of the capacity for myelin regeneration across two experimental murine models of myelin injury. PAR1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor densely expressed in the CNS, however there is limited information regarding its physiological roles in health and disease. Using a combination of PAR1 knock-out mice, oligodendrocyte monocultures and oligodendrocyte-astrocyte cocultures, we demonstrate blocking PAR1 improves myelin production by a mechanism related to effects across glial compartments and linked in part to regulatory actions toward growth factors such as BDNF. These findings set the stage for development of new clinically relevant myelin regeneration strategies."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) may be administered by autologous transplantation, avoiding immunologic challenges. Identifying strategies to optimize iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiNPC) for cell transplantation is an important objective. Herein, we report a method that takes advantage of the growth factor-like and anti-inflammatory activities of the fibrinolysis protease, tissue plasminogen activator tPA, without effects on hemostasis. We demonstrate that conditioning hiNPC with enzymatically-inactive tissue-type plasminogen activator (EI-tPA), prior to grafting into a T3 lesion site in a clinically relevant severe SCI model, significantly improves motor outcomes. EI-tPA-primed hiNPC grafted into lesion sites survived, differentiated, acquired markers of motor neuron maturation, and extended βIII-tubulin-positive axons several spinal segments below the lesion. Importantly, only SCI rats that received EI-tPA primed hiNPC demonstrated significantly improved motor function, without exacerbating pain. When hiNPC were treated with EI-tPA in culture, NMDA-R-dependent cell signaling was initiated, expression of genes associated with stemness (Nestin, Sox2) was regulated, and thrombin-induced cell death was prevented. EI-tPA emerges as a novel agent capable of improving the efficacy of stem cell therapy in SCI."

Exploration of the neuroprotective effect among clinically approved drugs will speed up clinical translation of SCI. Nafamostat mesilate (NM) as a synthetic serine protease inhibitor has been used clinically in pancreatitis treatments. However, its effectiveness in SCI is unknown. The aim of this study was to confirm the efficacy of NM in ameliorating SCI. Intraperitoneal administration of NM was performed on a contusion SCI model in Wistar rat. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining) and Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining were used to observe the histological lesions. Apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining, Annexin V-FITC/PI, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Cytokines and neurotrophins were tested by Western blot. Locomotion recovery assessed by hindlimb BBB score and the inclined plane test. Nafamostat mesilate treatment significantly improved locomotion recovery as assessed by hindlimb BBB scores and the inclined plane test. H&E staining and LFB staining showed a significant increase in spared tissue in both gray matter and white matter. NM decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, apoptosis was also significantly decreased, as shown by TUNEL staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI and by Western blotting for caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expression. Due to the mechanism of action of NM as a serine protease inhibitor, the drug decreased thrombin expression in the damaged spinal cord. Furthermore, NM increased the expression of neurotrophins (NT-3, BDNF, and NGF). Upon NM treatment, the functional and histological outcomes were improved, and microenvironment upon SCI was modulated. As a clinically approved drug, NM holds promise for clinical use after spinal cord injury."

Activated protein C (APC) acts through the same PAR-1 receptor but functions as an anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory protein, which counteracts many of the effects of thrombin. Although the working mechanism of PAR-1 is becoming clear, the functional role of PAR-1 and its correlation with APC in the injured spinal cord remains to be elucidated. Here we investigated if PAR-1 and APC are determinants of long-term functional recovery after a spinal cord contusive injury using PAR-1 null and wild-type mice. We found that neutrophil infiltration and disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier were significantly reduced in spinal cord injured PAR-1 null mice relative to the wild-type group. Both locomotor recovery and ability to descend an inclined grid were significantly improved in the PAR-1 null group 42 days after injury and this improvement was associated with greater long-term sparing of white matter and a reduction in glial scarring. Wild-type mice treated with APC acutely after injury showed a similar level of improved locomotor recovery to that of PAR-1 null mice. However, improvement of APC-treated PAR-1 null mice was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated PAR-1 null mice, suggesting that APC acts through PAR-1. Collectively, our findings define a detrimental role of thrombin-activated PAR-1 in wound healing and further validate APC, also acting through the PAR-1 by biased agonism, as a promising therapeutic target for spinal cord injury."

Here we investigated the role of the PRG family on axonal and filopodia outgrowth. Comparative analysis revealed the strongest outgrowth induced by PRG3 (LPPR1). During development, PRG3 is ubiquitously located at the tip of neuronal processes and at the plasma membrane and declines with age. In utero electroporation of PRG3 induced dendritic protrusions and accelerated spine formations in cortical pyramidal neurons. The neurite growth promoting activity of PRG3 requires RasGRF1 (RasGEF1/Cdc25) mediated downstream signaling. Moreover, in axon collapse assays, PRG3-induced neurites resisted growth inhibitors such as myelin, Nogo-A (Reticulon/RTN-4), thrombin and LPA and impeded the RhoA-Rock-PIP5K induced neurite repulsion. Transgenic adult mice with constitutive PRG3 expression displayed strong axonal sprouting distal to a spinal cord lesion. Moreover, fostered PRG3 expression promoted complex motor-behavioral recovery compared to wild type controls as revealed in the Schnell swim test (SST). Thus, PRG3 emerges as a developmental RasGRF1-dependent conductor of filopodia formation and axonal growth enhancer. PRG3-induced neurites resist brain injury-associated outgrowth inhibitors and contribute to functional recovery after spinal cord lesions. Here, we provide evidence that PRG3 operates as an essential neuronal growth promoter in the nervous system. Maintaining PRG3 expression in aging brain may turn back the developmental clock for neuronal regeneration and plasticity."

In this study we demonstrate that the thrombin receptor (Protease Activated Receptor 1, (PAR1)) serves as a critical translator of the spinal cord injury (SCI) proteolytic microenvironment into a cascade of pro-inflammatory events that contribute to astrogliosis and functional decline. PAR1 knockout mice displayed improved locomotor recovery after SCI and reduced signatures of inflammation and astrogliosis, including expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, and STAT3 signaling. SCI-associated elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 were also reduced in PAR1-/- mice and co-ordinate improvements in tissue sparing and preservation of NeuN-positive ventral horn neurons, and PKCγ corticospinal axons, were observed. PAR1 and its agonist's thrombin and neurosin were expressed by perilesional astrocytes and each agonist increased the production of IL-6 and STAT3 signaling in primary astrocyte cultures in a PAR1-dependent manner. In turn, IL-6-stimulated astrocytes increased expression of PAR1, thrombin, and neurosin, pointing to a model in which PAR1 activation contributes to increased astrogliosis by feedforward- and feedback-signaling dynamics. Collectively, these findings identify the thrombin receptor as a key mediator of inflammation and astrogliosis in the aftermath of SCI that can be targeted to reduce neurodegeneration and improve neurobehavioral recovery."

In this work, thrombin is shown to increase endogenous neural progenitor proliferation in the intact murine spinal cord. A local injection of heparin before a spinal cord injury reduces cell proliferation and astrogliogenesis associated with scarring. We sought to create depot-formulations of PLGA microsphere and Pluronic F-127 for sustained local delivery of two thrombin inhibitors, heparin and hirudin. Each hydrogel depot-formulation showed delayed drug release compared to microspheres or hydrogel alone. Animals with a lateral demyelination lesion showed a reduction in CD68+ macrophages when treated with hirudin-loaded PLGA/F-127 gels compared to control and heparin-treated animals. Moreover, hirudin-loaded materials showed an accelerated recovery in coordinated stepping and increased oligodendrocyte densities. Together, these data demonstrate that controlled delivery of hirudin accelerates functional recovery from a demyelination lesion in the spinal cord."

Control rats (n=9) received transections only. Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed with the BBB scale. Nine weeks post injury, reticulospinal tract axons were traced in 6 rats by injecting BDA into the reticular formation. Transplants grew to fill the lesion cavity in most rats although grafts made with scar tissue removal had large central cavities. Grafts blended extensively with host tissue obliterating the astroglial boundary at the cut ends, but in most cases there was a well-defined partition within the graft that separated rostral and caudal parts of the graft. In some cases, the partition contained non-neuronal scar tissue. There was extensive outgrowth of GFP labeled axons from the graft, but there was minimal ingrowth of host axons into the graft revealed by tract tracing and immunocytochemistry for 5HT. There were no statistically significant differences between transplant and control groups in the degree of locomotor recovery. Our results confirm the previous report that NSC transplants can fill lesion cavities and robustly extend axons, but reveal that most grafts do not create a continuous bridge of neural tissue between rostral and caudal segments."

Although activation of Protein C (PC) has been demonstrated in rats, the efficacy and drug safety of NON activated PC has not been previously tested in experimental SCI. Twelve rats were subjected to 40 g compression of the spinal cord at TH11 for 20 minutes and randomly allocated to either the NON activated PC (25 IU/kg) or the Placebo group (saline).Results. 25 IU treatment yielded improved recovery from SCI compared to placebo and the triple fold dose of PC (75 IU/kg) was subsequently tested to detect treatment associated complications (TAC). Treatment was administered as a single shot via the right vena jugularis forty minutes after onset of compression. The observation period was 5 weeks in 25 IU treated and 1 week in the 75 IU treated rats. Improvement of motor function recovery was measured with behaviour tests and electrophysiology. Single shot treatment with 25 IU/kg of NON activated PC led to improved recovery in terms of behaviour and electrophysiology. TACs neither occurred in the 25 IU nor in the 75 IU group within one week. NON activated PC is a potent and safe drug in experimental SCI and should be considered for treatment in neurotrauma."

In this regard, intravenous activated protein C (aPC) improved neurologic outcomes in a rat compression spinal cord injury (SCI) model. Protein C activation occurs when the serine protease thrombin binds to the cell surface proteoglycan thrombomodulin (TM) forming a complex that halts coagulation. In culture, rTM blocks thrombin's activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), that mediate thrombin killing of neurons and glial reactivity. Both PAR1 and prothrombin are rapidly upregulated after contusion SCI in rats, prior to peak apoptosis. We now report neuroprotective effects of intraperitoneal soluble recombinant human rTM on open-field locomotor rating scale (BBB) and spinal cord lesion volume when given 1 h after SCI. BBB scores from four separate experiments showed a 7.6 +/- 1.4 absolute score increase (p < 0.05) at 3 days, that lasted throughout the time course. Histological sections at 14 days were even more dramatic where a twofold reduction in lesion volume was quantified in rTM-treated rats. Thionin staining revealed significant preservation of motor neuronal profiles both at, and two segments below, the lesion epicenter. Activated caspase-3 immunocytochemistry indicated apoptosis was quite prominent in motor neurons in vehicle (saline) controls, but was dramatically reduced by rTM. Microglia, increased and activated after injury, were reduced with rTM treatment. Taken together, these and previous results support a prominent role for coagulation-inflammation signaling cascades in the subacute changes following SCI. They identify a neuroprotective role for rTM by its inhibition of thrombin generation and blockade of PAR activation."

Lower limb paralysis is a known major risk factor for venous thrombosis, supposedly due to the venostasis in relation with total immobility. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the endothelial response to anoxia to determine whether recovery of fibrinolytic potential occurs in patients subjected to forced bedrest because of a spinal cord injury and whether this recovery is related to the incidence and/or evolution of DVT. We evaluated vascular endothelium reactivity in the lower limbs no longer submitted to the hydrostatic pressure of the erected position in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia and in 10 normal volunteers after venous occlusion produced by the application of 10 cm Hg pressure to the lower limb for 15 min comparatively to the upper limb used as reference. Among the 15 patients, 10 whose spinal cord injury had occurred 1 to 6 months earlier were still receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, whereas the five other patients were not receiving prophylactic anticoagulants because the injury dated back 6 months or more. After venostasis, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) increased significantly in both patients and controls in the upper limb (tPA levels twofold and threefold respectively in controls and patients) but showed no significant changes in the lower limb; prolonged immobility did not allow recovery in the lower limbs of a level of fibrinolytic responsiveness identical to that in the upper limbs. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI1) remained unchanged after anoxia, although wide interindividual variations were seen. Natural coagulation inhibitors and circulating blood stigmates of hypercoagulability were measured. None of the patients had abnormally low levels of coagulation inhibitors (ie, antithrombin III, protein C and protein S levels were normal). Seventy-five per cent of patients (prophylactically anticoagulated or not) had very high levels of fibrin degradation products (D. Dimer levels sevenfold to eightfold those of the controls), but all patients had normal levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragments 1 + 2. The permanence of the thrombotic process characterized by an increase in D. Dimer levels without recovery of fibrinolytic potential suggests a proposal for the patients an indefinite antithrombotic treatment at curative doses."

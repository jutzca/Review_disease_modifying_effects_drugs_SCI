This is despite the fact that individuals with SCI may be at increased risk of peripheral nerve injuries due to wheelchair mobility and baseline sensory deficits. Furthermore, diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury poses a unique challenge in this population because symptoms and signs are superimposed on pre-existing central deficits. We present the case of a 48-year-old man with a C6 AIS A SCI from a motor vehicle accident 22 years earlier who had a new onset compressive radial neuropathy. At initial assessment he complained of paresthesia along his lateral right arm accompanied by new onset wrist-drop. Subsequent radial nerve conduction studies revealed severe reductions in amplitude for sensory and motor action potentials. The patient was managed with mobility exercises and vitamin B supplementation and showed full recovery of motor and sensory function to baseline levels on follow-up 4 months after the injury. The electrophysiologic profile of this patient is illustrative of severe nerve compression for an extended time period. Unlike able-bodied individuals who can reposition themselves to alleviate nerve compression, individuals with SCI may be unaware of nerve compression or unable to reposition themselves. This highlights the need for precautionary measures such as maneuvers and devices to provide trunk and limb stability along with the use of medical alert devices that allow individuals to access timely help when unattended."

Thirty healthy adult male wistar rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group, model group, and mecobalamin group, with 10 rats in each group. A rat model of left sciatic nerve semi-injury was established using forceps. Rats in the mecobalamin group were fed mecobalamin, while rats in the sham-operation group and model group were given the same dose of normal saline. The protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in neurons was measured at 14 days after operation. A semi-quantitative analysis of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins was performed by image analysis technology. The model group had significantly increased Bax protein expression and significantly reduced Bcl-2 protein expression in spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons and ganglion sensory neurons compared with the sham-operation group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group and sham-operation group, the mecobalamin group had significantly reduced Bax protein expression and significantly increased Bcl-2 protein expression in spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons and ganglion sensory neurons (P<0.05). Mecobalamin has anti-apoptotic effect, and it contributes to neurological function recovery possibly by inhibiting the death of injured neurons."

Therefore, providing spinal tissue with an alternative energy substrate during ischemia may be neuroprotective after SCI. To assess this, rats received a mild contusive SCI (120 kdyn, Infinite Horizons impactor) at thoracic level 9 (T9), which causes loss of ∼ 80% of the ascending sensory dorsal column axonal projections to the gracile nucleus. Immediately afterwards, the energy substrate acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC; 1 mg/day) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was infused intrathecally (sub-arachnoid) for 6 days via an L5/6 catheter attached to a subcutaneous Alzet pump. ALC treatment improved overground locomotor function (Basso-Beattie-Breshnahan [BBB] score 18 vs. 13) at 6 days, total spared epicenter (71% vs. 57%) and penumbra white matter (90% vs. 85%), ventral penumbra microvessels (108% vs. 79%), and penumbra motor neurons (42% vs. 15%) at 15 days post-SCI, compared with PBS treatment. However, the ascending sensory projections (anterogradely traced with cholera toxin B from the sciatic nerves) and dorsal column white matter and perfused blood vessels were not protected. Furthermore, grid walking, a task we have shown to be dependent on dorsal column function, was not improved. Thus, mitochondrial substrate replacement may only be efficacious in areas of lesser or temporary ischemia, such as the ventral spinal cord and injury penumbra in this study. The current data also support our previous evidence that microvessel loss is central to secondary tissue degeneration."

Exogenous acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is metabolized in the brain to acetyl coenzyme A and subsequently enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. ALCAR administration is neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury, but has not been tested for TBI. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with ALCAR during the first 24 h following TBI in immature rats improves neurologic outcome and reduces cortical lesion volume. Postnatal day 21-22 male rats were isoflurane anesthetized and used in a controlled cortical impact model of TBI to the left parietal cortex. At 1, 4, 12 and 23 h after injury, rats received ALCAR (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or drug vehicle (normal saline). On days 3-7 after surgery, behavior was assessed using beam walking and novel object recognition tests. On day 7, rats were transcardially perfused and brains were harvested for histological assessment of cortical lesion volume, using stereology. Injured animals displayed a significant increase in foot slips compared to sham-operated rats (6 ± 1 SEM vs. 2 ± 0.2 on day 3 after trauma; n = 7; p < 0.05). The ALCAR-treated rats were not different from shams and had fewer foot slips compared to vehicle-treated animals (2 ± 0.4; n = 7; p< 0.05). The frequency of investigating a novel object for saline-treated TBI animals was reduced compared to shams (45 ± 5% vs. 65 ± 10%; n = 7; p < 0.05), whereas the frequency of investigation for TBI rats treated with ALCAR was not significantly different from that of shams but significantly higher than that of saline-treated TBI rats (68 ± 7; p < 0.05). The left parietal cortical lesion volume, expressed as a percentage of the volume of tissue in the right hemisphere, was significantly smaller in ALCAR-treated than in vehicle-treated TBI rats (14 ± 5% vs. 28 ± 6%; p < 0.05). We conclude that treatment with ALCAR during the first 24 h after TBI improves behavioral outcomes and reduces brain lesion volume in immature rats within the first 7 days after injury."

We hypothesized that folic acid would reduce brain injury and improve neurological outcome in a neonatal piglet model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), using 4 experimental groups of 3- to 5-day-old female piglets. Two groups were intubated, anesthetized and had moderate brain injury induced by rapid axial head rotation without impact. One group of injured (Inj) animals received folic acid (Fol; 80 μg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 15 min following injury, and then daily for 6 days (Inj + Fol; n = 7). The second group of injured animals received an IP injection of saline (Sal) at the same time points (Inj + Sal; n = 8). Two uninjured (Uninj) control groups (Uninj + Fol, n = 8; Uninj + Sal, n = 7) were intubated, anesthetized and received folic acid (80 μg/kg) or saline by IP injection at the same time points as the injured animals following a sham procedure. Animals underwent neurobehavioral and cognitive testing on days 1 and 4 following injury to assess behavior, memory, learning and problem solving. Serum folic acid and homocysteine levels were collected prior to injury and again before euthanasia. The piglets were euthanized 6 days following injury, and their brains were perfusion fixed for histological analysis. Folic acid levels were significantly higher in both Fol groups on day 6. Homocysteine levels were not affected by treatment. On day 1 following injury, the Inj + Fol group showed significantly more exploratory interest, and better motor function, learning and problem solving compared to the Inj + Sal group. Inj + Fol animals had a significantly lower cognitive composite dysfunction score compared to all other groups on day 1. These functional improvements were not seen on day 4 following injury. Axonal injury measured by β-amyloid precursor protein staining 6 days after injury was not affected by treatment. These results suggest that folic acid may enhance early functional recovery in this piglet model of pediatric head injury. This is the first study to describe the application of complex functional testing to assess an intervention outcome in a swine model of TBI."

In order to prove if early metabolic reactivation is a better therapeutic option than antioxidant therapy in the acute phase of TSCI, spinal cord contusions were performed in adult rats using a well-characterized weight drop technique at thoracic 9 level. After TSCI, pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase (NDC) enzyme was used to maintain energy levels, antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and catalase (ANT) were used to decrease oxidative damage and methylprednisolone (MP), which has both therapeutic properties, was used as a control. Rats were divided into one sham group and six with TSCI; one of them received no treatment, and the rest were treated with NDC, MP, NDC + MP, NDC + ANT or ANT. The ANT group decreased lactate and creatine phosphokinase levels and increased the amount of preserved tissue (morphometric analysis) as well as functional recovery (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan or BBB motor scale). In contrast, NDC treatment increased lipid peroxidation, measured through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, as well as spinal cord tissue destruction and functional deficit. Early metabolic reactivation after a TSCI may be deleterious, while natural early metabolic inhibition may not be a ""secondary mechanism of injury"" but a ""secondary neuroprotective response"". While increased antioxidant defence after a TSCI may currently be an ideal therapeutic strategy, the usefulness of metabolic reactivation should be tested in the sub-acute or chronic phases of TSCI and new strategies must continue to be tested for the early ones."

The aim of this study was to probe the effect of metabolic inhibition after an acute traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) using a standardized contusion model (NYU impactor) to know whether the metabolic inhibition is a 'secondary mechanism of injury' or a mechanism of protection. All experimental procedures were carried out in the Mexico City. Animals were divided into five groups: one sham and four with TSCI, including no treatment, rotenone (inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I), sodium azide (inhibitor of mitochondrial complex IV) and pyrophosphate of thiamine or non-degradable cocarboxylase as a metabolic reactivator. After TSCI, the metabolic inhibition with sodium azide treatment diminished the lipid peroxidation process (malondialdehyde levels by spectrophotometric procedures) and the damage to the spinal cord tissue (morphometric analysis), and increased the activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase enzymes (P<0.05) (measured by spectrophotometric procedures 24 h after TSCI as well as after the functional recovery of the hind limb (evaluated weekly for 2 months by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale)) when compared with the TSCI group without treatment. The results show that the partial and transitory inhibition of the aerobic metabolism after an acute TSCI could be a self-protection mechanism instead of being a 'secondary mechanism of injury'."

The objective of this study was to evaluate randomized clinical trials that address potential neuroprotective agents used to improve neurological outcome in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical treatment of acute SCI has evolved significantly, but neurological recovery of severely injured patients remains modest. Neuroprotective agents may act to limit secondary damage in the sequence of pathophysiologic insults that occur after primary SCI. We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines of all clinical randomized trials that evaluated potential neuroprotective agents (drugs, stem cells, and any type of medicative interventions) in neurological outcome of acute SCI. All the studies were graded according to their level of evidence in accordance with the Oxford Level of Evidence-based Medicine. A total of 16 randomized clinical trials were included and fully analyzed in our review. The following 12 substances/drugs were analyzed: methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone, tirilizad, nimodipine, Sygen, autologous incubated macrophages, autologous bone marrow cells, minocycline, erythropoietin, ganglioside, vitamin D, and progesterone. Modest benefits were attributed to minocycline and Sygen (without statistical significance), and some benefits were obtained with erythropoietin and progesterone plus vitamin D in neurological outcome. For MP, the benefits are also controversial and may be attributed to statistical artifacts and with a high risk of adverse effects. The other substances did not change the final outcome. All studies were considered as grade B of recommendation (100%) and levels of evidences as B2 (81.25%) and B3 (18.75%). Our review reported some potential substances that may improve neurological outcome in acute SCI: MP, vitamin D associated with progesterone, and erythropoietin. Their potential benefits were modest in the evaluated studies, requiring further randomized clinical trials with large samples of patients, without statistical artifacts, for routine clinical use. Furthermore, potential adverse effects must be considered with the use of neuroprotective agents in SCI. Until then, the use of these substances may be experimental or restricted to specific clinical situations."

Calcitriol (1 μg/kg) treatment for 7 consecutive days after SCI was compared SCI control and Sham control rat groups. Calcitriol-treated group had significantly improved outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control, which was confirmed by increased ventral horn motor neurons in Calcitriol-treated group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that calcitriol injection has a significant regulatory effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to control SCI groups, which was associated with significant reduction in IFN-γ and IL-17A secretion and leukocyte infiltration into injury site. Along with confirmation of immunoregulatory aspects of Calcitriol treatment against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that reducing the extent of progressive tissue loss by Calcitriol therapy in acute phase, could result in better recovery after SCI."

However, there is limited information regarding the clinical effectiveness of dietary supplements in SCI population. To systematically review the effectiveness of dietary supplements for the prevention or treatment of health-related conditions associated with SCI. Randomized or non-randomized controlled clinical trials were selected, comparing the effect of any dose and form of a dietary supplement (defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act), with either no treatment, placebo, or other medication. Data Sources included the Cochrane Database, DARE, LILACS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, OTSeeker, PEDro, PsycINFO, SpeechBITE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey. Two reviewers independently classified articles from January 1970 through October 2015, and 18 articles were selected. Due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. However, high-quality evidence showed that cranberry supplementation is not effective for prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in SCI. Moderate-quality evidence supported a beneficial effect of vitamin D, alpha-lipoic acid, and omega-3 supplementation, although replication of results is needed. There were conflicting results for the effect of creatine supplementation on improvement of motor outcomes. Low-quality evidence does not permit assessment of the effectiveness of melatonin, whey protein, vitamin C, and Chinese herb in SCI. There is sufficient data suggesting that cranberry supplementation is ineffective for prevention of UTIs in individuals with SCI. There is insufficient data to support or refute the use of any other dietary supplement in individuals with SCI."

The objective of this study is to evaluate the vitamin D profile of patients with SCI and post-stroke hemiplegia. 25(OH)D levels of patients with SCI and hemiplegia were obtained from the electronic medical record database and compared with age- and sex-matched non-disabled controls. Furthermore, the effect of Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) level and Brunnstrom's recovery stage, on vitamin D insufficiency, was studied. The study sample consisted of 173 individuals (118 patients and 55 controls). Vitamin D levels and sufficiency rates of the neurologically disabled patients was significantly lower than that of controls (p= 0.000 and p= 0.000, respectively). However, there was no difference between patients with SCI and hemiplegia regarding the 25(OH)D levels and vitamin D insufficiency (p= 0.303 and p= 0.952, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in vitamin D status by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) level and Brunnstrom's score. However, regression analysis revealed that vitamin D insufficiency rate of non-functionally ambulatory (FAC = 0-2) patients was higher than that of functionally ambulatory (FAC = 3-5) ones (p= 0.044). Vitamin D status of patients with neurological disabilities was lower than that of controls. Non-functionally ambulatory patients had higher vitamin D insufficiency rate than functionally ambulatory patients. Preventative measures including adequate supplementation of vitamin D should be directed to neurologically disabled subjects, particularly those with non-functional ambulation."

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of progesterone and vitamin D on functional outcome of patients with acute traumatic SCI. This was a randomized clinical trial including 64 adult patients with acute traumatic SCI admitted within 8 hours of injury. All the patients received methylprednisolone on admission according to standard protocol (30 mg/kg as bolus dose and 15 mg/kg each 3 hours up to 24 hours). Patients were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular injection of 0.5 mg/kg progesterone twice daily and 5µg/kg oral vitamin D3 twice daily up to 5 days (n = 32) or placebo (n = 32). Patients were visited 6 days, 3 and 6 months after injury and motor and sensory function was assessed according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score. There was no significant difference between two study groups regarding age (P = 0.341), sex (P = 0.802) and therapy lag (P = 0.609). The motor powers and sensory function increased significantly after 6 months in both study groups. Those who received progesterone and vitamin D had significantly higher motor powers and sensory function after 6 months of therapy. Those who received the therapy within 4 hours of injury, had significantly higher motor powers and sensory function 6 months after treatment in progesterone and vitamin D group. Therapy lag was negatively associated with 6-month motor powers and sensory function in progesterone and vitamin D group. Administration of progesterone and vitamin D in acute phase of traumatic SCI is associated with better functional recovery and outcome."

In order to confirm the restorative potential of vitamin D, we performed a new study, using a rat model of left cervical hemisection (C2). From Day 1 or Day 7, animals received, during three months, a weekly oral bolus of either cholecalciferol, at the dose of 500 IU/kg/day, or vehicle, namely triglycerides. Rats were assessed every month, using a ladder test for sensori-locomotor ability and neuromuscular capacity. Three months after injury, H-reflex was recorded from left extensor digitorum muscle in order to measure the reflexivity of the sub-lesional region. Ventilatory frequency was also monitored during an electrically induced muscle fatigue of the hindlimb known to enhance muscle metaboreflex and increase respiratory rate. After recording the phrenic nerve activity, ipsilateral to the lesion, during spontaneous breathing, animals were artificially ventilated while paralyzed with a neuromuscular blocking agent and then the brainstem respiratory centres were provoked to maximal output by temporarily stopping the ventilator. Spinal cords were immunostained with an anti-neurofilament antibody to evaluate axon numbers. We show here that vitamin D-treated animals display i) an enhanced locomotor activity, ii) an improved breathing when hindlimb muscle was electrically stimulated to induce fatigue, iii) an H-reflex depression similar to control animals, iv) a phrenic nerve activity response to a temporary asphyxial stress and v) a non significant decreased number of axons in the proximal stump when compared with the Sham group. This new set of data confirms that vitamin D is a potent molecule that could be tested in clinical trials assessing functional recovery in para-/tetra-plegic patients, shortly after a trauma."

This trial stems from previous studies showing that vitamin D supplementation improves functional recovery in rat models of peripheral or central nerve injury. In a first series of experiments, we used a rat model of peripheral nerve trauma to demonstrate the therapeutic efficiency of vitamin D. We first demonstrated that ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) increases the number and the diameter of newly formed axons and improves the response of metabosensitive fibers from tibialis muscle, in a model of transected peroneal nerve. Then, we compared vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 and observed that the latter is more efficient. At the dose of 500 IU/kg/day, vitamin D3 induces a dramatic functional recovery. We also demonstrated that vitamin D3 increases the number of preserved or newly formed axons in the proximal end, the mean axon diameter in the distal end, neurite myelination in both the distal and proximal ends as well as the expression of genes involved in axogenesis and myelination. In parallel, we assessed the therapeutic role of vitamin D on the central nervous system. In a first study, using a rat model of spinal cord compression at the T10 thoracic level, we delivered vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) orally at the dose of 50 IU/kg/day or 200 IU/kg/day. When compared to control animals, vitamin D-treated rats displayed, three months after injury, a significant improvement of ventilatory frequency and a reduction of H reflex indicating functional improvements at three months post-injury. In a second study, we used a rat model of cervical hemisection (C2) with a higher dose of oral vitamin D3 (500 IU/kg/day) delivered weekly, during 12 weeks. We observed an improved locomotor recovery, a reduced spasticity and a significantly higher rate of axons crossing the lesion site in treated animals. However, it must be pointed out that the functional improvement is reduced when vitamin D is provided one week after the trauma."

However, before bringing this molecule to the clinic, it was of prime importance i) to assess which form - ergocalciferol versus cholecalciferol - and which dose were the most efficient and ii) to identify the molecular pathways activated by this pleiotropic molecule. The rat left peroneal nerve was cut out on a length of 10 mm and autografted in an inverted position. Animals were treated with either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, at the dose of 100 or 500 IU/kg/day, or excipient (Vehicle), and compared to unlesioned rats (Control). Functional recovery of hindlimb was measured weekly, during 12 weeks, using the peroneal functional index. Ventilatory, motor and sensitive responses of the regenerated axons were recorded and histological analysis was performed. In parallel, to identify the genes regulated by vitamin D in dorsal root ganglia and/or Schwann cells, we performed an in vitro transcriptome study. We observed that cholecalciferol is more efficient than ergocalciferol and, when delivered at a high dose (500 IU/kg/day), cholecalciferol induces a significant locomotor and electrophysiological recovery. We also demonstrated that cholecalciferol increases i) the number of preserved or newly formed axons in the proximal end, ii) the mean axon diameter in the distal end, and iii) neurite myelination in both distal and proximal ends. Finally, we found a modified expression of several genes involved in axogenesis and myelination, after 24 hours of vitamin supplementation. Our study is the first to demonstrate that vitamin D acts on myelination via the activation of several myelin-associated genes. It paves the way for future randomised controlled clinical trials for peripheral nerve or spinal cord repair."

However, higher levels of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 were indicated after cAMP treatment. Meanwhile, more apoptotic cells were observed in the SCI rats, as evidenced by TUNEL staining and increased expression of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase12. In contrast, the expression of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase12 was decreased in SCI rats after cAMP treatment. In summary, we showed novel data that cAMP reduced cell apoptosis and functional recover after SCI mainly via activating UPR."

So, we aimed to test the effect of treatment with miR-139-5p on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in mice with SCI and investigate the underlying mechanism. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-139-5p directly targeted mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), and miR-139-5p treatment suppressed Mst1 protein expression in damaged spinal cords of mice. Wild-type mice and Mst1(-/-) mice were exposed to SCI and treated with miR-139-5p agomir via intrathecal infusion. Treatment of SCI mice with miR-139-5p accelerated locomotor functional recovery, reduced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulations, and promoted neuronal survival in damaged spinal cords. Treatment with miR-139-5p enhanced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha), improved mitochondrial function, and suppressed NF-kappa B-related inflammation in damaged spinal cords. Deficiency of Mst1 had similar benefits in mice with SCI. Furthermore, miR-139-5p treatment did not provide further protection in Mst1(-/-) mice against SCI. In conclusion, miR-139-5p treatment enhanced functional recovery and reduced pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through targeting Mst1."

Although functional recovery requires rearrangement of the injured neural network, adult CNS does not spontaneously regenerate after injury, at least partly because of the effect of inhibitory factors and weak intrinsic ability of the CNS to regenerate. Molecular mechanisms that prevent CNS regeneration have been investigated extensively. Proteins that are derived from myelin, derived from reactive astrocytes, and involved in repulsive axon guidance during the developmental stages have been identified as inhibitory factors for axon regeneration. Changes in the expression levels of intracellular signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate lead to changes in the intrinsic regenerative potential of neurons. Suppression of these inhibitory factors promotes functional recovery after CNS injury, presumably due to axon growth. Therefore, targeting these molecules could represent a powerful strategy for the treatment of patients with CNS injury."

In Chinese traditional medicine, the agonist of a purinergic receptor is believed to have a positive effect on SCIs, and 2-Methylthio-adenosine-5 ' -diphosphate (2-MesADP) is a selective agonist of the P2Y purinergic receptor. Methods: To investigate its therapeutic function and molecular mechanism in SCI, transcriptome analysis associated with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out at various time points after T9 crush injury. Results: 2-MesADP demonstrated recovery of limb motor function at the 6 weeks after injury, accompanied by neuronal regeneration and axon remyelination at 2 and 6 weeks. Furthermore, gene profiling revealed alternated gene expression with the treatment of 2-MesADP. These genes were assigned to a total of 38 modules, followed by gene ontology analysis; of these, 18 represented neuronal apoptosis and regeneration, immune response, synaptic transmission, cell cycle, and angiogenesis. In the neuronal apoptosis and regeneration module, Nefh, NeuroD6, and Dcx in the 2-MesADP group were noticed due to their interesting expression pattern. The gene expression patterns of Mag, Mog, and Cnp, which played key roles in myelination, were significantly changed with the treatment of 2-MesADP. Wnt signal pathway was the most important pathway in 2-MesADP treatment for acute SCI. Conclusion: 2-MesADP enhanced locomotor recovery in mouse SCI by altering the expression of neuronal apoptosis and remyelination-related genes and Wnt signaling pathways."

However, both preclinical and clinical studies indicate the capacity of electrical and pharmacological interventions to synergistically increase the engagement of spinal sensorimotor networks and regain motor function after SCI. This study explored whether selective pharmacological antagonism of the adenosine A1 receptor subtype synergizes with ESS, thereby increasing motor response. We hypothesized that selective pharmacological antagonism of A1 receptors during ESS would produce facilitatory effects in spinal sensorimotor networks detected as an increased amplitude of spinally-evoked motor potentials and sustained duration of ESS induced activity. Terminal experiments were performed in adult rats using trains of stereotyped pulses at 40 Hz delivered at L5 with the local administration to the cord of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). We demonstrated that ESS combined with the blockage of A1 receptors increased the magnitude of the endogenous modulation and postponed the decay of responses that occur during ESS alone. Although DPCPX significantly increased the yield of repetitive stimulation in intact spinal cords, the effects of A1 antagonism on motor evoked responses after an acute spinal transection was not detected. These studies support the future investigation of the optimal dosage, methods of delivery, and systemic effects of the synergistic application of A1 antagonists and spinal stimulation in the intact and injured spinal cord."

So far, there is no satisfactory treatment for SCI, because of its complex and ill-defined pathophysiology. Recently, autophagy has been implicated as protective in acute SCI rat models. Here, we investigated the therapeutic value of a dietary intervention, namely, intermittent fasting (IF), on neuronal survival after acute SCI in rats, and its underlying mechanism related to autophagy regulation. We found remarkable improvement in both behavioral performance and neuronal survival at the injured segment of the spinal cord of animals previously subjected to IF. Western blotting revealed a marked decrease in apoptosis-related markers such as cleaved caspase 3 levels and the bax/bcl-2 ratio in the IF group, which suggested an inhibition of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. In addition, the expression of the autophagy markers LC3-II and beclin 1 was also increased in the IF group compared with ad libitum fed animals. In parallel, IF decreased the levels of the substrate protein of autophagy, p62, indicative of an upregulation of the autophagic processes. Treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a selective inhibitor of autophagy, reversed the downregulated apoptosis-related markers by IF. Finally, IF could activate the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and enhance lysosome function by upregulating transcription factor (TF)EB expression. Altogether, the present findings suggest that IF exerts a neuroprotective effect after acute SCI via the upregulation of autophagy, and further points to dietary interventions as a promising combinatorial treatment for SCI."

The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of dBcAMP on learning, memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in the excitotoxically lesioned hippocampus. An excitotoxic lesion was induced in the hippocampi of 4-month-old male BALB/c mice by injecting 0.25 mu g/mu l into the lateral ventricles of both sides. The lesioned mice (L) were divided into L+dBcAMP and L+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) groups. Sham surgery (S) was done by the injection of 1 mu l of sterile saline into the lateral ventricles. The sham surgery mice were divided into S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups. Mice in the L+dBcAMP and S+dBcAMP groups were treated with dBcAMP for 1 week (i.p., 50 mg/kg), whereas mice in the L+PBS and S+PBS groups were treated with PBS. The mice in all groups were subjected to water maze and passive avoidance tests at the end of the 4th week. Cresyl violet staining and NeuN and doublecortin immunostaining were done to analyze the morphology and neurogenesis. The water maze learning sessions did not show a significant difference in escape latency between the groups, suggesting an unimpaired learning ability of mice in all groups. The L+dBcAMP mice had significantly short entry latency and higher target quadrant time/distance traveled compared to the L+PBS group, suggesting better memory retention. The L+dBcAMP group had a significantly improved memory retention compared to the L+PBS mice during the passive avoidance test. Morphological studies showed significantly greater adult neurons and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice in the L+dBcAMP group compared to those in the L+PBS group. There was no significant difference between the S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups in the water maze/passive avoidance tests and the number of neurons. In conclusion, dBcAMP protects the hippocampal neuron from degeneration and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, learning, and memory."

We hypothesized that SCI induced via left hemisection of the second cervical segment (C2Hx) results in SDB. We further hypothesized that blockade of adenosine A1 receptors following C2Hx would reduce the severity of SDB. In the first experiment, adult male rats underwent left C2Hx or sham (laminectomy) surgery. Unrestrained whole body plethysmography (WBP) and implanted wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) were used for assessment of breathing during spontaneous sleep and for the scoring of respiratory events at the acute (similar to 1 wk), and chronic (similar to 6 wk) time points following C2Hx. During the second experiment, the effect of oral administration of adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 3 times a day for 4 days) on SCI induced SDB was assessed. C2Hx animals exhibited a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) compared with the sham group, respectively (35.5 +/- 12.6 vs. 19.1 +/- 2.1 events/h, P < 0.001). AHI was elevated 6 wk following C2Hx (week 6, 32.0 +/- 5.0 vs. week 1, 42.6 +/- 11.8 events/h, respectively, P = 0.12). In contrast to placebo, oral administration of DPCPX significantly decreased AHI 4 days after the treatment (159.8 +/- 26.7 vs. 69.5 +/- 8.9%, P < 0.05). Cervical SCI is associated with the development of SDB in spontaneously breathing rats. Adenosine A1 blockade can serve as a therapeutic target for SDB induced by SCI."

Damage to the spinal cord leads to a series of detrimental events including ischaemia, haemorrhage and neuroinflammation, which over time result in further neural tissue loss. Eventually, at chronic stages of traumatic spinal cord injury, the formation of a glial scar, cystic cavitation and the presence of numerous inhibitory molecules act as physical and chemical barriers to axonal regrowth. This is further hindered by a lack of intrinsic regrowth ability of adult neurons in the central nervous system. The intracellular signalling molecule, cyclic adenosine 3 ',5 '-monophosphate (cAMP), is known to play many important roles in the central nervous system, and elevating its levels as shown to improve axonal regeneration outcomes following traumatic spinal cord injury in animal models. However, therapies directly targeting cAMP have not found their way into the clinic, as cAMP is ubiquitously present in all cell types and its manipulation may have additional deleterious effects. A downstream effector of cAMP, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2), is mainly expressed in the adult central nervous system, and its activation has been shown to mediate the positive effects of cAMP on axonal guidance and regeneration. Recently, using ex vivo modelling of traumatic spinal cord injury, Epac2 activation was found to profoundly modulate the post-lesion environment, such as decreasing the activation of astrocytes and microglia. Pilot data with Epac2 activation also suggested functional improvement assessed by in vivo models of traumatic spinal cord injury. Therefore, targeting Epac2 in traumatic spinal cord injury could represent a novel strategy in traumatic spinal cord injury repair, and future work is needed to fully establish its therapeutic potential."

The investigation was intended to elucidate whether SPT can exert neuroprotective effect by triggering neuronal autophagy after SCI. The study was also directed to investigate the role of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the autophagy facilitated by SPT. Materials and Methods: The SCI was developed in female Sprague-Dawley rats by damaging the T10 spinal level using an impounder impact. Three animals groups were investigated - Sham group, SCI group, and SCI + SPT group. The SCI + SPT group was administered with SPT (100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores and angle of incline test revealed that SPT administration improved the movement of hind limbs after SCI induction. Results: Results indicated that SPT imparted neuronal protection, alleviated neuronal apoptosis, and improved neuronal autophagy. SPT-induced autophagy was identified by increased Beclin-1 expression and LC3B-positive neuronal cells. Further investigations revealed that SPT triggers the pathway involving AMPK/mTOR signaling, thereby stimulating autophagy in SCI-induced rat model. Conclusion: The findings of the present investigation strongly advocate the beneficial effects of SPT in the treatment of the SCI. SPT ameliorates the AMPK/mTOR signaling-induced autophagy and thereby improves functional recovery in SCI-induced rats."

Here we summarize our studies evaluating the role of purine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in early AMD as well as photoreceptor loss and have also provided some insights to our investigations of a new laser treatment for those with early AMD. One of the receptors that are activated by ATP, P2X7, is expressed by neurons and immune cells and has a different function in each cell type. In neurons, P2X7 receptors forma ligand-gated ion channel, whereas on immune cells P2X7 receptors act as a scavenger receptor. These distinct functions have provided new insights to the mechanisms of AMD. On the one hand, high concentrations of ATP can cause photoreceptor death, most likely via stimulation of P2X7 receptors localized on photoreceptor terminals. On the other hand, P2X7 receptors mediate removal of dead and dying cells by monocytes. By understanding the fundamental cell biological changes that occur in patients and animal models of disease, we have uncovered mechanisms that may help us manage and treat patients in the future.

A close correlation between the duration of ischaemia and the interstitial concentration of adenosine and 5-HT was not found. Repetition of ischaemic periods in an experiment did not lead to an extracellular accumulation or an exhaustion of the release of 5-HT, whereas some indication was found for an exhaustion of adenosine release.

Expression of GFAP and BDNF levels in the tissue were estimated by Western blotting and ELISA respectively. The results showed a gradual increase in the number of both astrocytes and microglia in both injuries with a significant increase in dBcAMP-treated groups. The number of degenerating neurons significantly decreased in dBcAMP treated groups. In addition, it was found that dBcAMP stimulated the expression of GFAP and BDNF in both stab wound and kainic acid injuries. Treatment with BDNF receptor inhibitor AZ-23, showed an increase in the degenerating neurons suggesting the role of BDNF in neuroprotection. This study indicates that dBcAMP protects neurons from degeneration by enhancing the production of BDNF and may be considered for use as therapeutic agent for treatment of brain injuries."

When administered at 60 min post-CGS-21680, MK-801 prevented further increases in phrenic nerve activity compared with the CGS-21680 alone (CGS-21680 alone at 120 min: 114 +/- 19%; CGS-21680 and MK-801 at 60 min post-CGS-21680: 61 +/- 11%, above baseline, P < 0.05) but did not return phrenic motor output to baseline values. Our data suggest that NMDA receptor activation is necessary for de novo A2a receptor-mediated phrenic motor facilitation and that the maintenance of preexisting phrenic motor facilitation does not involve NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms."

Recent studies have shown that LLLT can biomodulate processes in the central nervous system and has been extensively studied as a stroke treatment. However there is still a lack of knowledge on the effects of LLLT at the cellular level in neurons. The present study aimed to study the effect of 810 nm laser on several cellular processes in primary cortical neurons cultured from mouse embryonic brains. Neurons were irradiated with light dose of 0.03, 0.3, 3, 10 and 30 J/cm(2) and intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and calcium were measured. The changes in mitochondrial function in response to light were studied in terms of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Light induced a significant increase in calcium, ATP and MMP at lower fluences and a decrease at higher fluence. ROS was induced significantly by light at all light doses. Nitric oxide levels also showed an increase on treatment with light. The results of the present study suggest that LLLT at lower fluences is capable of inducing mediators of cell signaling process which in turn may be responsible for the biomodulatory effects of the low level laser. At higher fluences beneficial mediators are reduced but potentially harmful mediators are increased thus offering an explanation for the biphasic dose response."

We have characterized the ependymal cell response to injury in this model system and found that ependymal cells can become activated, proliferate, migrate out of the central canal lining and differentiate in a manner resembling the in vivo situation. Moreover, we show that these cells respond to external adenosine triphosphate and exhibit spontaneous Ca2+ activity, processes that may play a significant role in the regulation of their response to spinal cord injury. This model provides an attractive tool to deepen our understanding of the ependymal cell response after spinal cord injury, which may contribute to the development of new treatment options for spinal cord injury."

RNA sequencing revealed that changes in the expression of genes that control axonal guidance could be a key factor determining the serotonin effects during regeneration.

Conditions that allow axon growth by axotomized and cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on CNS myelin include immaturity (the first few postnatal days), high levels of cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP), and conditioning with a peripheral nerve lesion before explant.

Anticholinergic agents are the mainstay for medical treatment of detrusor overactivity. However, their use is limited by significant side effects such that a search for new treatments is warranted. Inosine is a naturally occurring purine nucleoside with neuroprotective, neurotrophic and antioxidant effects that is known to improve motor function in preclinical models of SCI. However, its effect on lower urinary tract function has not been determined. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of systemic administration of inosine on voiding function following SCI and to delineate potential mechanisms of action. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent complete spinal cord transection, or cord compression by application of an aneurysm clip at T8 for 30 sec. Inosine (225 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered daily via intraperitoneal injection either immediately after injury or after a delay of 8 wk. At the end of treatment, voiding behavior was assessed by cystometry. Levels of synaptophysin (SYP), neurofilament 200 (NF200) and TRPV1 in bladder tissues were measured by immunofluorescence imaging. Inosine administration decreased overactivity in both SCI models, with a significant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous non-voiding contractions during filling, compared to vehicle-treated SCI rats (p<0.05), including under conditions of delayed treatment. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated increased levels of the pan-neuronal marker SYP and the Adelta fiber marker NF200, but decreased staining for the C-fiber marker, TRPV1 in bladder tissues from inosine-treated rats compared to those from vehicle-treated animals, including after delayed treatment. These findings demonstrate that inosine prevents the development of detrusor overactivity and attenuates existing overactivity following SCI, and may achieve its effects through modulation of sensory neurotransmission."

The ventilatory behavior in response to mild acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (10 episodes of 5 min of hypoxia [10% O-2, 4% CO2, 86% N-2] with 5 min of normoxia intervals) was measured by whole-body plethysmography at the acute (similar to 3 days), subchronic (similar to 2 weeks), and chronic (similar to 8 weeks) injury stages. The minute ventilation of contused animals is significantly enhanced following acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia due to an augmentation of the tidal volume at all time-points post-injury. However, acute intermittent hypercapnia-hypoxia-induced ventilatory long-term facilitation was only observed in uninjured animals at the acute stage. During the second experiment, the effect of acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia on respiration was examined in contused animals after a blockade of serotonin receptors, or adenosine 2A receptors. The results demonstrated that acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia-induced enhancement of minute ventilation was attenuated by a serotonin receptor antagonist (methysergide) but enhanced by an adenosine 2A receptor antagonist (KW6002) at the subchronic and chronic injury stages. These results suggested that acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia can induce respiratory recovery from acute to chronic injury stages. The therapeutic effectiveness of intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia is dampened by the inhibition of serotonin receptors, but a blockade of adenosine 2A receptors enhanced respiratory recovery induced by intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia."

Hind limb motor function was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale at 1 week and 4 weeks after the SCI. Spinal cord segments were collected after final behavior evaluation for morphological analysis. The tissue sparing was evaluated by luxol fast blue staining. Immunofluorescence stain was employed to assess astrocyte activation and neurofilament positioning, while microglia activation was examined by immunohistochemistry stain. The results showed that spontaneous functional recovery was blocked after the animals were subjected caffeine daily. Moreover, caffeine administration increased the demyelination area, promoted astrocyte and microglia activation and decreased the quantity of neurofilaments. These findings suggest that the neurotoxicity effect of caffeine may be associated with the inhibition of neural repair and the promotion of neuroinflammation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Mice were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, ICA 20 mu mol/kg (low dose) and ICA 50 mu mol/kg (high dose) groups. And Behavioral, biochemical, molecular biological, immunofluorescent and histological assays were performed.

Furthermore, ICA decreased the expression of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins at 3 days after SCI. More importantly, transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Nissl staining implied that ICA at a high dose inhibited the neuronal apoptosis after SCI.

Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the main cell for remyelination and are derived from the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). To date, it has been unclear whether the differentiation of OPCs can be regulated by OFS. The goal of this study was to determine if OFS can improve the differentiation of OPCs and promote the recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats. Immature and mature OLs were observed in spinal cord slices through immunofluorescence staining. Levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Basso-Beattie-Bres nahan (BBB) scores and transcranial magnetic motorevoked potentials (tcMMEPs) were used to evaluate the locomotor outcomes of rats after SCI. Our results showed a significant improvement in the differentiation of OPCs and the content of ATP and LIF in the injured spinal cord in the OFS group. Furthermore, BBB scores and tcMMEPs were significantly improved in the rats stimulated by OFS. These findings suggest that OFS can improve the differentiation of OPCs and promote the recovery of neurological function following SCI in rats. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A conditioning sciatic nerve crush (SNC) preceding spinal cord injury stimulates central sensory axon regeneration via the intraganglionic action of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Here, using bromodeoxyuridine, mitomycin (mitosis inhibitor), and cholera toxin B tracer, we demonstrate that SNC-induced division of spinal glia is related to the spinal induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and contributes to central sensory axon growth into the damaged spinal cord. Dividing cells were mainly NG2-positive and Iba1-positive and included myeloid NG2-positive populations. The cells dividing in response to SNC mainly matured into oligodendrocytes and microglia within the injured spinal cord. Some postmitotic cells remained NG2-reactive and were associated with regenerating fibers. Moreover, intraganglionic tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression was induced after administration of SNC or cyclic adenosine monophosphate analog (dbcAMP) to dorsal root ganglia in vivo and in primary adult dorsal root ganglia cultures. Collectively, these findings support a novel model whereby a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-activated regeneration program induced in sensory neurons by a conditioning peripheral nerve lesion uses tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 to protect against short-term proteolysis, enabling glial cell division and promoting axon growth into the damaged CNS."

Loss of mitochondrial homeostasis after SCI, mediated primarily by oxidative stress, is considered to play a crucial role in the proliferation of secondary injury cascade. We hypothesized that effective exogenous delivery of antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), encapsulated in biodegradable nanoparticles (nano-SOD/CAT) - at the lesion site would protect mitochondria from oxidative stress, and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury. Previously, in a rat contusion model of severe SCI, we demonstrated extravasation and retention of intravenously administered nanoparticles specifically at the lesion site. To test our hypothesis, a single dose of nano-SOD/CAT in saline was administered intravenously 6 h post-injury, and the spinal cords were analyzed one week post-treatment. Mitochondria isolated from the affected region of the spinal cord of nano-SOD/CAT-treated animals demonstrated significantly reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) activities, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced calcium levels, and also higher adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production capacity than those isolated from the spinal cords of untreated control or SOD/CAT solution treated animals. Although the treatment did not achieve the same mitochondrial function as in the spinal cords of sham control animals, it significantly attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction following SCI. Further, immunohistochemical analyses of the spinal cords of treated animals showed significantly lower ROS, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c activities, leading to reduced spinal cord neuronal cell apoptosis and smaller lesion area than in untreated animals. These results imply that the treatment significantly attenuated progression of secondary injury that was also reflected from less weight loss and improved locomotive recovery of treated vs. untreated animals. In conclusion, nano-SOD/CAT mitigated activation of cascade of degenerating factors by protecting mitochondria and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury. An effective treatment during the acute phase following SCI could potentially have a positive long-term impact on neurological and functional recovery."

Subsequent changes in cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PICA) and PICA-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor ""cAMP response element-binding protein"" (CREB) are also analyzed. Rats with moderate weight-drop injury at segment T8 received 2 h of NRM stimulation beginning three days after injury, followed immediately by separate extraction of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord for immunochemical assay. Controls lacked injury, stimulation or both. Injury reduced cAMP levels to under half of normal in all three spinal regions. NRM stimulation completely restored these levels, while producing no significant change in non-injured rats. Pretreatment with the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist pimozide (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) lowered cAMP in non-injured rats to injury amounts, which were unchanged by NRM stimulation. The phosphorylated fraction of PICA (pPKA) and CREB (pCREB) was reduced significantly in all three regions after SCI and restored by NRM stimulation, except for pCREB in lumbar segments. In conclusion, SCI produces spreading deficits in cAMP, pPKA and pCREB that are reversible by Gs protein-coupled 5-HT receptors responding to raphe-spinal activity, although these signaling molecules are not reactive to NRM stimulation in normal tissue. These findings can partly explain the benefits of NRM stimulation after SCI. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death."

Spinal trauma was induced by extradural compression of spinal cord at T5-T8 level in C57BL6/J mice. Animals were randomly assigned to the following groups: Sham (n = 10), SCI (n = 14), SCI C PDRN (8 mg/kg/i. p.; n = 14), SCI C PDRN C DMPX (8 and 10 mg/kg/i. p., respectively; n = 14).

PDRN systemically administered 1 h following SCI, protected from tissue damage, demyelination, and reduced motor deficits evaluated after 10 days. PDRN also reduced the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, reduced BAX expression and preserved Bcl-2. Furthermore, PDRN stimulated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and decreased apoptotic process 24 h following SCI, whereas DMPX administration prevented PDRN effects on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the relevant A(2A) receptors for pMF are expressed in phrenic motor neurons per se versus non-phrenic neurons of the cervical spinal cord. A(2A) receptor immunostaining significantly colocalized with NeuN-positive neurons (892%). Intrapleural siRNA injections were used to selectively knock down A(2A) receptors in cholera toxin B-subunit-labelled phrenic motor neurons. A(2A) receptor knock-down was verified by a approximate to 45% decrease in A(2A) receptor immunoreactivity within phrenic motor neurons versus non-targeting siRNAs (siNT; P<0.05). There was no evidence for knock-down in cervical non-phrenic motor neurons. In rats that were anaesthetized, subjected to neuromuscular blockade and ventilated, pMF induced by cervical (C3-4) intrathecal injections of the A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 was greatly attenuated in siA(2A) (21%) versus siNT treated rats (147%; P<0.01). There were no significant effects of siA(2A) on phrenic burst frequency. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that phrenic motor neurons express the A(2A) receptors relevant to A(2A) receptor-induced pMF."

Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings we evaluated the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons in female rats at the L6/S1 level when urinary bladder pressure was abruptly increased. Intravesical infusion of ATP and systemic application of suramin allowed us to evaluate the contribution of urothelial purinergic receptors. Rats were anesthetized with isofluorane. Suprapubic, venous and tracheal catheters were implanted. Laminectomy was performed at the L6-51 spinal levels. The cervical spinal cord was transected, and rats were mechanically pithed. Anesthesia was stopped, rats were ventilated, and a muscle relaxant was administered. The frequency of spinal neural activity was recorded via tungsten electrodes inserted into the dorsal horn at the L6-S1 level. The signal was amplified, filtered and recorded with a data acquisition system at 10 kHz sampling rate. Vital signs as well as bladder pressure were monitored in real time. We evaluated field potentials during intravesical pressure steps ranging from 0 to 60 cm H2O in (A) control (saline in the bladder), (B) after stimulation of urothelial purinergic receptors (1 mM vesical ATP), and (C) after the intravenous application of the non-specific purinergic antagonist suramin (100 mg/kg). Pressure steps were maintained for 1 min followed by 3 min for recovery. Only neurons that showed an increased activity during bladder distention were evaluated. Under control conditions, the generation of field potentials increased concomitantly with bladder pressure steps, showing an activity change threshold between 20 and 40 cm H2O. Intravesical application of 1 mM ATP produced an increase in baseline activity, indicative of noxious stimulation, and spinal neuronal activity markedly increased above 40 cm H2O pressure. Systemic suramin prevented the increase in neural activity in response to pressure changes, even after intravesical ATP. These results suggest that urothelial purinergic receptors are important modulators of lumbosacral dorsal spinal neuronal activity. The inhibitory effects of suramin imply that enhanced lumbosacral neuronal signals result from activation of C-fibers during noxious bladder stimulation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc."

Phosphokinase A (PKA) is a prominent downstream target of cAMP that has been associated with neurite outgrowth. We hypothesized that rehabilitative motor training following spinal cord injuries promotes neuroplasticity via PKA activation. However, in two independent experiments, inhibition of cortical PKA using Rp-cAMPS throughout rehabilitative training robustly increased functional recovery and collateral sprouting of injured corticospinal tract axons, an indicator of neuroplasticity. Consistent with these in vivo findings, using cultured STHdh neurons, we found that Rp-cAMPS had no effect on the phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), a prominent downstream target of PKA, even with the concomitant application of the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin to increase cAMP levels. Conversely, when cAMP levels were increased using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, Rp-cAMPS potently inhibited CREB phosphorylation. Taken together, our results suggest that an alternate cAMP dependent pathway was involved in increasing CREB phosphorylation and neuroplasticity. This idea was supported by an in vitro neurite outgrowth assay, where inhibiting PKA did enhance neurite outgrowth. However, when PKA inhibition was combined with inhibition of EPAC2 (exchange protein directly activated by CAMP), another downstream target of CAMP in neurons, neurite outgrowth was significantly reduced."

Multiple mechanisms of motor neuron injury have been implicated, including more than 20 different genetic factors. The pathogenesis of ALS consists of two stages: an early neuroprotective stage and a later neurotoxic. During early phases of disease progression, the immune system through glial and T cell activities provides anti-inflammatory factors that sustain motor neuron viability. As the disease progresses and motor neuron injury accelerates, a rapidly succeeding neurotoxic phase develops. A well-orchestrated purine-mediated dialog among motor neurons, surrounding glia and immune cells control the beneficial and detrimental activities occurring in the nervous system. In general, low adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations protect cells against excitotoxic stimuli through purinergic P2X4 receptor, whereas high concentrations of ATP trigger toxic P2X7 receptor activation. Finally, adenosine is also involved in ALS progression since A2A receptor antagonists prevent motor neuron death. Given the complex cellular cross-talk occurring in ALS and the recognized function of extracellular nucleotides and adenosine in neuroglia communication, the comprehensive understanding of purinome dynamics might provide new research perspectives to decipher ALS and help to design more efficient and targeted drugs. This review will focus on the purinergic players involved in ALS etiology and disease progression and current therapeutic strategies to enhance neuroprotection and suppress neurotoxicity."

MR stimulation was also examined with a higher frequency (24 Hz) or a delayed start (7 days after injury). Controls had sham injuries, inactive stimulators, or both. The stimulation caused no apparent acute responses or adverse long-term changes. In water-maze trials conducted 5 weeks post-injury, early 8-Hz MR and DR stimulation restored the rate of acquisition of reference memory for a hidden platform of fixed location. Short-term spatial working memory, for a variably located hidden platform, was restored only by early 8-Hz MR stimulation. All stimulation protocols reversed injury-induced asymmetry of spontaneous forelimb reaching movements tested 6 weeks post-injury. Post-mortem histological measurement at 8 weeks post-injury revealed volume losses in parietal-occipital cortex and decussating white matter (corpus callosum plus external capsule), but not hippocampus. The cortical losses were significantly reversed by early 8-Hz MR and DR stimulation, the white matter losses by all forms of MR stimulation. The generally most effective protocol, 8-Hz MR stimulation, was tested 3 days post-injury for its acute effect on forebrain cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key trophic signaling molecule. This procedure reversed injury-induced declines of cAMP levels in both cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, midbrain raphe nuclei can enduringly enhance recovery from early disseminated TBI, possibly in part through increased signaling by cAMP in efferent targets. A neurosurgical treatment for TBI using interim electrical stimulation in raphe repair centers is suggested."

Then, we hypothesized that PHB1 overexpression by delivery of AdPHB1 could result in neuroprotection and promote functional recovery following SCI. Briefly, Wistar rats received a 35-g clip-compression injury and were administered AdPHB1 or Ad immediately following SCI. It was found that Ad-PHB1 administration significantly improved locomotor function and increased pain tolerance in rats with SCI. Furthermore, Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI attenuated axonal degradation and increased neuron sparing. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI reduced apoptosis through inhibiting the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 pathway. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress, evidenced by reduced mRNA levels of CCAAT enhancer binding protein homologous protein, chaperone-ucose-regulated protein 78, and X-box protein 1. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI restored mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate formation, reduced reactive oxygen species formation, and improved mitochondrial respiration rates. Finally, Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI activated downstream signals including phosphatidylinositol- 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and nuclear factor-kappaB.

Connexin43 hemichannels have been called ""pathological pores"" based upon their role in secondary lesion spread, edema, inflammation, and neuronal loss following central nervous system injuries, as well as in chronic inflammatory disease. Both connexin43 hemichannels and pannexin channels released adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during ischemia in an in vitro ischemia model, but only connexin43 hemichannels contributed to ATP release during reperfusion. Tonabersat inhibited connexin43 hemichannel-mediated ATP release during both ischemia and reperfusion phases, with direct channel block confirmed using electrophysiology. Tonabersat also reduced connexin43 gap junction coupling in vitro, but only at higher concentrations, with junctional plaques internalized and degraded via the lysosomal pathway. Systemic delivery of tonabersat in a rat bright-light retinal damage model (a model for dry age-related macular degeneration) resulted in significantly improved functional outcomes assessed using electroretinography. Tonabersat also prevented thinning of the retina, especially the outer nuclear layer and choroid, assessed using optical coherence tomography. We conclude that tonabersat, already given orally to over 1000 humans in clinical trials (as a potential treatment for, and prophylactic treatment of, migraine because it was thought to inhibit cortical spreading depression), is a connexin hemichannel inhibitor and may have the potential to be a novel treatment of central nervous system injury and chronic neuroinflammatory disease."

Neural activation to inspiratory muscles was assessed by right and left parasternal intercostal and diaphragm EMGs during quiet breathing and maximal inspiratory efforts. Global respiratory drive was assessed by P-100, and inspiratory muscle force was assessed by maximal inspiratory pressures and vital capacity. Both long-term orally administered and acute IV theophylline increased neural activation to the diaphragm, especially on the more affected left aide. Theophylline treatment was also associated with an increase in global central respiratory drive and inspiratory muscle force, without changing expiratory airflows. Left diaphragm EMG activity was markedly increased following the administration of theophylline. Of interest, upper parasternal intercostal EMG activity was also recruited on the left in spite of being below the level of cervical injury. We speculate that the administration of theophylline in selected patients with an asymmetric cervical spinal cord injury may activate latent bulbospinal respiratory pathways and improve inspiratory muscle function, reducing the likelihood of associated respiratory failure."

Inosine is a naturally occurring metabolite of adenosine that crosses the cell membrane and, in neurons, activates Mst3b, a protein kinase that is part of a signal transduction pathway that regulates axon outgrowth. Compared to saline-treated controls, rats with dorsal hemisections that were treated with inosine showed three times as many synaptic contacts between corticospinal tract collaterals and long propriospinal interneurons that project from the cervical cord to the lumbar level.

It has been reported that application of sciatic nerve conditioning injury plays a positive role in repairing the injury of the ascending spinal sensory pathway in laboratory animals. Because of the complexity of SCI and related ethics challenges, sciatic nerve conditioning injury cannot be applied in clinical therapy. Accordingly, it is extremely important to study its mechanism and develop replacement therapy. Based on empirical study and clinical trials, this article suggests that miR-142-3p is the key therapeutic target for repairing sensory function, based on the following evidence. Firstly, studies have reported that endogenous cAMP is the upstream regulator of 3 signal pathways that are partially involved in the mechanisms of sciatic nerve conditioning injury, promoting neurite growth. The regulated miR-142-3p can induce cAMP elevation via adenylyl cyclase 9 (AC9), which is abundant in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Secondly, compared with gene expression regulation in the injured spinal cord, inhibition of microRNA (miRNA) in DRG is less likely to cause trauma and infection. Thirdly, evidence of miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in many diseases has been reported. In this article we suggest, for the first time, imitating sciatic nerve conditioning injury, thereby enhancing central regeneration of primary sensory neurons via interfering with the congenerous upstream regulator AC9 of the 3 above-mentioned signal pathways. We hope to provide a new clinical treatment strategy for the recovery of sensory function in SCI patients."

In this study, sciatic nerves from P2X(7) knockout mice were analyzed for altered expression of myelin-associated proteins and for alterations in nerve morphology. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that, in the wild-type peripheral nerves, the P2X(7) receptor was localized mainly in myelinating SCs, with only a few immunopositive nonmyelinating SCs. Complete absence of P2X(7) receptor protein was confirmed in the sciatic nerves of the knockout mice by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis revealed that expression levels of the myelin proteins protein zero and myelin-associated glycoprotein are reduced in P2X(7) knockout nerves. In accordance with the molecular results, transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that P2X(7) knockout nerves possess significantly more unmyelinated axons, contained in a higher number of Remak bundles. The myelinating/nonmyelinating SC ratio was also decreased in knockout mice, and we found a significantly increased number of irregular fibers compared with control nerves. Nevertheless, the myelin thickness in the knockout was unaltered, suggesting a stronger role for P2X(7) in determining SC maturation than in myelin formation. In conclusion, we present morphological and molecular evidence of the importance of P2X(7) signaling in peripheral nerve maturation and in determining SC commitment to a myelinating phenotype.

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A(1) adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine Al receptors. Theophylline induced, and maintained, hemidiaphragmatic recovery for prolonged periods after C(2) spinal cord hemisection in rats and may prove to be beneficial in assisting respiration in spinal cord injury patients."

Long-term evaluation showed that mice administered 20 mg"" kg-1. day-1 quercetin for 35 days had a greater sensorimotor recovery compared with all other treatment groups. The mechanisms behind these effects were further investigated, and quercetin was found to regulate the expression of genes involved in regeneration and trophic support.

In addition, quercetin enhanced axon remyelination, motor nerve conduction velocity and plantar muscle function, indicating that the degree of distal portion hypotrophy during the peripheral axon regeneration process was reduced. These results suggest that quercetin accelerates functional recovery by up-regulating neuronal intrinsic growth capacity and postponing distal atrophy.

The major drawback of this compound is its inhibitory effect on proliferation of hMSCs. Therefore, we investigated whether fine-tuning of the dose and timing of PKA activation could enhance bone formation even further, with minimum effects on proliferation. To test this, we selected two different PKA activators (8-bromo-cAMP (8-br-cAMP) and forskolin) and compared their effects on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation with those of db-cAMP. We found that all three compounds induced alkaline phosphatase levels, bone-specific target genes, and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1, although 8-br-cAMP induced adipogenic differentiation in long-term cultures and was thus considered unsuitable for further in vivo testing. All three compounds inhibited proliferation of hMSCs in a dose-dependent manner, with forskolin inhibiting proliferation most. The effect of forskolin on in vivo bone formation was tested by pretreating hMSCs before implantation, and we observed greater amounts of bone using forskolin than db-cAMP.

The regeneration of injured neurons is a process involving many intracellular phenomena, including cytoskeletal changes, gene and protein expression, and changes in the responsiveness to extracellular cues. The capacity of injured neurons to regenerate is modulated to some extent by changes in the expression of intracellular signaling molecules such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.

We hypothesized that SCI might lead to alteration in the RNA editing of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors that govern critical determinants of neuronal survival. To this end, we examined the molecular changes set in motion by SCI that affect the channel properties of AMPA receptors. SCI strongly reduced the level of AMPA receptor R/G editing, involving not only the site of the lesion but also adjacent areas of the cord spared by the lesion. The effects, with changes for some subunits and loci, were observed as long as 30 days after lesioning and may correlate with a partial decrease in enzymatic activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), as deduced from the analysis of ADAR2 self-editing. The reduced editing at the R/G site of glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs) is likely to reduce post-synaptic excitatory responses to glutamate, thus limiting the progression of cell death; however, prolonged suppression of GluR function in later stages may hinder synaptic plasticity. These observations provide the first direct evidence of the potential contribution of RNA editing to excitatory neural injury and recovery after SCI."

We hypothesized that combining GRP transplants with rolipram and cAMP would improve functional recovery, similar to that seen after combining Schwann cell transplants with increasing cAMP. A short term study, (1) uninjured control, (2) SCI + vehicle, and (3) SCI + cAMP, showed that spinal cord [cAMP] was increased 14 days after SCI. We used 51 male rats subjected to a thoracic SCI fora 12-week survival study: (1) SCI + vehicle, (2) SCI + GRP, (3) SCI + CAMP, (4) SCI + GRP + cAMP, and (5) uninjured endpoint age-matched control (AM). Rolipram was administered for 2 weeks after SCI. At 9 days after SCI, GRP transplantation and injection of dibutyryl-cAMP into the spinal cord were performed. GRP cells survived, differentiated, and formed extensive transplants that were well integrated with host tissue. Presence of GRP cells increased the amount of tissue in the lesion; however, cAMP reduced the graft size. White matter sparing at the lesion epicenter was not affected. Serotonergic input to the lumbosacral spinal cord was not affected by treatment but the amount of serotonin immediately caudal to the lesion was reduced in the CAMP groups. Using telemetric monitoring of corpus spongiosum penis pressure we show that the cAMP groups regained the same number of micturitions per 24 hours when compared to the AM group, however, the frequency of peak pressures was increased in these groups compared to the AM group. In contrast, the GRP groups had similar frequency of peak pressures compared to baseline and the AM group. Animals that received GRP cells regained the same number of erectile events per 24 hours compared to baseline and the AM group. Since cAMP reduced the GRP transplant graft, and some modest positive effects were seen that could be attributable to both GRP or CAMP, future research is required to determine how cAMP affects survival, proliferation, and/or function of progenitor cells and how this is related to function. cAMP may not always be a desirable addition to a progenitor cell transplantation strategy after SCI.

Spinal cord transection was performed at the T-9-T-10 level 2-3 weeks prior to the experiment and a microdialysis fiber was inserted in the L-6-S-1, lumbosacral spinal cord one day before the experiments. Mechanically evoked (i.e. 10 cm/W bladder pressure) ATP release into the bladder lumen was approximately 6.5-fold higher in SCI compared to NI rats (p < 0.05). Intravesical carbachol (CCh) induced a significantly greater release of ATP in the bladder from SCI as compared to NI rats (3424.32 +/- 1255.57 pmol/ml versus 613.74 +/- 470.44 pmol/ml, respectively, p < 0.05). However, ATP release in NI or SCI rats to intravesical CCh was not affected by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Atr). Spinal release of ATP to bladder stimulation with 10 cm/W pressure was five-fold higher in SCI compared to NI rats (p < 0.05). CCh also induced a significantly greater release of spinal ATP in SCI rats compared to controls (4.3 +/- 0.9 pmol versus 0.90 +/- 0.15 pmol, p < 0.05). Surprisingly, the percent inhibitory effect of Atr on CCh-induced ATP release was less pronounced in SCI as compared to NI rats (49% versus 89%, respectively). SCI induces a dramatic increase in intravesical pressure and cholinergic receptor evoked bladder and spinal ATP release. Muscarinic receptors do not mediate intravesical CCh-induced ATP release into the bladder lumen in NI or SCI rats. In NI rats sensory muscarinic receptors are the predominant mechanism by which CCh induces ATP release from primary afferents within the lumbosacral spinal cord. Following SCL however, nicotinic or purinergic receptor mechanisms become active, as evidenced by the fact that Atr was only partially effective in inhibiting CCh-induced spinal ATP release.

We investigated axonal sprouting along with the efficiency of the infusion of the stromal cell-derived growth factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) and regenerative growth along with the anti-scarring treatment (AST) in young (2-3 months) and geriatric (22-28 months) female rats following SCI. AST included local injection of iron chelator (2,2'-dipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid) and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate solution into the lesion core. Axon outgrowth was investigated by immunohistological methods at 5 weeks after a partial dorsal hemisection at thoracic level T8. We found that aging significantly reduces spontaneous axon sprouting of corticospinal (CST), serotonergic (5-HT) raphespinal and catecholaminergic (TH) coerulospinal tracts in distinct regions of the spinal cord rostral to the lesion. However, impairment of axon sprouting could be markedly attenuated in geriatric animals by local infusion of SDF-1. Unexpectedly and in contrast to rostral sprouting, aging does not diminish the regenerative growth capacity of 5-HT-, TH- and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive axons at 5 weeks after SCI. Moreover, 5-HT and TH axons maintain the ability to react upon AST with significantly enhanced regeneration in aged animals. These data are the first to demonstrate, that old age compromises axonal plasticity, but not regenerative growth, after SCI in a fiber tract-specific manner. Furthermore, AST and SDF-1 infusions remain efficient, which implicates that therapy in elderly patients is still feasible. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In another study, transplanted SCs transduced to generate a bifunctional neurotrophin (D15A) led to significant increases in graft SCs and axons, including supraspinal and myelinated axons. Here we studied the growth and myelination of local and supraspinal axons and functional outcome following the combination of rolipram administration and neurotrophin-transduced SC implantation after SCI. Rolipram was administered subcutaneously for 4 weeks immediately after contusion at vertebral T8 (25.0-mm weight drop, MASCIS impactor). GFP or GFP-D15A-transduced SCs were injected into the injury epicenter 1 week after SCI. GFP-D15A SC grafts and GFP SC grafts with rolipram contained significantly more serotonergic fibers compared to GFP SCs. SC myelinated axons were increased significantly in GFP SC with rolipram-treated animals compared to animals receiving SCI alone. Rolipram administered with either GFP or GFP-D15A SCs significantly increased numbers of brain stem-derived axons below the lesion/implant area and improved hindlimb function. Compared to the single treatments, the combination led to the largest SC grafts, the highest numbers of serotonergic fibers in the grafts, and increased numbers of axons from the reticular formation below the lesion/implant area and provided the greatest improvement in hindlimb function.

In this study, using a minipump-based infusion system, we found that intraspinal infusion with VPA for 3 days into injured spinal cord significantly improved hindlimb locomotion of rats with severe SCI induced by a 10-g NYU impactor dropping from the height of 50 mm onto the spinal T9/10 segment.

For these reasons, and that oligodendrocyte and axon survival may be related, various neuroprotective strategies after spinal cord injury are being investigated. We previously demonstrated that oligodendrocytes in the adult rat epicenter ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) express 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and that their death was attenuated up to 3 days after contusive cervical SCI when rolipram, a specific inhibitor of PDE4, was administered.

This is the first demonstration of improved descending and ascending long-tract axonal conductivity across a SCI with this pharmacological approach. Since descending long-tract axonal conductivity did not return to normal, further evaluations of the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic window of rolipram as well as optimal combinations are necessary before consideration for neuroprotection in humans with SCI.

The objective of the present study was to assess quantitatively recovery after chronic theophylline administration, the effects of weaning from the drug, and the effects of the drug on adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression in adult rats subjected to a C2 hemisection. Rats subjected to a left C2 hemisection received theophylline orally for 3, 7, 12, or 30 days and were classified as 3D, 7D, 12D, or 30D respectively. Separate groups of 3D animals were weaned from drug administration for 7, 12, and 30 days before assessment of respiratory recovery. Additional groups of 7D and 12D animals were also weaned from drug administration for 7 and 12 days prior to assessment. Sham-operated controls received theophylline vehicle for similar periods. Quantitative assessment of recovered respiratory activity was conducted under standardized electrophysiologic recording conditions approximately 18 h after each drug application period. Serum theophylline analysis was conducted at the end of electrophysiologic recordings. Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression in the phrenic nucleus was assessed with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Chronic theophylline induced a dose-dependent effect on respiratory recovery over a serum theophylline range of 1.2-1.9 mug/ml. Recovery was characterized as respiratory-related activity in the left phrenic nerve and expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals under similar recording conditions. Recovered activity was 34.13 +/- 2.07, 55.89 +/- 2.96, 74.78 +/- 1.93, and 79.12 +/- 1.75% respectively in the 3D, 7D, 12D, and 30D groups. Theophylline-induced recovered activity persisted for as long as 30 days when drug administration was stopped and serum levels of the drug were virtually undetected. Furthermore, recovered activity in 3D and 7D animals increased significantly as a function of duration of weaning. Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression was not significantly changed by theophylline administration. It is concluded that recovery of respiratory function in C2-hemisected rats induced by chronic theophylline is unrelated to adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression. Recovered activity persists even when drug administration has been stopped. The significance of our results is that in the clinical application of theophylline to improve respiratory impairment, intermittent drug administration may be sufficient to engender and maintain the therapeutic benefits of the drug.

The alkylxanthines were selected based on their diverse pharmacologic profiles to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie functional recovery after spinal cord injury. To quantitatively assess the magnitude of recovery, electrophysiological experiments were conducted on pancuronium-paralyzed, hemisected animals under standardized recording conditions. The total absence of respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and paralyzed hemidiaphragm was used as the index of a functionally complete hemisection. Thereafter, drug-induced recovered activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection was quantified and expressed either as a percentage of contralateral phrenic nerve activity in the same animal prior to drug administration or as a percentage of predrug activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals. With either approach, theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced respiratory-related recovered activity. Enprofylline, a potent bronchodilator, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist with limited access to the central nervous system, were ineffective. Maximal recovery was attained with theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 mg/kg). At these doses, theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline induced recovery that was 70.0 +/- 2.5 and 69.3 +/- 4.1% of predrug contralateral nerve activity respectively.

Previous studies have demonstrated that rolipram, an anti-inflammatory and cyclic adenosine monophosphate preserving small molecule, improves spinal cord regeneration when delivered systemically. However, more recent studies showed that rolipram has some adverse effects in spinal cord repair. Here, we developed a drug-delivery platform for the local delivery of rolipram into the spinal cord. The potential of drug-eluting microfibrous patches for continuous delivery of high and low-dose rolipram concentrations was characterized in vitro. Following C5 hemisections, athymic rats were treated with patches loaded with low and high doses of rolipram. In general, animals treated with low-dose rolipram experienced greater functional and anatomical recovery relative to all other groups. Outcomes from the high-dose rolipram treatment were similar to those with no treatment. In addition, high-dose treated animals experienced reduced survival rates suggesting that systemic toxicity was reached. With the ability to control the release of drug dosage locally within the spinal cord, drug-eluting microfibrous patches demonstrate the importance of appropriate local release-kinetics of rolipram, proving their usefulness as a therapeutic platform for the study and repair of SCI.

The trauma was produced 2 hours later by compression of the cord with a 9-, 35-, or 50-g load for 5 min. Microdialysis samples (10-minute fractions) were collected for another 2 hours following decompression. The trauma was associated with an accumulation of lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine, and an increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio in the ECF, indicating a profound disturbance in energy metabolism. These changes were related to the severity of spinal cord injury as well as to the spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) reductions and neurological deteriorations previously determined. Following decompression, all ECF metabolites normalized within 20-40 min after mild (9 g) to moderate (35 g) trauma. After severe trauma (50 g), resulting in complete ischemia during compression, followed by irreversible paraplegia, there was a partial recovery of ECF inosine and hypoxanthine, whereas the increase in lactate and the lactate/pyruvate ratio persisted. The results suggest that penumbra conditions prevail during the early posttraumatic period when the degree of trauma results in severe neurological deterioration and that ECF lactate levels in the spinal cord is a sensitive indicator of secondary ischemia after compression injury."

AST included local iron chelator (2,2'-dipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid) injection and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate application to the lesion core. In previous studies, this treatment promoted long-distance regeneration of cut corticospinal tract axons, neuroprotection of projecting cortical neurons and functional improvement of treated rats [N.

Treatment yielded significantly enhanced regrowth of descending serotonergic (5-HT), catecholaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase; TH), corticospinal and rubrospinal axons into the lesion zone, as assessed by anterograde tracing and immunohistochemistry followed by quantification of axon profiles at 5 and 12 weeks post-injury. In addition, the determination of axons crossing the proximal borderline from uninjured tissue into fibrous scar area revealed a significant AST-promoted increase of intersecting fibres for 5-HT, TH and calcitonin gene-related peptide containing ascending sensory fibres. For a prolonged time period after lesion, the delayed (secondary) scar developing in treated rats is significantly more permeable for all analysed axon tracts than the initial (primary) scar forming in injured control animals lacking treatment. Furthermore, enhanced outgrowth of descending axons from fibrous scar into distal healthy spinal tissue was achieved in treated animals, and is in line with previous functional studies [S.

We found that cultured motor neurons isolated from embryonic rat spinal cord express P2X7 and underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis when exposed to exceptionally low concentrations of the P2X7 agonist 2(3)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP. The P2X7 inhibitors BBG, oATP, and KN-62 prevented 2(3)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP-induced motor neuron death. The endogenous P2X7 agonist ATP induced motor neuron death at low concentrations (1-100M). High concentrations of ATP (1mM) paradoxically became protective due to degradation in the culture media to produce adenosine and activate adenosine receptors. P2X7-induced motor neuron death was dependent on neuronal nitric oxide synthase-mediated production of peroxynitrite, p38 activation, and autocrine FAS signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that motor neurons are highly sensitive to P2X7 activation, which triggers apoptosis by activation of the well-established peroxynitrite/FAS death pathway in motor neurons."

Morphometric analysis of rat embryo hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures showed that neurite outgrowth was stimulated by DNP. This effect was accompanied by increases in the neuronal levels of the microtubule-associated protein tau and of cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP). DNP also promoted cAMP accumulation, increased tau level, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal differentiation in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2A. We show that DNP-induced differentiation requires activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The finding that DNP promotes neuritogenesis and neuronal differentiation suggests that, in addition to its anti-amyloidogenic actions, it may be a useful lead compound in the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting neurite dystrophy and synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease."

Previous studies have shown that chronic oral administration of theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an adenosine receptor antagonist, can restore function to the quiescent phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to hemisection. Both of these actions of theophylline result in an increase in 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, the chronic theophylline-mediated respiratory recovery persists long after the animals have been weaned from the drug. To date, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the recovery induced by theophylline are still not known. Since theophylline has two modes of action, in the present study we tested whether chronic administration of pentoxifylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 specific inhibitor, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an adenosine A I receptor antagonist, would induce recovery similar to that induced by theophylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats following a left C2 spinal cord lesion. Recovery of left phrenic nerve activity was assessed at 5 or 10 days after the last drug administrations to assess the persistent nature of the recovery. Pentoxifylline, rolipram and DPCPX, all capable of modulating 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, brought about long-term respiratory recovery in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the left C2 lesion at 5 and 10 days after the last drug administration.

Increasing the levels of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) after spinal cord injury enhances axon regeneration across a wide variety of species, making it an excellent candidate molecule that has therapeutic potential. However, several important aspects of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which cAMP enhances axon regeneration are still unclear, such as how cAMP affects axon growth patterns, the molecular components within growing axon tips, the lesion scar, and neuronal survival. To address these points, we took advantage of the large, identified reticulospinal (RS) neurons in lamprey, a vertebrate that exhibits robust axon regeneration after a complete spinal cord transection. Application of a cAMP analog, db-cAMP, at the time of spinal cord transection increased the number of axons that regenerated across the lesion site. Db-cAMP also promoted axons to regenerate in straighter paths, prevented abnormal axonal growth patterns, increased the levels of synaptotagmin within axon tips, and increased the number of axotomized neurons that survived after spinal cord injury, thereby increasing the pool of neurons available for regeneration. There was also a transient increase in the number of microglia/macrophages and improved repair of the lesion site. Taken together, these data reveal several new features of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cAMP-mediated enhancement of axon regeneration, further emphasizing the positive roles for this conserved pathway.

Dia (not T2 EIC) LTF is enhanced by systemic adenosine 2A (A2A) receptor inhibition in normal rats. We investigated the respective contributions of Dia and T2 EIC to daily AIH-induced functional recovery of breathing capacity with/without A2A receptor antagonist (KW6002, i.p.) following C2 hemisection (C2HS). Rats received daily AIH (dAIH: 10, 5-min episodes, 10.5% O2; 5-min normoxic intervals; 7 successive days beginning 7 days post-C2HS) or daily normoxia (dNx) with/without KW6002, followed by weekly (reminder) presentations for 8 weeks. Ventilation and EMGs from bilateral diaphragm and T2 EIC muscles were measured with room air breathing (21% O-2) and maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (MCS: 7% CO2, 10.5% O-2). dAIH increased tidal volume (VT) in C2HS rats breathing room air (dAIH + vehicle: 0.47 +/- 0.02, dNx + vehicle: 0.40 +/- 0.01 ml/100 g; p < 0.05) and MCS (dAIH + vehicle: 0.83 +/- 0.01, dNx + vehicle: 0.73 +/- 0.01 ml/100 g; p < 0.001); KW6002 had no significant effect. dAIH enhanced contralateral (uninjured) diaphragm EMG activity, an effect attenuated by KW6002, during room air breathing and MCS (p < 0.05). Although dAIH enhanced contralateral T2 EIC EMG activity during room air breathing, KW6002 had no effect. dAIH had no statistically significant effects on diaphragm or T2 EIC EMG activity ipsilateral to injury. Thus, two weeks post-C2HS: 1) dAIH enhances breathing capacity by effects on contralateral diaphragm and T2 EIC activity; and 2) dAIH-induced recovery is A2A dependent in diaphragm, but not T2 EIC. Daily AIH may be a useful in promoting functional recovery of breathing capacity after cervical spinal injury, but A2A receptor antagonists (e.g. caffeine) may undermine its effectiveness shortly after injury.

Rolipram or vehicle control (10% ethanol) was given subcutaneously (s.c.) daily for 2 wk post-injury (PI) after which the preservation of oligodendrocytes, neurons and central myelinated axons was stereologically assessed. Doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg (given at 1 h PI) increased neuronal survival; 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg/kg protected oligodendrocytes and 1.0 mg/kg produced optimal preservation of central myelinated axons. Ethanol also demonstrated significant neuronal and oligo-protection; though the preservation provided was significantly less than Rolipram. Subsequent use of this optimal Rolipram dose, 1.0 mg/kg, via different routes (i.v., s.c. or oral, 1 h PI), demonstrated that i.v. administration produced the most significant and consistent cyto- and axo-protection, although all routes were effective. Examination of the therapeutic window for i. v. Rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), when initiated between 1 and 48 h after SCI, revealed maximal neuroprotection at 2 h post-SCI, although the protective efficacy of Rolipram could still be observed when administration was delayed for up to 48 h PI. Importantly, use of the optimal Rolipram regimen significantly improved locomotor function after SCI as measured by the BBB score. Lastly we show SCI-induced changes in PDE4A, B and D expression and phosphorylation as well as cytokine expression and immune cell infiltration. We demonstrate that Rolipram abrogates SCI-induced PDE4B1 and PDE4A5 production, PDE4A5 phosphorylation, MCP-1 expression and immune cell infiltration, while preventing post-injury reductions in IL-10.

Both drugs are methylxanthines; however, theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist while enprofylline is not. To further test the involvement of adenosine receptors, N6 (L-2-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA), an analogue of adenosine was used in conjunction with theophylline. Following a left C2 spinal cord hemisection, animals were injected with either enprofylline (2.5-20 mg/kg) or theophylline (15 mg/kg) alone or in combination. Theophylline-injected animals demonstrated robust respiratory-related activity in the previously quiescent left phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm. No recovery was observed in any of the enprofylline-injected rats. When enprofylline injection was followed later with theophylline, recovery occurred. Prior L-PIA administration blocked theophylline-induced recovery. When given after theophylline, L-PIA attenuated and then blocked the induced activity in both the nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to spinal cord hemisection.

The regenerative capacity of the olfactory system has attracted scientific interest. Studies focusing on animal and human olfactory bulb ensheathing cells (OECs) have heightened the expectations that OECs can enhance axonal regeneration and repair demyelinating diseases. Harvest of OECs from the olfactory bulb requires highly invasive surgery, which is a major obstacle. In contrast, olfactory epithelium (OE) has a unique regenerative capacity and is readily accessible from its location in the nasal cavity, allowing for harvest without lasting damage to the donor. Adult OE contains progenitors responsible for the normal life-long continuous replacement of neurons and supporting cells. Culture techniques have been established for human OE that generate populations of mitotically active neural progenitors that form neurospheres (Roisen et al., 2001; Winstead et al., 2005). The potential application of this technology includes autologous transplantation where minimal donor material can be isolated, expanded ex vivo, and lineage restricted to a desired phenotype prior to/or after re-implantation. Furthermore, these strategies circumvent the ethical issues that arise with embryonic or fetal tissues. The long term goal is to develop procedures through which a victim of a spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative condition would serve as a source of progenitors for his/her own regenerative grafts, avoiding the need for immunosuppression and ethical controversy. In addition, these cells can provide populations for pharmacological and/or diagnostic evaluation."

Recently, low-frequency electrical stimulation (as brief as an hour) has shown promise, as it significantly accelerated regeneration in animal models through speeding of axon growth across the injury site."

Adenosine 5' monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the downstream protein, play key roles in metabolizing of energy, resisting of resistance, and cellular protein homeostasis. In this study, we determined the effects of resveratrol on SCI and their potential relationship with SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis. To determine the effect of resveratrol on SCI recovery, a spinal cord contusion model was employed. Rats received treatment with resveratrol or DMSO immediately following contusion. We determined that Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were significantly higher for injured rats treated with resveratrol. Nissl and HE staining revealed that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and lesion size in the spinal cord of injured rats when compared to vehicle-treated animals. Spinal cord tissue was assessed by Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses 7 days after injury for changes in expression of SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis proteins. Expression of SIRT1, p-AMPK, Beclin-1, LC3-B, and Bcl-2 was elevated in resveratrol-treated animals, whereas expression of p62, Cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) was inhibited. Immunofluorescence analysis of primary neurons treated with resveratrol alone or in combination with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) or EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) revealed that treatment with the inhibitors blocks the increased LC3-B expression in cells and increases the portion of TUNEL-positive cells. Taken together, these results suggest that resveratrol exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI by regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway. (C) 2017 IBRO.

Cytotoxic events following SAH, such as extracellular accumulation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), may activate the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7R)/cryopyrin inflammasome axis, thus inducing the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta/IL-18 secretion. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of P2X7R/cryropyrin inflammasome axis would ameliorate neuroinflammation after SAH. In the present study, SAH was induced by the endovascular perforation in rats. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of P2X7R or cryopyrin were administered intracerebroventricularly 24 h before SAH. Brilliant blue G (BBG), a non-competitive antagonist of P2X7R, was administered intraperitoneally 30 min following SAH. Post-assessments including SAH severity score, neurobehavioral test, brain water content, Western blot and immunofluorescence, were performed. Administration of P2X7R and cryopyrin siRNA as well as pharmacologic blockade of P2X7R by BBG ameliorated neurological deficits and brain edema at 24 h following SAH. Inhibition of P2X7R/cryopyrin inflammasome axis suppressed caspase-1 activation, which subsequently decreased maturation of IL-1 beta/IL-18. To investigate the link between P2X7R and cryopyrin inflammasome in vivo, Benzoylbenzoyl-ATP (BzATP), a P2X7R agonist, was given to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) primed naive rats with scramble or cryopyrin siRNAs. In LPS-primed naive rats, BzATP induced caspase-1 activation and mature IL-1 beta release were neutralized by cryopyrin RNA. Thus, the P2X7R/cryopyrin inflammasome axis may contribute to neuroinflamrnation via activation of caspase-1 and thereafter mature IL-1 beta/1-18 production following SAH. Therapeutic interventions targeting P2X7R/cryopyrin pathway may be a novel approach to ameliorate EBI following SAH. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Ligands that activate G(s)-protein-coupled receptors, such as the adenosine 2a receptor, mimic the effects of neurotrophins in vitro by transactivating their high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, the Trk receptors. Thus, we hypothesized that A2a receptor agonists would elicit phrenic long-term facilitation by mimicking the effects of BDNF on TrkB receptors. Here we demonstrate that spinal A2a receptor agonists transactivate TrkB receptors in the rat cervical spinal cord near phrenic motoneurons, thus inducing long-lasting ( hours) phrenic motor facilitation. A2a receptor activation increased phosphorylation and new synthesis of an immature TrkB protein, induced TrkB signaling through Akt, and strengthened synaptic pathways to phrenic motoneurons. RNA interference targeting TrkB mRNA demonstrated that new TrkB protein synthesis is necessary for A2a-induced phrenic motor facilitation. A2a receptor activation also increased breathing in unanesthetized rats, and improved breathing in rats with cervical spinal injuries. Thus, small, highly permeable drugs ( such as adenosine receptor agonists) that transactivate TrkB receptors may provide an effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with ventilatory control disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, or respiratory insufficiency after spinal injury or during neurodegenerative diseases."

However, many drugs with potential neuropharmacological activity, such as adenosine, are inefficient upon systemic administration because of their fast metabolization and rapid clearance from the bloodstream. Here, we show that conjugation of adenosine to the lipid squalene and the subsequent formation of nanoassemblies allows prolonged circulation of this nucleoside, providing neuroprotection in mouse stroke and rat spinal cord injury models. The animals receiving systemic administration of squalenoyl adenosine nanoassemblies showed a significant improvement of their neurologic deficit score in the case of cerebral ischaemia, and an early motor recovery of the hindlimbs in the case of spinal cord injury. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the nanoassemblies were able to extend adenosine circulation and its interaction with the neurovascular unit. This Article shows, for the first time, that a hydrophilic and rapidly metabolized molecule such as adenosine may become pharmacologically efficient owing to a single conjugation with the lipid squalene."

Due to accumulation of numerous axon-growth inhibitory molecules the lesion scar is considered a major impediment for axon regeneration. Following transection of the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) at thoracic level 8 in adult rats, transient suppression of collagenous scarring in the lesion zone by local application of a potent iron chelator and cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulted in the delay of fibrous scarring. Treated animals displayed long-distance growth of CST axons through the lesion area extending for up to 1.5-2 cm into the distal cord. In addition, the treatment showed a strong neuroprotective effect, rescuing cortical motoneurons projecting into the CST that normally die (30%) after thoracic axotomy. Further, anterogradely traced CST axons regenerated through both grey and white matter and developed terminal arborizations in grey matter regions. In contrast to controls, injured animals receiving treatment showed significant functional recovery in the open field, in the horizontal ladder and in CatWalk locomotor tasks. We conclude that the fibrous lesion scar plays a pivotal role as a growth barrier for regenerating axons in adult spinal cord and that a delay in fibrotic scarring by local inhibition of collagen biosynthesis and basement membrane deposition is a promising and unique therapeutic strategy for treating human spinal trauma."

Our goal has been to find effective combination strategies to improve outcome after injury to the adult rat thoracic spinal cord. Combination interventions tested have been implantation of Schwann cells (SCs) plus neuroprotective agents and growth factors administered in various ways, olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) implantation, chondroitinase addition, or elevation of cyclic AMP. The most efficacious strategy in our hands for the acute complete transection/SC bridge model, including improvement in locomotion [Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan Scale (BBB)], is the combination of SCs, OECs, and chondroitinase administration (BBB 2.1 vs 6.6, 3 times more myelinated axons in the SC bridge, increased serotonergic axons in the bridge and beyond, and significant correlation between the number of bridge myelinated axons and functional improvement). We found the most successful combination strategy for a subacute spinal cord contusion injury (12.5-mm, 10-g weight, MASCIS impactor) to be SCs and elevation of cyclic AMP (BBB 10.4 vs 15, significant increases in white matter sparing, in myelinated axons in the implant, and in responding reticular formation and red and raphe nuclei, and a significant correlation between the number of serotonergic fibers and improvement in locomotion). Thus, in two injury paradigms, these combination strategies as well as others studied in our laboratory have been found to be more effective than SCs alone and suggest ways in which clinical application may be developed."

In this study, we characterize the functional properties of P2X7 receptors using electrophysiology and Ca2+ monitoring in primary cortical neuron cultures and in brain slices. Both electrical responses and Ca2+ influx induced by ATP and benzoyl-ATP were reduced by Brilliant Blue G (BBG) at concentrations which specifically inhibit P2X7 receptors. In turn, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) caused neuronal death that was reduced with BBC application. OGD in neuron cultures and brain slices generated an inward current, which was delayed and reduced by BOG. To assess the relevance of these in vitro findings, we used middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats as a model of transient focal cerebral ischemia to study the neuroprotective effect of BOG in vivo. Treatment with BBG (twice per day, 30 mg/kg) produced a 60% reduction in the extent of brain damage compared to treatment with vehicle alone. These results show that P2X7 purinergic receptors mediate tissue damage after OGD in neurons and following transient brain ischemia. Therefore, these receptors are a relevant molecular target for the development of new treatments to attenuate brain damage following stroke. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

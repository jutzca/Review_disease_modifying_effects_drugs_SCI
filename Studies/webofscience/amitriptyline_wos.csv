It aims to facilitate the implementation of the Three Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement), with an emphasis on refinement. Specific animal welfare issues were identified and discussed, and practical measures proposed, with the aim of reducing animal use and suffering, reducing experimental variability, and increasing translatability within this critically important research field."

Affiliated with the need to bridge a pathophysiological gap in spinal parenchyma and/or reorganize remaining circuitry after injury is a need to bridge resource gaps for timely funding for translational research, gaps in knowledge between researchers, and between researchers/clinicians and SCI patients. The epistemology of cure was examined and redefined to include transitional recoveries and advances. Modes and mechanisms of funding have been evaluated and where deficits were perceived, suggestions have been made to expedite and increase the number and breadth of funding opportunities. Innovative infrastructure changes are submitted. We discuss the progression of clinical trials as well as offer suggestions to facilitate benchtop-to-bedsite translation of valuable research to the customer. Highlights of recently completed, in progress, and future trials are detailed. Finally, we submit five essential processes required to promote advances to the SCI patient population: discovery, development, clinical trials, evaluation, and rehabilitation. These ideas are intended to facilitate entry of serious dialogue and to ultimately improve the lives of patients living with SCI."

Extracellular polymeric substances from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (EPS-A) are high molecular weight polysaccharides. The present study aimed to elucidate the protective effects of EPS-A on neurotoxicity induced by local anesthetics in an intraperitoneal injection bupivacaine rat model. The results of immunohistochemical staining inicated that following intraperitoneal injection of EPS-A the levels of apoptosis and caspase-3 decreased, and the expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin1 increased. In order to further clarify the mechanism of the EPS-A-mediated protection, the expression of key proteins associated with autophagy was investigated by western blotting. The results suggested that the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and the expression level of beclin1 increased. Taken together, the results indicated that EPS-A induced neuroprotective effects on bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of apoptosis, upregulation of autophagy and improvement of cell survival. The results suggested that EPS-A may be a candidate neuroprotective agent against neurotoxicity caused by local anesthetics."

This primary injury is followed by a devastating secondary SCI. It has been shown that various microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in secondary SCI. The present study explored the role of miR-489-3p on secondary SCI, and its underlying mechanisms. First, we determined the expression of miR-489-3p in blood samples of SCI patients and healthy controls. Further experiments were performed on human neural cell lines, treated with bupivacaine to induce neuron damage. The cultured neural cells were transfected with miR-489-3p mimic, ASO-miR-489-3p or negative control. We then measured cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured neurons, followed by measurement of neurite outgrowth. After confirming NAA10 as a target gene for miR-489-3p, we measured expression of NAA10 in neurons transfected with miR-489-3p. Finally, we evaluated the effects of miR-489-3p on the PI3K/AKT signal pathway. miR-489-3p was highly expressed in SCI patients and in bupivacaine-treated injured neurons. In cell model, miR-489-3p inhibited proliferation of neurons and promoted apoptosis. miR-489-3p and bupivacaine synergistically inhibited neurite growth. NAA10 gene was negatively regulated by miR-489-3p. Overexpression of NAA10 reversed the effects of nniR-489-3p on neurons. Lastly, we found that the inhibitory effects of miR-489-3p on neurons are mediated via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway using miR-489-3p inhibitor reversed the effects of miR-489-3p on neurons."

After 4 ml of lignocaine 1.5% was injected through the catheter, hypotension resulted. Fifty-five minutes later 5 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% produced the same effect. In the recovery room a similar injection resulted in lower blood pressure and temporary apnoea. Sensory and motor deficits were noted the next day and four days later magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spinal cord syringomyelia extending from T5 to T10. Four years later, dysaesthesia from T6 to T10 weakness of the left lower extremity and bladder and bowel dysfunction persist. The risks of inserting thoracic epidural catheters in patients under general anaesthesia and muscle relaxation are discussed, emphasising the possibility of spinal cord injury with disastrous consequences."

This Na+ leak likely occurs via incompletely inactivated voltage-gated Na+ channels. This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 mu M were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (less than or equal to 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 mu M), disopyramide (10-300 mu M) and bupivacaine (10-100 mu M) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 mu M. Procainamide (100-300 mu M) was ineffective. These results suggest that Na+ channel blockers, including commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, may be effective in protecting central white matter, which is a target for anoxic/ischemic injury in diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury."

However, clinical trials have, thus far, been uniformly dis-appointing. This review explores reasons for discrepancies between promising animal studies and disappointing clinical trials and potential barriers to extrapolation of research results from animals to humans. The three major barriers disclosed are: differences in injury type between laboratory-induced SCI and clinical SCI, difficulties in interpreting functional outcome in animals, and inter-species and inter-strain differences in pathophysiology of SCI. These barriers can impair the effectiveness of animal models of SCI to predict human outcomes. While some of these barriers can be overcome, others are inherent to the animal models."

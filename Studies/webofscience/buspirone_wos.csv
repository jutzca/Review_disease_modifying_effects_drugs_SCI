Previous studies in animal models with SCI have demonstrated a promising recovery in respiratory and phrenic nerve activity post-injury induced by the systemic and local administration of serotonin receptor agonists such as Buspirone and Trazodone. Human trials must be performed to determine whether individuals with SCI respond similarly. We hypothesized that Buspirone and Trazodone would decrease the propensity to hypocapnic CSA during sleep. We studied eight males with chronic SCI and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [age: 48.8 +/- 14.2 yr; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 44.9 +/- 23.1] in a single-blind crossover design. For 13 days, participants were randomly assigned either Buspirone (7.5-15 mg twice daily), Trazodone (100 mg), or a placebo followed by a 14-day washout period before crossing over to the other interventions. Study nights included polysomnography and induction of CSA using a noninvasive ventilation protocol. We assessed indexes of SDB, CO2 reserve, apneic threshold (AT), controller gain (CG), plant gain (PG), and ventilatory parameters. CO2 reserve was significantly widened on Buspirone (-3.6 +/- 0.9 mmHg) compared with both Trazodone (-2.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.009) and placebo (-1.8 +/- 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.001) but not on Trazodone vs. placebo (P = 0.061). CG was significantly decreased on Buspirone compared with placebo (1.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.0 +/- 2.0 L/(mmHg.min), P = 0.025) but not on Trazodone compared with placebo (2.5 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.0 +/- 2.0 L/(mmHg.mim); P = 0.065). There were no aignificant differences for PG, AT, or any SDB indexes (AHI, obstructive apnea index, central apnea index, oxygen desaturation index). The administration of Buspirone decreased the susceptibility to induced hypocapnic central apnea by reducing chemosensitivity and increasing CO2 reserve in chronic SCI patients."

Lately, United States Food and Drug Administration-approved buspirone has shown promise and promoted locomotor-like movement occurrence in SCL patients, but evidence on how and where it exerts its effects is lacking. The objective of the present study was, first, to verify buspirone effect on locomotor spinal network and to evaluate if it promoted functional recovery when combined with training. Also, we evaluated buspirone impact on locomotion in mice that had recovered from a previous hemisection before sustaining the spinal transection. This dual lesion paradigm has allowed confirmation of spinal network involvement in recovery after an incomplete SCL. Buspirone acutely increased the number of steps taken, the coupling strength between hindlimbs, angular excursion of the hip joint during locomotion, and improved paw positioning at contact and paw drag (ps<0.05). Moreover, it induced long-lasting improvements of paw positioning at contact and paw drag when combined with training in mice after a dual lesion paradigm. Altogether, the results indicate that buspirone exerts considerable acute facilitation of spinally mediated locomotion, and could be used in combination with training to promote functional recovery after SCL."

Chronic spinal cord injury may be complicated by weight loss, muscle atrophy, and bone loss. Objective. The authors identified a combination pharmacotherapy using buspirone, carbidopa, and L-DOPA (BCD) that elicits bouts of locomotor-like movements in spinal cord-transected (Tx) mice. They then evaluated the effects of 8 weeks of treadmill training in Tx mice that received BCD or BCD + clenbuterol, a monoaminergic agent with anabolic properties, on locomotor function, muscle atrophy, adipose tissue loss, and bone density measures. Methods. Induced locomotor movement, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and femoral bone properties were compared in unoperated control mice, operated controls (untreated, untrained Tx mice), and 2 groups of treated, trained Tx mice (Tx + BCD, Tx + BCD + clenbuterol) that also received training. Results. BCD-and BCD + clenbuterol-treated mice showed comparable levels of locomotor movements that significantly improved over time. Soleus muscle mass and soleus and extensor digitorum longus cross-sectional area significantly increased in both groups of BCD-treated mice, with greater effects in BCD + clenbuterol-treated animals. Fiber type conversion, adipose tissues, bone mineral density, and content were reduced in all Tx groups compared with unoperated control mice. Conclusion. These findings suggest that locomotor movement and muscle properties can be restored to near-normal levels after several weeks of BCD treatment, regular training, and clenbuterol in completely paraplegic animals."

The health benefits associated with physical activity-based rehabilitation in patients with no lower-extremity motor function after a spinal cord injury (SCI) is uncertain. Methods. The authors assessed signs of efficacy, safety, and utility associated with a novel pharmacological combination therapy to activate central pattern generator (CPG) activity and corresponding locomotor activity in complete thoracic Th9/10-transected mice. Results. Subcutaneous administration 4 times per week for 1 month of 1.5 mg/kg buspirone, 1.5 mg/kg apomorphine, 12.5 mg/kg benserazide, and 50 mg/kg L-DOPA induced episodes of weight-bearing stepping on a treadmill in nonassisted paraplegic mice for 45-minute sessions. Hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area and fiber area values as well as several blood cell constituent levels assessed at 30 days postinjury were positively affected by the combination therapy, as compared with controls. Episodes of locomotion remained effective on each treatment. Femoral bone mineral density loss was not prevented by triple therapy. Conclusion. Although translation of these findings needs further experimentation, similar pharmacological activation of the CPG offers a novel therapeutic target to provide some health benefits in motor-complete SCI patients."

We conducted proof-of-concept experiments aimed at assessing efficacy upon oral administration of a novel combination therapy for central pattern generator (CPG) activation and corresponding locomotor movement generation in completely paraplegic animals. Co-administration orally (by gavage) of buspirone, levodopa and carbidopa was found to dose-dependently induce episodes of steady weight-bearing stepping in low-thoracic (Th9/10) spinal cord-transected (Tx) mice (with no other form of assistance or training). Robust hindlimb stepping with weight-bearing capabilities was induced with the tri-therapy but not with clinically relevant doses of these compounds administered separately. These results provide evidence suggesting that this drug combination may be ideally suited to constitute a first-in-class therapy (CPG activator) for locomotor activity induction in chronic SCI individuals, given that efficacy was shown using commercially available brain-permeable small molecules, already known as safe for the treatment of various neurological indications."

We also asked whether these neuromodulatory strategies could facilitate stepping assisted by an exoskeleton (EKSO, EKSO Bionics, CA) that is designed so that the subject can voluntarily complement the work being performed by the exoskeleton. We found that spinal cord stimulation and drug enhanced the level of effort that the subject could generate while stepping in the exoskeleton. In addition, stimulation improved the coordination patterns of the lower limb muscles resulting in a more continuous, smooth stepping motion in the exoskeleton along with changes in autonomic functions including cardiovascular and thermoregulation. Based on these data from this case study it appears that there is considerable potential for positive synergistic effects after complete paralysis by combining the over-ground step training in an exoskeleton, combined with transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation either without or with pharmacological modulation."

Here, we report a C5 hemicontusion SCI model in rats with abnormalities that emulate human post-SCI pathophysiology, including spontaneous recovery processes. Post-C5 SCI rats demonstrated deficits in minute ventilation (Ve) responses to a 7% CO2 challenge that correlated significantly with lesion severities (no injury or 12.5, 25, or 50 mm x 10 g weight drop; New York University impactor; p < 0.001) and ipsilateral motor neuron loss (p = 0.016). Importantly, C5 SCI resulted in at least 4 weeks of respiratory abnormalities that ultimately recovered afterward. Because serotonin is involved in respiration-related neuroplasticity, we investigated the impact of activating 5-HT1A receptors on post-C5 SCI respiratory dysfunction. Treatment with the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylmino)tetralin (8-OH DPAT) (250 mu g/kg, i.p.) restored hypercapnic Ve at 2 and 4 weeks after injury (i.e., similar to 39.2% increase vs post-SCI baseline; p <= 0.033). Improvements in hypercapnic Ve response after single administration of 8-OH DPAT were dose dependent and lasted for similar to 4 h (p <= 0.038 and p <= 0.024, respectively). Treatment with another 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), replicated the results, whereas pretreatment with a 5-HT1A-specific antagonist, 4-iodo-N-[2[4(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-benzamide (3 mg/kg, i.p.) given 20 min before 8-OH DPAT negated the effect of 8-OH DPAT. These results imply a potential clinical use of 5-HT1A agonists for post-SCI respiratory disorders."

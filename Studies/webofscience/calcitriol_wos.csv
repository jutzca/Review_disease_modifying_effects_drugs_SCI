Calcitriol (1 mu g/kg) treatment for 7 consecutive days after SCI was compared SCI control and Sham control rat groups. Calcitriol-treated group had significantly improved outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control, which was confirmed by increased ventral horn motor neurons in Calcitriol-treated group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that calcitriol injection has a significant regulatory effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to control SCI groups, which was associated with significant reduction in IFN-gamma and IL-17A secretion and leukocyte infiltration into injury site. Along with confirmation of immunoregulatory aspects of Calcitriol treatment against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that reducing the extent of progressive tissue loss by Calcitriol therapy in acute phase, could result in better recovery after SCI."

Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D (VD) has neuroprotective actions and can promote function recovery after TBI. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that autophagy could be enhanced following supplementation with an active metabolite of VD (calcitriol). However, it is unclear whether autophagy participates in the protective effects of calcitriol after TBI. To test this hypothesis, we examined the protective effects of calcitriol on TBI-induced neurological impairment and further investigated whether calcitriol could modulate autophagy dysfunction-mediated cell death in the cortex region of rat brain. Methods: Eighty-five male rats (250-280 g) were randomly assigned to sham (n = 15), TBI model (TBI, n = 35) and calcitriol treatment (calcitriol, n = 35) groups. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with calcitriol (1 mu g/kg) at 30 min, 24 h and 48 h post-TBI in the calcitriol group. The lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), was used to evaluate autophagic flux in the TBI and calcitriol groups. Neurological functions were evaluated via the modified neurological severity score test at 1-7 days after TBI or sham operation, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated FITC-dUTP nick-end labeling method was used to evaluate the ability of calcitriol to inhibit apoptosis. The expression of VDR, LC3 and p62 proteins was measured by western blot analysis at 1, 3 and 7 days post-injury. Results: Calcitriol treatment attenuated mNSS at 2-7 days post-TBI (P < 0.05 versus TBI group). Calcitriol dramatically increased VDR protein expression compared with the untreated counterparts at 1, 3 and 7 days post-TBI (P < 0.05). The rate of apoptotic cells in calcitriol-treated rats was significantly reduced compared to that observed in the TBI group (P < 0.05). The LC3II/LC3I ratio was decreased in the cortex region at 1, 3 and 7 days post-TBI in rats treated with calcitriol (p < 0.05 versus TBI group), and the p62 expression was also attenuated (p < 0.05 versus TBI group). The LC3II/LC3I ratio in the calcitriol group was significantly increased when pretreated with CQ (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Calcitriol treatment activated VDR protein expression and attenuated neurological deficits in this rat TBI model. The protective effects might be associated with the restoration of autophagy flux and the decrease in apoptosis in the cortex region of rat brain. (C) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

Lower urinary tract dysfunction is of most concern in the management of SCI patients. Proper management depends on understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of neurogenic bladder. Suprasacral SCI induces detrusor areflexia and urine retention initially. The recovery of lower urinary tract function occurs several weeks later, but the voiding function deteriorates and manifests by hyperreflexia and incomplete voiding secondary to the simultaneous contraction of the detrusor and external urethral sphincter (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) during voiding. Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies of animals reveal that the recovery of lower urinary tract function relies on the plasticity of bladder afferent pathways. The A(delta) afferents convey proprioception and initiate micturition reflex in intact cats and rats. Chronic SCI animals exhibit hyperreflexia during storage and incomplete expulsion during voiding. The A(delta) afferent pathway is replaced by capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber afferents in chronic SCI cats. In chronic SCI rats, voiding is still mediated thru A(delta) afferents. However, C-fiber afferents modify bladder function and induce bladder hyperreflexia and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in chronic SCI rats. Thus, multiple factors have been implicated in the development of neurogenic bladder induced by SCI."

Nociceptive sensory input is capable of altering motor output at the spinal level, and nociceptive neurons are sensitized after SCI. Here we tested the hypotheses that stretch-induced locomotor deficits are dependent on nociceptive afferents by depleting TRPV1+ sensory afferents using capsaicin injections in neonatal rats. Following maturation, animals received 25g-cm contusive SCI at T10. After plateau of locomotor recovery at 6 weeks, daily stretching was performed for 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without stretch, and again for two additional weeks. Animals were sacrificed 2 h after the last stretching session for histological assessments. Consistent with previous findings, stretch-induced drops in locomotor function were observed in nociceptor-intact animals but were nearly absent in nociceptor-depleted animals. These functional changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in the number of c-Fos+ nuclei throughout the lumbar enlargement. As expected, nociceptor-depleted animals had very little CGRP + axonal innervation of the dorsal horn. Nociceptor-intact stretched animals had significantly higher levels of CGRP + as compared to non-stretched SCI rats, suggesting that stretching promoted intraspinal CGRP + sprouting. These results indicate that stretch-induced locomotor dysfunction in animals with incomplete SCI involves C-fibers, adding a negative post SCI role to their adaptive roles (e.g., bladder control), and suggesting that the clinical use of muscle stretching to combat contractures and spasticity may be unintentionally detrimental to locomotor function."

Despite being mostly studied independently from each other, important interactions exist between them in the context of spinal cord injury, whether to the spinal cord or the body. Ongoing or recent past episodes of nociceptive activity can prevent motor learning in spinalized rats. In intact animals, it has been proposed that supraspinal activity could counter the repressive effect of nociception on motor system plasticity, but this has not yet been verified in behavioral conditions. The aim of this study was to test whether a recent episode of nociception affects subsequent motor learning in intact animals. We trained rodents to walk on a custom-made horizontal ladder. After initial training, the rats underwent a week-long rest, during which they were randomly assigned to a control group, or one out of two pain conditions. Nociceptive stimuli of different durations were induced through capsaicin or Complete Freund's Adjuvant injections and timed so that the mechanical hypersensitivity had entirely subsided by the end of the resting period. Training then resumed on a modified version of the horizontal ladder. We evaluated the animals' ability to adapt to the modified task by measuring their transit time and paw misplacements over 4 days. Our results show that prior pain episodes do affect motor learning in neurologically intact rats. Motor learning deficits also seem to be influenced by the duration of the pain episode. Rats receiving a subcutaneous injection of capsaicin displayed immediate signs of mechanical hypersensitivity, which subsided rapidly. Nonetheless, they still showed learning deficits 24 h after injection. Rats who received a Complete Freund's Adjuvant injection displayed mechanical hypersensitivity for up to 7 days during the resting period. When trained on the modified ladder task upon returning to normal sensitivity levels, these rats exhibited more prolonged motor learning deficits, extending over 3 days. Our results suggest that prior pain episodes can negatively influence motor learning, and that the duration of the impairment relates to the duration of the pain episode. Our results highlight the importance of addressing pain together with motor training after injury."

Cell bodies for the vagal afferent fibers are located within the nodose gangla (NG) and the majority of vagal afferent axons are unmyelinated C fibers that are sensitive to capsaicin through activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels. Vagal afferent fibers also express receptors for GI hormones, including cholecystokinin (CCK). Previously, T3-SCI provokes a transient GI inflammatory response as well as a reduction of both gastric emptying and centrally-mediated vagal responses to GI peptides, including CCK. TRPV1 channels and CCK-A receptors (CCKar) expressed in vagal afferents are upregulated in models of visceral inflammation. The present study investigated whether T3-SCI attenuates peripheral vagal afferent sensitivity through plasticity of TRPV1 and CCK receptors."

Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury."

Our aim was to standardize an animal model that can be useful in studying this condition. After standardizing the animal model in a pilot study, 26 female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal cord transection at the level of T10 vertebra. Four animals were subjected to cystometrogram (CMG) 24 hr after spinalization and six rats 3 weeks post-spinalization. These CMGs were compared to that of six normal controls. The detailed description of the model presented in this manuscript, is the final result after several modifications. All the animals consistently developed hyperreflexia after an initial period of spinal shock phase. Expressed volume of urine continued to decrease until it reached a plateau after peaking at 1-week post-spinalization. The attrition rate reached 27.3% after several improvements in the animal model and was mostly from self-inflicted injuries. Post-operative complications included hypothermia, decubitus ulcers, hematuria, urinary tract infection in addition to the unexplained death of two animals. In conclusion, we believe that this animal model closely resembles the clinical condition of hyperreflexia and follows similar course. The relative low cost of this animal model and the easy maintenance makes it a valuable tool to study such a condition."

Moderate and severe (impactor height: 6.25 or 12.5 mm) contusion was induced at midline C3-4 spinal cord in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The ventilatory behaviors of unanesthetized were evaluated by whole body plethysmography at 1 day and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-injury. The tidal volume was decreased and frequency was increased in contused animals compared with uninjured animals at the acute injury state. At 8 weeks post-injury, respiratory frequency was similar between groups; however, contused animals had lower tidal volume. The pulmonary chemoreflex induced by intrajugular capsaicin (1.5 mu g/kg) injection and the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex induced by increasing positive end-expired pressure (9 cm H2O) were evoked in anesthetized animals at 3 days, or 2 or 8 weeks post-surgery. The result showed that capsaicin induced a significant prolongation of the expiratory duration in uninjured animals; however, this response was greatly attenuated in contused animals at 3 days post-injury. Increased positive end-expired pressure also caused an increase in the expiratory duration in uninjured and moderately contused animals; however, severely contused animals exhibited an attenuated response. At 2 and 8 weeks post-injury, both the pulmonary chemoreflex and the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex were similar between uninjured and contused animals. These data suggested that midcervical contusion can cause a long-term respiratory impairment and a transiently attenuation of vagal-mediated respiratory reflexes."

Systemic treatment with capsaicin is known to reduce this subpopulation in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of neonatal rats. To better understand the effects of capsaicin on adult afferent fibers, we examined DRG neurons retrogradely labeled by an i.p. injection of Fast Blue (FB) administered 3, 30, or 60 days after systemic capsaicin treatment (125 mg/kg i.p.). FB labeling in the 12th and 13th thoracic DRG was dramatically reduced 3 and 30 days post capsaicin (50% and 35% of control, respectively). However, the number of retrogradely labeled neurons rose to 65% of control by 60 days post capsaicin. In addition to FB labeling, we quantified the immunoreactivity of NR1, the obligatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit, and Na(v)1.8, a DRG-specific sodium channel, in FB-labeled neurons as well as mRNA levels for both proteins in the 5th and 6th lumbar DRG. NR1 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression followed a pattern of early reduction and subsequent partial restoration similar to FB labeling. Na(v)1.8 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression dropped to approximately 50% of control at 3 days post capsaicin but completely recovered by 60 days.

It was hypothesized that noxious stimulation has this effect because it engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers that produce a state of over-excitation in central pathways. The present article explored this issue by assessing the effect of capsaicin, which activates C-fibers that express the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1). Rats received a lower thoracic (T11) contusion injury and capsaicin was applied to one hind paw the next day. For comparison, other animals received noxious electrical stimulation at an intensity that engages C fibers. Both forms of stimulation elicited similar levels of c-fos mRNA expression, a cellular marker of nociceptive activation, and impaired long-term behavioral recovery. Cellular assays were then performed to compare the acute effect of shock and capsaicin treatment. Both forms of noxious stimulation increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-3, which promotes apoptotic cell death. Shock, but not capsaicin, enhanced expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death [caspase-1, inteleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)]. Pyroptosis has been linked to the activation of the P2X7 receptor and the outward flow of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the pannexin-1 channel. Blocking the P2X7 receptor with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) reduced the expression of signals related to pyroptotic cell death in contused rats that had received shock. Blocking the pannexin-1 channel with probenecid paradoxically had the opposite effect. BBG enhanced long-term recovery and lowered reactivity to mechanical stimulation applied to the girdle region (an index of chronic pain), but did not block the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation. The results suggest that C-fiber input after injury impairs long-term recovery and that this effect may arise because it induces apoptotic cell death."

The present study examined whether the pulmonary chemoreflex can recover during the chronic injury phase and investigated the role of bronchopulmonary C-fibers on the altered breathing pattern after C2Hx. In the first protocol, bronchopulmonary C-fibers were excited by intrajugular capsaicin administration in uninjured and complete C2Hx animals 8 wk postsurgery. Capsaicin evoked pulmonary chemoreflexes in both groups, but the reflex intensity was significantly weaker in C2Hx animals. To examine whether spared spinal white matter tissue contributes to pulmonary chemoreflex recovery, the reflex was evaluated in animals with different extents of lateral injury. Linear regression analyses revealed that tidal volume significantly correlated with the extent of spared tissue; however, capsaicin-induced apnea was not related to injury severity when the ipsilateral-to-contralateral white matter ratio was <50%. In the second protocol, the influence of background bronchopulmonary C-fiber activity on respiration was investigated by blocking C-fiber conduction via perivagal capsaicin treatment. The rapid shallow breathing of C2Hx animals persisted after perivagal capsaicin treatment despite attenuation of pulmonary chemoreflexes. These results indicate that the pulmonary chemoreflex can recover to some extent following spinal injury, but remains attenuated even when there is moderate spinal tissue sparing, and that altered breathing pattern of C2Hx animals cannot be attributed to endogenous activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibers."

The ipsilateral phrenic activity can partially recover over weeks to months following injury due to the activation of latent crossed spinal pathways and exhibits a greater capacity to increase activity during respiratory challenges than the contralateral phrenic nerve. However, whether the bilateral phrenic nerves demonstrate differential responses to respiratory inhibitory inputs is unclear. Accordingly, the present study examined bilateral phrenic bursting in response to capsaicin-induced pulmonary chemoreflexes, a robust respiratory inhibitory stimulus. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated adult rats at 8-9 weeks after C2 hemisection (C2Hx) or C2 laminectomy. Intra-jugular capsaicin (1.5 mu g kg(-1)) injection was performed to activate the bronchopulmonary C-fibres to evoke pulmonary chemoreflexes. The present results indicate that capsaicin-induced prolongation of expiratory duration was significantly attenuated in C2Hx animals. However, ipsilateral phrenic activity was robustly reduced after capsaicin treatment compared to uninjured animals. Single phrenic fibre recording experiments demonstrated that C2Hx animals had a higher proportion of late-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons that were relatively sensitive to capsaicin treatment compared to early-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons. Moreover, late-inspiratory phrenic motoneurons in C2Hx animals had a weaker discharge frequency and slower recovery time than uninjured animals. These results suggest bilateral phrenic nerves differentially respond to bronchopulmonary C-fibre activation following unilateral cervical hemisection, and the severe inhibition of phrenic bursting is due to a shift in the discharge pattern of phrenic motoneurons."

This capacity for learning is modulated by prior stimulation; both variable shock and inflammation produce a lasting inhibition of learning. An extended exposure to fixed spaced shock has no adverse effect on learning and opposes the consequences of variable shock. The present studies expand on these findings and demonstrate that fixed stimulation ameliorates the impact of peripheral inflammation. Spinally transected rats were administered 900 fixed spaced legshocks before (Experiment 1) or 1,800 legshocks after (Experiment 2) a subcutaneous hindpaw injection of capsaicin.

At 21 days after SCI, the urine volume per micturition was significantly increased. The number of full erectile events decreased significantly following SCI. Pressure wave analyses demonstrated increased AUC, increased maximum pressures, increased suprasystolic peak duration, increased AUC of the suprasystollic peaks, and increased maximum pressures of the suprasystolic peaks during recovery.

If shock is delivered whenever the leg is extended (controllable stimulation), it induces an increase in flexion duration that minimizes net shock exposure. This learning is not observed in subjects that receive the same amount of shock independent of leg position (uncontrollable stimulation). These two forms of stimulation have a lasting, and divergent, effect on subsequent learning: controllable stimulation enables learning whereas uncontrollable stimulation disables it (learning deficit). Uncontrollable stimulation also enhances mechanical reactivity. We review evidence that training with controllable stimulation engages a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent process that can both prevent and reverse the consequences of uncontrollable shock. We relate these effects to changes in BDNF protein and TrkB signaling. Controllable stimulation is also shown to counter the effects of peripheral inflammation (from intradermal capsaicin). A model is proposed that assumes nociceptive input is gated at an early sensory stage. This gate is sensitive to current environmental relations (between proprioceptive and nociceptive input), allowing stimulation to be classified as controllable or uncontrollable. We further propose that the status of this gate is affected by past experience and that a history of uncontrollable stimulation will promote the development of neuropathic pain."

The current studies demonstrate that capsaicin also undermines the adaptive plasticity of the spinal cord, rendering the system incapable of learning a simple instrumental task. In these studies, male rats are transected at the second thoracic vertebra and are tested 24 to 48 hours later, During testing, subjects receive shock to one hindleg when it is extended (controllable stimulation). Rats quickly learn to maintain the leg in a flexed position. Rats that have been injected with capsaicin (1% or 3%) in the hindpaw fail to learn, even when tested on the leg contralateral to the injection. This learning deficit lasts at least 24 hours. Interestingly, training with controllable electrical stimulation prior to capsaicin administration protects the spinal cord against the maladaptive effects. Rats pretrained with controllable stimulation do not display a learning deficit or tactile allodynia. Moreover, controllable stimulation, combined with naltrexone, reverses the capsaicin-induced deficit. These data suggest that peripheral inflammation, accompanying spinal cord injuries, might have an adverse effect on recovery."

In normal cats, capsaicin elicited a transient increase in the frequency of isovolumetric bladder contractions and reduced the volume threshold for inducing micturition, but did not depress the amplitude of bladder contractions or the reflex firing on bladder nerves. In anesthetized SCI cats, capsaicin depressed reflex bladder activity and firing on bladder nerves. In awake SCI cats, capsaicin initially decreased the volume threshold for inducing micturition; however, after a delay of 3-6 h the volume threshold increased and intravesical voiding pressure decreased. This effect persisted for 4-12 days. It is concluded that capsaicin-sensitive C fiber bladder afferents are not involved in initiating reflex micturition in normal cats, but play an essential role in triggering automatic micturition in chronic SCI cats. The results are consistent with the clinical data indicating that C fiber bladder afferents contribute to bladder hyperactivity and incontinence in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction."

EUS striated and urethral smooth muscle activities were elicited by reflex isovolumetric bladder contractions evoked by bladder filling or electrical stimulation of nerves in the bladder wall. Evoked EUS bursting activity in normal rats was eliminated in chronic spinal rats and replaced by tonic activity. Reflex urethral smooth muscle activity mediated by an increase in urethral pressure after paralysis of the EUS with alpha-bungarotoxin occurred in normal and chronic spinal rats. The response was significantly larger in chronic spinal (21.3+/-3.0 cmH(2)O) than in normal rats (4.2+/-0.7 cmH(2)O). N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 20 mg/kg iv) increased the smooth muscle response in normal (5.9+/-1.3 cmH(2)O) and chronic spinal rats (6.9+/-1.8 cmH(2)O). This increase in urethral pressure was not changed by sympathetic nerve transection or prazosin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg iv) but was abolished by hexamethonium and reduced 74-89% by atropine. These results indicate that coordinated EUS function (bursting activity) in the male rat is dependent on supraspinal pathways and that the urethral smooth muscle response during voiding is composed of a predominant cholinergic, atropine-sensitive contraction as well as a nitric oxide-mediated relaxation. Both are mediated by activation of parasympathetic pathways and are maintained or significantly larger after spinal cord injury, indicating that they are dependent on spinal reflex pathways."

Rats received modified-moderate contusion injuries at T8/9, and 9 days later, Fb-BDNF/NT3 or unmodified fibroblasts (OP-controls) were delivered into the cord. Fb-BDNF/NT3 rats recovered froth areflexic bladder earlier, showed decreased micturition pressure and fewer episodes of detrusor hyperreflexia, compared to OP-controls. There were also improvements in hindlimb function in the Fb-BDNF/NT3 group although locomotion on a more challenging substrate (grid) and tail withdrawal latency in response to a thermal stimulus showed persisting deficits, little recovery, and no differences between the groups. Immunocytochemistry at L6-S1 revealed changes in density of afferent and descending projections to L6-S1 cord. The density of small dorsal root axons increased in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn in OP-controls but not in Fb-BDNF/NT3, suggesting sprouting of primary afferents following injury that was inhibited by Fb-BDNF/NT-3. In contrast, the trophic factor secreting transplants stimulated sprouting and/or sparing of descending modulatory pathways projecting to the lumbosacral spinal cord. No differences in synaptophysin immunoreactivity were seen in the dorsal horn which suggested that synaptic density was similar but achieved by sprouting of different systems in the two operated groups. Fb-BDNF/NT3 transplanted into injured spinal cord thus improved both bladder and hindlimb function, and this was associated with reorganization of spinal circuitry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Literature review of anatomical, immunohistochemical, and pharmacologic studies of normal and dysfunctional bladder afferent pathways. Results: Studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through coordination centers (periaqueductal gray and pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brain stem. This reflex pathway, which is activated by small myelinated (A delta) bladder afferent nerves, is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Spinal cord injury at cervical or thoracic levels disrupts voluntary voiding, as well as the normal reflex pathways that coordinate bladder and sphincter function. Following spinal cord injury, the bladder is initially areflexic but then becomes hyperreflexic due to the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. The recovery of bladder function after spinal cord injury is dependent in part on the plasticity of bladder afferent pathways and the unmasking of reflexes triggered by unmyelinated, capsaicin-sensitive, C-fiber bladder afferent neurons. Plasticity is associated with morphologic, chemical, and electrical changes in bladder afferent neurons and appears to be mediated in part by neurotrophic factors released in the spinal cord and the peripheral target organs. Conclusions: Spinal cord injury at sites remote from the lumbosacral spinal cord can indirectly influence properties of bladder afferent neurons by altering the function and chemical environment in the bladder or the spinal cord.

Cystometry and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography were performed on 2 consecutive days after induction of urethane anesthesia in SCI rats 6-8 weeks after spinal cord injury. SCI rats exhibited voiding abnormalities including: non-voiding contractions (NVCs) before micturition, increased volume threshold (VT) for initiating voiding, increased amplitude and duration of voiding contractions, decreased voiding efficiency, increased residual urine, and changes in the pattern of the EUS-EMG. In SCI rats, the EUS electromyogram (EUS-EMG) consisted of more prominent tonic activity, shorter periods of bursting activity, and a reduction in the ratio of silent to active periods during bursting. These changes were more prominent during deeper levels of anesthesia on day 1. Capsaicin (125 mg/kg, s.c., 4 days before urodynamic examination) reduced VT and the number of NVCs, decreased the amplitude and duration of voiding contractions, partially normalized the pattern of EUS-EMG activity, and improved the voiding efficiency on day 1 after induction of anesthesia but not on day 2. Capsaicin treatment increased the percentage of animals (from 55% to 80%) that voided on day 1. The results indicate that capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber bladder afferents are not essential for reflex micturition in SCI rats. However, these afferents do contribute to overactivity of the bladder and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in deeply anesthetized SCI rats. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This neural system coordinates the activity of two functional units in the lower urinary tract: (1) a reservoir (the urinary bladder) and (2) an outlet (consisting of bladder neck, urethra and striated muscles of the pelvic floor). During urine storage the outlet is closed and the bladder is quiescent, thereby maintaining a low intravesical pressure over a wide range of bladder volumes. During micturition the outlet relaxes and the bladder contracts to promote the release of urine. This reciprocal relationship between bladder and outlet is generated by visceral reflex circuits, some of which are under voluntary control. Experimental studies in animals indicate that the micturition reflex is mediated by a spinobulbospinal pathway passing through a coordination center (the pontine micturition center) located in the rostral brainstem.

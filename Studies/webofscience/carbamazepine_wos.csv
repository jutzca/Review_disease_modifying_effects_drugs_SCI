Such pain frequently impedes functional recovery and leads to significant physical and psychological disability. While the treatment of CPS with antidepressant or anticonvulsant medication has been investigated, the treatment with a combination of these two classes of medications has not been studied. We report four separate cases of patients with paralysis and associated burning dysesthesias who had substantial improvement following a short course of treatment with a combination of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and carbamazepine. Each patient suffered significant discomfort resulting in loss of sleep or interference with functional abilities. These patients were treated with a therapeutic dose of a TCA alone without subjective improvement in pain. Subsequently, carbamazepine was added without changing the TCA dose. Each patient responded favorably to this combination of medications and reported a minimum of 50% reduction in pain within two to three days of adding the carbamazepine. Two patients had complete resolution of pain. When the antidepressant was later discontinued in two patients, the dysesthesias significantly increased in both patients. The combination of a TCA and carbamazepine may improve the functional status and quality of life for patients with CPS unresponsive to either medication alone."

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects.PurposeThe aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury.MethodsThis was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort.ResultsOf the cohort (n=570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p=0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p=0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p=0.82 in propensity-matched cohort).ConclusionNon-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes."

Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC50 of 2 mu M. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 mu M BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K-d = 170 mu M) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K-d = 5 mu M) and even more tightly Downloaded from molpharm. aspetjournals. org at Thomson Scientific on July 15, 2011 (K-d = 0.2 mu M) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 mu M. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels."

Perfusion of the spinal cord in 0-Ca2+ Ringer solution resulted in significantly improved recovery of the compound action potential. Similarly, removal of Na+ from the perfusate resulted in significantly improved recovery of conduction in dorsal column axons. Exposure of the anoxic spinal cord to the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), the Na-Ca exchange blockers benzamil and bepridil, Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride and harmaline, and perfusion in Ringer solution with pH adjusted to 6.4, all resulted in improved recovery. The tertiary anesthetics procaine and lidocaine, as well as phenytoin and carbamazepine, also resulted in improved recovery of compound action potential amplitude after 60 min of anoxia. These results demonstrate that a significant component of irreversible loss of conduction, following anoxic injury of the dorsal columns, is Ca2+-dependent. Moreover, these results demonstrate that TTX-inhibitable Na+ channels participate in the pathophysiology of anoxic injury in spinal cord white matter, and indicate that reverse Na-Ca exchange provides a route for at least part of the damaging influx of Ca2+ into an intracellular compartment in anoxic spinal cord white matter. Our results also suggest that extracellular acidosis may have a protective effect on anoxic spinal cord white matter, and support the hypothesis that anoxic injury of spinal cord white matter may involve the Na+-H+ exchanger."

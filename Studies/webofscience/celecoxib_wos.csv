The title compounds were synthesized by conventional methods in good yields and subsequently tested for inhibitory activity against COX-1/COX-2. The most potent COX-2 inhibitor among the tested derivatives was further assayed for protective effect against experimental SCI of Sprague-Dawley rats. The designed compounds showed considerable inhibition of COX-2 as compared to COX -1 revealing compound 7m as most potent inhibitor of COX-2 isoenzyme (IC50 = 0.04 mu M). The expression of mitochondrial apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 and Bax) together with COX-2 and iNOS was restored near to normal as evidenced by western blot analysis in SCI rats. Taken altogether, compound 7m was identified as most potent inhibitor of COX-2. It also showed protective action against SCI via attenuation of COX-2, oxidative stress and apoptosis and inflammation in Male Sprague-Dawley rats."

Although disease-modifying strategies are an unmet need in these disorders, lately, (pre)clinical studies suggested favorable effects after an intervention with bone marrow-derived stromal cells (bm-SC). Recent interventions with intrathecal transplantation of these cells in preclinical rodent models improved the functional outcome and reduced the inflammation, but not anti-inflammatory drugs. The benefit of bm-SCs was demonstrated in rats with an acute (traumatic spinal cord injury, tSCI) and in mice with a chronic [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like FUS 1-358 or SOD1-G93-A mutation] neurodegenerative process. Bm-SCs, were found to modify underlying disease processes, to reduce final clinical SCI-related outcome, and to slow down ALS-like clinical progression. After double-blind interventions with bm-SC transplantations, Vehicle (placebo), and (non)steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Methylprednisolone, Riluzole, Celecoxib), clinical, histological and histochemical findings, serum/spinal cytokines, markers for spinal microglial activation inclusive, evidenced the cell-to-cell action of bm-SCs in both otherwise healthy and immune-deficient tSCI-rats, as well as wild-type and FUS/SOD1-transgenic ALS-like mice. The multi-pathway hypothesis of the cell-to-cell action of bmSCs, presumably using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers of messages in the form of RNAs, DNA, proteins, and lipids rather than influencing a single inflammatory pathway, could be justified by the reported differences of cytokines and other chemokines in the serum and spinal tissue. The mode of action of bm-SCs is hypothesized to be associated with its dedicated adjustment of the pro-apoptotic glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta level towards an anti-apoptotic level whereas their multi-pathway hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as the level of the marker of activated microglia, ionized calcium binding adapter (Iba)-1 level."

The therapeutic effects of ROCK on nervous system diseases might be enhanced by COX-2 inhibitors. This study investigated the synergistic effect of the combined use of the ROCK inhibitor fasudil and a COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib on spinal cord injury in a rat model established by transecting the right half of the spinal cord at T-11. Rat models were orally administrated with celecoxib (20 mg/kg) and/or intramuscularly with fasudil (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Results demonstrated that the combined use of celecoxib and fasudil significantly decreased COX-2 and Rho kinase II expression surrounding the lesion site in rats with spinal cord injury, improved the pathomorphology of the injured spinal cord, and promoted the recovery of motor function. Moreover, the effects of the drug combination were better than celecoxib or fasudil alone. This study demonstrated that the combined use of fasudil and celecoxib synergistically enhanced the functional recovery of injured spinal cord in rats."

Industrial workers exposed to ACR have been reported to suffer from a variety of central and peripheral neuropathological symptoms including numbness of hands and feet, skin peeling and muscular weakness of legs. These reports suggest that the body burden of ACR may be a risk factor in recovery patterns following neurotrauma. The present study was designed to assess the effect of ACR on neurological recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats."

Eight weeks after the treatment with streptozotocin the animals were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate and laminectomy was performed at T 7-8 level leaving the dura intact. A compression plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) loaded with a weight of 35 g was placed on the exposed spinal cord for 5 min, Postoperative neurological function was assessed using inclined plane test, modified Tarlov score, and vocal and sensory score daily for 10 days, Electrophysiological changes were assessed using somatosensory and corticomotor evoked-potentials, The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals and injured site of the spinal cord was analyzed for changes in vitamin E and glutathione levels (as markers of oxidative stress), Pathological changes in spinal cord were also studied using light microscopy, The data on neurobehavioral study clearly indicated that the compression of spinal cord produced highly significant neurological deficit and poor recovery in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats, Our histopathological and electrophysiological results also confirmed that diabetic animals are more susceptible to compressive spinal cord injury as compared to nondiabetic animals, A higher depletion of antioxidant defense markers (vitamin E and glutathione) was observed in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats, These results point toward the role of free radicals in poor recovery in diabetic rats following neurotrauma, Further studies are warranted to assess the neuroprotective potential of antioxidants to retard the secondary pathophysiological events following neurotrauma and to enhance the recovery."

Experiments were conducted on C-2 spinal cord-hemisected, anesthetized (chloral hydrate, 400 mg/kg ip), vagotomized, pancuronium-paralyzed, and artificially ventilated female Sprague-Dawley rats in which CO2 levels were monitored and maintained. Twenty-four hours after spinal hemisection, the ipsilateral phrenic nerve displayed no respiratory-related activity indicative of a functionally complete hemisection. Intravenous administration of the 5-HT2A/2C-receptor agonist (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) induced respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection under conditions in which CO2 was maintained at constant levels and augmented the activity induced under conditions of hypercapnia. The effects of DOI were found to be dose dependent, and the recovery of activity could be maintained for up to 2 h after a single injection. DOI-induced recovery was attenuated by the 5-HT2-receptor antagonist ketanserin but not with the 5-HT2C-receptor antagonist RS-102221, suggesting that 5-HT2A and not necessarily 5-HT2C receptors may be involved in the induction of respiratory recovery after cervical spinal cord injury."

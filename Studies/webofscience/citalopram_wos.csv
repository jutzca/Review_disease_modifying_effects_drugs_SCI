Here, we tested the efficacy of both 7-day and 8-week citalopram treatment in a contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) rat model. A combination of behavioral tests, histological and serum cytokine analysis was used to assess overall recovery. Despite promoting a mild reduction of inflammatory cells as well as an early, but transient increase of specific serum cytokines, citalopram administration showed no overall beneficial effects on motor performance or lesion extension. Our results do not support citalopram treatment as a therapeutic strategy for SCI."

Spinal motoneurons become hyperexcitable after SCI, but the plastic responses of locomotor network interneurons (INs) after SCI have not been studied. Using an adult mouse SCI model, we analyzed the effects of complete spinal cord lesions on the intrinsic electrophysiological properties, excitability, and neuromodulatory responses to serotonin (5-HT) in mouse lumbar V2a spinal INs, which help regulate left-right alternation during locomotion. Four weeks after SCI, V2a INs showed almost no changes in baseline excitability or action potential properties; the only parameter that changed was a reduced input resistance. However, V2a INs became 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive to 5-HT. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that SCI caused a coordinated loss of serotonergic fibers and the 5-HT transporter (SERT). Blocking the SERT with citalopram in intact mice did not increase 5-HT sensitivity to the level seen after SCI. SCI also evoked an increase in 5-HT2C receptor cluster number and intensity, suggesting that several plastic changes cooperate in increasing 5-HT sensitivity. Our results suggest that different components of the spinal neuronal network responsible for coordinating locomotion are differentially affected by SCI, and highlight the importance of understanding these changes when considering therapies targeted at functional recovery."

Constitutively active 5-HT2/alpha(1) receptors facilitate muscle spasms after human spinal cord injury. J Neurophysiol 109: 1473-1484, 2013. First published December 5, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00821.2012.-In animals, the recovery of motoneuron excitability in the months following a complete spinal cord injury is mediated, in part, by increases in constitutive serotonin (5-HT2) and norepinephrine (alpha(1)) receptor activity, which facilitates the reactivation of calcium-mediated persistent inward currents (CaPICs) without the ligands serotonin and norepinephrine below the injury. In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/alpha(1) receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and alpha(1) receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal."

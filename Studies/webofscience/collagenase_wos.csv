Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) plays critical roles in the inflammatory response by negatively regulating cytokine-Jak-Stat signaling. However, the role of SOCS3 in the regulation of macrophage polarization is highly controversial and the fine regulation exerted by SOCS3 needs further understanding. In this study, rat ICH models were established by infusion of collagenase into the caudate nucleus. To decrease SOCS3 expression into microglia/macrophages in the hemorrhagic lesion area, we injected lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shSOCS3) (Lenti-shSOCS3) into the hematoma cavity at 24 h following ICH. We found that the number of iNOS-positive cells (M1 phenotype) was significantly reduced, whereas arginase-1-positive cells (M2 phenotype) were markedly elevated in animals that received Lenti-shSOCS3 injections compared with those in the Lenti-EGFP and saline groups. The increase in arginase-1-positive cells was associated with a significantly lower pro-inflammatory microenvironment, which included the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha] and concurrent upregulation of anti-inflammatory (IL-10) mediators. In addition, this marked shift toward the M2 phenotype was associated with suppressed NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, these changes notably enhanced the neuroprotective effects and functional recovery in Lenti-shSOCS3-injected animals. Our findings indicated that reduction in SOCS3 expression caused a marked bias toward the M2 phenotype and ameliorated the inflammatory microenvironment, which enhanced neuroprotective effects and resulted in notable improvement in functional recovery after ICH."

Here we consider the mechanisms that may be contributing to hemorrhage-induced damage and discuss the utility of a new model of spinal cord hemorrhage, which was urgently required as most of our current understanding has been extrapolated from intracerebral hemorrhage studies."

Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) decomposes chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the glial scar that forms following SCI, allowing stem cells to penetrate through the scar and promote recovery of nerve function. This study aimed to establish ADSCs that stably express ChABC (ChABC-ADSCs) and evaluate the migratory capability of ChABC-ADSCs in vitro."

Macrophage is the major executor in the neuroinflammation and initiates neurological defects. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) delivers inhibitory signals that regulate the balance between T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology. PD-1 expression by macrophages plays a pathologic role in the innate inflammatory response. However, the exact role of PD-1 on inflammatory responses following ICH has not been well identified. In this experiment, PD-1 KO (PD-1 -/-) ICH mice and Wild-type (WT) ICH mice were caused by intracranial injection of type IV collagenase. The level of macrophage activation, inflammatory cytokines and fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl-2) were detected using immunofluorescence staining and ELISA assays. In addition, brain edema and neurological scores of ICH mice were also measured. Our data demonstrated that ICH promoted PD-1 expression of macrophage and enhanced inflammatory cytokines and Fgl-2 concentrations. PD-1 -/- mice exhibited significantly higher expression of the inflammatory cytokines which initiate Fgl-2, than did their wild-type (WT) littermates. As a result, macrophage activation, cerebral edema and neurological deficit scores of PD-1 -/- mice were higher. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PD-1 plays a vital role in brain inflammation via regulation of Fgl-2 after ICH, and that manipulation of PD-1 might be a promising therapeutical target in ICH.

The extent of any hemorrhage within the injured cord is also known to be associated with the formation of intraparenchymal cavities and has been anecdotally linked to secondary damage. This study was designed to examine the contribution of blood components to the outcome of spinal-cord injury. We stereotaxically microinjected collagenase, which causes localized bleeding, into the spinal cord to model the hemorrhage associated with spinal cord injury in the absence of significant mechanical trauma. Tissue damage was observed at the collagenase injection site over time, and was associated with localized disruption of the blood-spinal-cord barrier, neuronal cell death, and the recruitment of leukocytes. The magnitude of the bleed was related to neutrophil mobilization. Interestingly, the collagenase-induced injury also provoked extended axonal damage. With this model, the down-stream effects of hemorrhage are easily discernible, and the impact of treatment strategies for spinal-cord injury on hemorrhage-related injury can be evaluated.

This CSPG-containing glial scar inhibits axonal regeneration. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade CSPGs and other inhibitory proteins to promote neurite outgrowth. Increased MMP synthesis and secretion are observed in fibroblasts adjacent to tumor cells that express the protein EMMPRIN (Extracellular Matrix MetalloPRoteinase INducer). EMMPRIN transduction of cells provides an avenue to deliver increased levels of MMPs to the site of SCI in a sustained, localized, and moderate fashion. We explored the use of EMMPRIN-transduced cells as a mechanism to degrade CSPGs, facilitate axonal growth and improve recovery after SCI. Human dermal fibroblasts infected with a recombinant EMMPRIN adenovirus significantly increased secretion of MMP-3 compared to fibroblasts infected with a control adenovirus. Decreased CSPG immunoreactivity was observed in injured spinal cord sections when they were incubated with media from EMMPRIN-transduced fibroblasts. Conditioned media from EMMPRIN-transduced fibroblasts increased the length of neurites that were grown on a CSPG substrate. Rats that received contusive SCI and EMMPRIN-transduced fibroblast transplants demonstrated improved locomotor recovery compared to rats that received control fibroblasts, but not compared to other control groups. EMMPRIN-transplanted rats showed a significant increase in the number of retrogradely labeled cell bodies within brainstem nuclei and an increase in serotonergic fibers distal to the site of injury. EMMPRIN, and consequently MMP, delivery to the injured spinal cord may prove to be beneficial in reducing some of the physical barriers to axonal growth after SCI."

Gait analysis has been employed clinically in stroke patients for their rehabilitation planning. In animal studies, gait analysis has been employed for the assessment of their locomotive disturbances in ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease. The aims of the work reported here were to identify the gait parameters, collected from the computer-generated CatWalk System, that change after unilateral intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the acute stage and long term up to 56 days post-ICH. The results showed that with the collagenase-induced unilateral striatal lesion, the rats displayed a significant contralateral decrease in print and maximum contact area and paw intensity, a diagonal increase in the stance duration of the left front and right hind paws, a significant decrease in the stride length of all four limbs, and foot pattern instability as reflected by the base of support, support on styles, and cadence. These deficits, including those in print area, stance and pressure, were demonstrated throughout the long-term period following ICH. The correlations between the gait parameters, lesion volume and asymmetrical forelimb use were also reported in this paper. This work has provided a systematic description on gait parameters in the classical striatal ICH model, which might become an essential assessment tool in future studies of pathophysiology and the development of novel treatments for experimental unilateral intracerebral hemorrhage with gait deficits.

The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of fingolimod in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage. ICH was produced in adult CD1 mice by injecting collagenase VII-S (0.5 mu L, 0.06 U) into the basal ganglia. Fingolimod (or saline) was given 30 min after surgery and once daily for two days. Three days after intracerebral hemorrhage, brain edema, hematoma volume and the number of apoptotic cells were quantified. In another cohort of mice, brain atrophy was evaluated two weeks following intracerebral hemorrhage. Neurobehavioral tests were performed on the 3rd, the 7th and the 14th day. Fingolimod significantly decreased edema, apoptosis and brain atrophy. More importantly, fingolimod enhanced neurobehavioral recovery. Preliminary experiments showed no difference in the number of inflammatory (CD68-positive) cells between the two groups. In conclusion, fingolimod exerts protective effects in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage; the mechanisms underlying these neuroprotective effects deserve further study. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Exaggerated inflammation and apoptosis are two pivotal pathological processes for secondary brain injury after ICH. Quercetin, a flavonoid widely distributed in various herbs, fruits and vegetables, has been proved to improve neuronal functional recovery in spinal cord injury rats. However, the efficacy of quercetin in caring for post-ICH brain injury has not been investigated. In the present study, we established an ICH model by injecting type VII bacterial collagenase (0.5U) into the central striatum of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were randomized to four groups: sham-operation group; ICH + vehicle group; ICH + 5 mg/kg quercetin group; and ICH + 50 mg/kg quercetin group. The expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the brain tissue were assayed by Real-time PCR, ELISA and Western Blot, and cell apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL and caspase-3 staining 3 days after model establishment. It was found that the lesion volume, the brain water content, the expression levels of the four inflammation markers and the number of apoptotic cells were reduced significantly in ICH rats receiving quercetin, especially in 50 mg/kg quercetin group. These results confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in repairing brain injury, probably by inhibiting inflammatory response and apoptosis, thus promoting nerve functional restoration."

MMPs have a specific cellular and temporal pattern of expression in the injured spinal cord. Here we consider their diverse functions in the acutely injured cord and during wound healing. Excessive activity of MMPs, and in particular gelatinase B (MMP-9), in the acutely injured cord contributes to disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, and the influx of leukocytes into the injured cord, as well as apoptosis. MMP-9 and MMP-2 regulate inflammation and neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury and may contribute to SCI-induced pain. Early pharmacologic inhibition of MMPs or the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) results in an improvement in long-term neurological recovery and is associated with reduced glial scarring and neuropathic pain. During wound healing, gelatinase A (MMP-2) plays a critical role in limiting the formation of an inhibitory glial scar, and mice that are genetically deficient in this protease showed impaired recovery. Together, these findings illustrate complex, temporally distinct roles of MMPs in SCIs. As early gelatinase activity is detrimental, there is an emerging interest in developing gelatinase-targeted therapeutics that would be specifically tailored to the acute injured spinal cord. Thus, we focus this review on the development of selective gelatinase inhibitors."

We report that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays an important role in blood-spinal cord barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and locomotor recovery. MMP-9 was present in the meninges and neurons of the uninjured cord. MMP-9 increased rapidly after a moderate contusion spinal cord injury, reaching a maximum at 24 hr, becoming markedly reduced by 72 hr, and not detectable at 7 d after injury. It was seen in glia, macrophages, neutrophils, and vascular elements in the injured spinal cord at 24 hr after injury. The natural tissue inhibitors of MMPs were unchanged over this time course. MMP-9-null mice exhibited significantly less disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, attenuation of neutrophil infiltration, and significant locomotor recovery compared with wild-type mice. Similar findings were observed in mice treated with a hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitor from 3 hr to 3 d after injury, compared with the vehicle controls. Moreover, the area of residual white matter at the lesion epicenter was significantly greater in the inhibitor-treated group. This study provides evidence that MMP-9 plays a key role in abnormal vascular permeability and inflammation within the first 3 d after spinal cord injury, and that blockade of MMPs during this critical period attenuates these vascular events and leads to improved locomotor recovery. Our findings suggest that early inhibition of MMPs may be an efficacious strategy for the spinal cord-injured patient."

In this study, we utilized the tetracycline-regulatable Tet-On 3G system to control the expression of c-Jun, which is a common regulator of multiple NTFs in Schwann cells (SCs). In vitro, Tet-On/c-Jun-modified SCs showed a tightly controllable secretion of multiple NTFs, including glial cell line-derived NTF, nerve growth factor, brain-derived NTF, and artemin, by the addition or removal of doxycycline (Dox). When Tet-On/c-Jun-transduced SCs were grafted in vivo, the expression of NTFs could also be regulated by oral administration or removal of Dox. Fluoro-Gold retrograde tracing results indicated that a biphasic NTF expression scheme (Dox+3/-9, NTFs were up-regulated for 3 wk and declined to physiologic levels for another 9 wk) achieved more axonal regeneration than continuous up-regulation of NTFs (Dox+12) or no NTF induction (Dox-12). More importantly, the Dox+3/-9-group animals showed much better functional recovery than the animals in the Dox+12 and Dox-12 groups. Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated drug-controllable expression of multiple NTFs in nerve repair cells both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide new hope for developing an optimal therapeutic alternative for nerve repair through the time-restricted release of multiple NTFs using Tet-On/c-Jun-modified SCs.-Huang, L., Xia, B., Shi, X., Gao, J., Yang, Y., Xu, F., Qi, F., Liang, C., Huang, J., Luo, Z.

However, the repair capacity of SCs and the regenerative capacity of peripheral axons are limited. In the present studies we examined a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the repair capacity of SCs, and tested its efficacy in enhancing regeneration of dorsal root (DR) axons, whose regenerative capacity is particularly weak. We used male and female mice of a doxycycline-inducible transgenic line to induce expression of constitutively active ErbB2 (caErbB2) selectively in SCs after DR crush or transection. Two weeks after injury, injured DRs of induced animals contained far more SCs and SC processes. These SCs had not redifferentiated and continued to proliferate. Injured DRs of induced animals also contained far more axons that regrew along SC processes past the transection or crush site. Remarkably, SCs and axons in uninjured DRs remained quiescent, indicating that caErbB2 enhanced regeneration of injured DRs, without aberrantly activating SCs and axons in intact nerves. We also found that intraspinally expressed glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), but not the removal of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, greatly enhanced the intraspinal migration of caErbB2-expressing SCs, enabling robust penetration of DR axons into the spinal cord. These findings indicate that SC-selective, post-injury activation of ErbB2 provides a novel strategy to powerfully enhance the repair capacity of SCs and axon regeneration, without substantial off-target damage. They also highlight that promoting directed migration of caErbB2-expressing SCs by GDNF might be useful to enable axon regrowth in a non-permissive environment."

However, transplanted stem cells may not contribute to long-term recovery of the damaged CNS unless they are engineered for functional advantage. To fine tune regenerative capabilities, we developed a human neural cell line expressing L1, a regeneration-conducive adhesion molecule, under the control of a doxycycline regulatable Tet-off promoter. Controlled expression of L1 is desired because overexpression after regenerative events may lead to adverse consequences. The regulated system was tested in several cell lines, where doxycycline completely eliminated green fluorescent protein or L1 expression by 3-5 days in vitro. Increased colony formation as well as decreased proliferation were observed in H9NSCs without doxycycline (hL1-on). To test the role of L1 in vivo after acute compression spinal cord injury of immunosuppressed mice, quantum dot labeled hL1-on or hL1-off cells were injected at three sites: lesion; proximal; and caudal. Mice transplanted with hL1-on cells showed a better Basso Mouse Scale score, when compared to those with hL1-off cells. As compared to the hL1-off versus hL1-on cell transplanted mice 6 weeks post-transplantation, expression levels of L1, migration of transplanted cells, and immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase were higher, whereas expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was lower. Results indicate that L1 expression is regulatable in human stem cells by doxycycline in a nonviral engineering approach. Regulatable expression in a prospective nonleaky Tet-off system could hold promise for therapy, based on the multifunctional roles of L1, including neuronal migration and survival, neuritogenesis, myelination, and synaptic plasticity."

We previously identified the transcription factor SOX9 as a key up-regulator of CSPG production and also demonstrated that conditional Sox9 ablation leads to decreased CSPG levels and improved recovery of hind limb function after SCI. We herein demonstrate increased neural input onto spinal neurons caudal to the lesion in spinal cord injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice as indicated by increased levels of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) compared to controls. Axonal sparing, long-range axonal regeneration and reactive sprouting were investigated as possible explanations for the increase in neural inputs caudal to the lesion and for the improved locomotor outcomes in spinal cord-injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice. Whereas retrograde tract-tracing studies failed to reveal any evidence for increased axonal sparing or for long-range regeneration in the Sox9 conditional knock out mice, anterograde tract-tracing experiments demonstrated increased reactive sprouting caudal to the lesion after SCI. Finally we demonstrate that application of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor to reduce CSPG degradation in Sox9 conditional knock out mice prevents the improvements in locomotor recovery observed in untreated Sox9 conditional knock out mice. These results suggest that improved recovery of locomotor function in Sox9 conditional knock out mice after SCI is due to increased reactive sprouting secondary to reduced CSPG levels distal to the lesion.

Efficient delivery of chondroitinase ABC to the injured mammalian spinal cord can be achieved by viral vector transgene delivery. This approach dramatically modulates injury pathology and restores sensorimotor functions. However, clinical development of this therapy is limited by a lack of ability to exert control over chondroitinase gene expression. Prior experimental gene regulation platforms are likely to be incompatible with the non-resolving adaptive immune response known to occur following spinal cord injury. Therefore, here we apply a novel immune-evasive dual vector system, in which the chondroitinase gene is under a doxycycline inducible regulatory switch, utilizing a chimeric transactivator designed to evade T cell recognition. Using this novel vector system, we demonstrate tight temporal control of chondroitinase ABC gene expression, effectively removing treatment upon removal of doxycycline. This enables a comparison of short and long-term gene therapy paradigms in the treatment of clinically-relevant cervical level contusion injuries in adult rats. We reveal that transient treatment (2.5 weeks) is sufficient to promote improvement in sensory axon conduction and ladder walking performance. However, in tasks requiring skilled reaching and grasping, only long term treatment (8 weeks) leads to significantly improved function, with rats able to accurately grasp and retrieve sugar pellets. The late emergence of skilled hand function indicates enhanced neuroplasticity and connectivity and correlates with increased density of vGlut1+ innervation in spinal cord grey matter, particularly in lamina III-IV above and below the injury. Thus, our novel gene therapy system provides an experimental tool to study temporal effects of extracellular matrix digestion as well as an encouraging step towards generating a safer chondroitinase gene therapy strategy, longer term administration of which increases neuroplasticity and recovery of descending motor control. This preclinical study could have a significant impact for tetraplegic individuals, for whom recovery of hand function is an important determinant of independence, and supports the ongoing development of chondroitinase gene therapy towards clinical application for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

In the present study, we investigated whether the expression of genes transferred into the central nervous system by ex vivo gene therapy can be regulated in vivo leading to controlled neuronal survival and axonal growth. Primary rat fibroblasts were transfected with a retrovirus containing a tetracycline responsive promoter for the expression of the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) or green fluorescent protein as a control (GFP). After lesions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, NGF-mediated neuronal rescue and axonal growth could be completely controlled over a P-week period by the addition or removal of the tetracycline modulator doxycycline in the animals' drinking wafer. Further, continued expression of the reporter gene GFP could be reliably and repeatedly turned on and off in the injured CNS for at least 3 months post-grafting, the longest time point investigated These data constitute the first report of regulated neuronal rescue and axonal growth by controlled neurotrophin gene delivery and long-term, regulated expression using ex vivo CNS gene therapy."

Reducing the extent of progressive tissue loss ('neuroprotection') following SCI should result in a better recovery from SCI, but treatment options have thus far been limited. In this study, we have tested the efficacy of minocycline in ameliorating damage following acute SCI in mice. This semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic has been reported to inhibit the expression and activity of several mediators of tissue injury, including inflammatory, cytokines, free radicals and matrix metalloproteinases, making it a suitable candidate for study. Mice were subjected to extradural compression of the spinal cord using a modified aneurysm clip, following which they received treatment with either minocycline or vehicle beginning I h after injury. Behavioural testing of hindlimb function was initiated 3 days after injury using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, and at 1 week using the inclined plane test. Functional assessments demonstrated that minocycline administration significantly improved both hindlimb function and strength from 3 to 28 days after injury compared with vehicle controls. Furthermore, gross lesion size in the spinal cord was significantly reduced by minocycline, and there was evidence of axonal sparing as determined using fluorogold labelling of the rubrospinal tract and by Bielchowsky silver stain. Finally, a comparison of minocycline against the currently approved treatment for acute SCI in humans, methylprednisolone, demonstrated superior behavioural recovery in the minocycline-treated animals."

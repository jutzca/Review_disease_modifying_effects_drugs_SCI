In order to gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the anti-inflammatory effects of 17 beta-estradiol, the following endpoints of the inflammatory process were evaluated: (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score); (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity); (3) motor recovery score. In order to elucidate whether the protective effects of 17 beta-estradiol were mediated via the estrogen receptors, we investigated the effect of an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, on the protective effects of 17 beta-estradiol. ICI 182,780 (500 4g/kg administered subcutaneously 1 h prior to treatment with 17 beta-estradiol) significantly antagonized the effect of the 17 beta-estradiol and abolished the protective effect against SCI."

Differentially expressed gene (DEG) and time-series gene investigations, functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, characteristic gene-related disease analysis, and TF-target gene interaction studies were performed. A total of 122 DEGs and 409 DEGs were respectively identified in contusion SCI versus control group and complete transection versus control group, respectively. The PPI network investigated 16 characteristic genes including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and neurotensin (NTS). These genes were mainly enriched in functions involving response to ethanol, corticosterone, and estradiol. Eventually, a TF-target gene interaction network was constructed with nine TFs [including activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)] and 10 characteristic genes. The results indicate that regulation of osteoblast differentiation and positive regulation of the BMP signaling pathway may be suppressed in the process of SCI. TH may play a pivotal role in the progression of SCI. In addition, DEGs such as CRH and NTS may be novel targets for SCI therapy."

This could be due to the enormous innervation of the spinocerebellar tract from the posterior gray horn in the spinal cord to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Although the neuroprotective role of estradiol in spinal cord (SC) injuries, as well as its ability to delay secondary cell death changes, is well-known, its effect on cerebellar layers is not fully investigated. In this study, a SCI model was achieved by injection of Kainic acid into SC of adult Male Wistar rats in order to assess the effects of SCI on the cerebellum. The animals were classified into SCI group (animals with SCI), estradiol-treated group (animals with SCI and received estradiol), control groups, and sham control group. The microscopical examination 24h after induction of SCI revealed that KA induced the most characteristics of neurodegeneration including astrocytic propagation and microglial activation. The estradiol was injected intraperitoneally 20min after induction of SCI, and the samples were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30days. Histologically, the estradiol reduced the inflammatory response, enhanced the recovery of molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell layers, and therefore aided in the restoration of layer organization. These findings were also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and gene expression profiling."

In Study 1, TM (40 min/day, 5 days/week, beginning 1 week postsurgery) did not prevent SCI-induced hindlimb cancellous bone loss after 3 weeks. In Study 2, TM did not attenuate SCI-induced plantar flexor muscles atrophy nor improve locomotor recovery after 4 weeks. In our main study, SCI produced extensive distal femur and proximal tibia cancellous bone deficits, a deleterious slow-to-fast fiber-type transition in soleus, lower muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), impaired muscle force production, and levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle atrophy after 8 weeks. TE alone (7.0 mg/week) suppressed bone resorption, attenuated cancellous bone loss, constrained the soleus fiber-type transition, and prevented LABC atrophy. In comparison, TE+TM concomitantly suppressed bone resorption and stimulated bone formation after SCI, produced near-complete cancellous bone preservation, prevented the soleus fiber-type transition, attenuated soleus fCSA atrophy, maintained soleus force production, and increased LABC mass. 75% of SCI+TE+TM animals recovered voluntary over-ground hindlimb stepping, while no SCI and only 20% of SCI+TE animals regained stepping ability. Positive associations between testosterone and locomotor function suggest that TE influenced locomotor recovery. In conclusion, short-term TM alone did not improve bone, muscle, or locomotor recovery in adult rats after severe SCI, while longer-term TE+TM provided more comprehensive musculoskeletal benefit than TE alone."

Methods: All the rats underwent a T10 laminectomy. A weight-drop impact was performed using a 10-g rod from a height of 12.5 mm except the sham group. Rats with SCI were distributed into three groups randomly and then treated with tail vein injection of GIT1-BMSCs-Exos, BMSCs-Exos and PBS, respectively. The effects of GIT1-Exos on glutamate (GLU)-induced apoptosis in vitro were also evaluated by TUNEL staining. Results: The results showed that rats treated with GIT1-BMSCs-Exos had better functional behavioral recovery than those treated with PBS or BMSCs-Exos only. The overexpression of GIT1 in BMSCs-Exos not only restrained glial scar formation and neuroinflammation after SCI, but also attenuated apoptosis and promoted axonal regeneration in the injured lesion area. Neuronal cell death induced by GLU was controlled remarkably in vitro as well. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study suggested that the application of GIT1-BMSCs-Exos may provide a novel avenue for traumatic SCI treatment."

E2 (25 mu g/kg, IP) was administered to the male Wistar rats underwent contusive SCI at T10 segment. At 7 days after injury, 1 x 10(6) SCs were transplanted to the injury epicenter of the spinal cord. The groups were laminectomy, SCI, SCI+E2, and SCI+E2+SCs. Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso-Bresnahan-Beattie locomotor test. Sections from spinal cord were also assessed for histoloical staining, including Luxol fast blue, Bielschowsky's silver and immunofluorescence evaluation of myelin basic protein (MBP). The SCI group showed impaired locomotion in the hind limb, increased number of cavities within spinal cord, low observable numbers of regenerating fibers, and a significant decrease in the rate of expression for MBP. These changes were counteracted in the treatment groups (P < 0.05 vs SCI) with no significant changes among them. From the results, it may be concluded that application of E2 and SCs could be effective when axons undergo demyelination and degenerative processes, and their combination could partly provide cumulative outcomes."

Eight days after SCI, DiI-labeled SCs were transplanted into the injury epicenter in vehicle and E2-treated animals. The combinatory regimen decreased neurological and behavioral deficits and protected neurons and oligodendrocytes in comparison to vehicle rats. Moreover, E2 and SC significantly decreased the number of Iba-1+ (microglia) and GFAP(+) cells (astrocyte) in the SCI group. In addition, we found a significant reduction of mitochondrial fission-markers (Fis1) and an increase of fusion-markers (Mfn1 and Mfn2) in the injured spinal cord after E2 and SC treatment. These data demonstrated that E2 protects SCs against hypoxia-induced SCI and improves the survival of transplanted SCs."

The majority of treatment strategies after SCI have concentrated on the damaged spinal cord, for example working to reduce lesion size or spread, or encouraging regrowth of severed descending axonal projections through the lesion, hoping to re-establish synaptic connectivity with caudal targets. In our work, we have focused on a novel target for treatment after SCI, surviving spinal motoneurons and their target musculature, with the hope of developing effective treatments to preserve or restore lost function following SCI. We previously demonstrated that motoneurons, and the muscles they innervate, show pronounced atrophy after SCI. Importantly, SCI-induced atrophy of motoneuron dendrites can be attenuated by treatment with gonadal hormones, testosterone and its active metabolites, estradiol and dihydrotestosterone. Similarly, SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas can be prevented by treatment with androgens. Together, these findings suggest that regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology seen after SCI can be ameliorated by treatment with gonadal hormones, further supporting a role for steroid hormones as neurotherapeutic agents in the injured nervous system."

These impairments are precipitated by the neurological insult and resulting disuse, which has stimulated interest in activity-based physical rehabilitation therapies (ABTs) that promote neuromuscular plasticity after SCI. However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models. In this review, we discuss the (1) molecular deficits underlying muscle loss after SCI; (2) independent influences of testosterone and locomotor training on neuromuscular function and musculoskeletal integrity post-SCI; (3) hormonal and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these strategies; and (4) evidence supporting a multimodal strategy involving ABT with adjuvant testosterone, as a potential means to promote more comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal recovery than either strategy alone."

Spinal cord injured patients often arrive at the clinic hours after the initial insult. This indicates the need to study and develop treatments with a long therapeutic window of action and multiactive properties, which target the complex set of events that arise after the initial trauma. We provide evidence that tamoxifen (TAM), a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, exerts neuroprotective effects in an animal model when applied up-to 24 h after SCI. We hypothesized that continuous TAM administration will improve functional locomotor recovery by favoring myelin preservation and reducing secondary damage after SCI. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (similar to 230 g) received a moderate contusion to the thoracic (T9-T10) spinal cord, using the MASCIS impactor device. To determine the therapeutic window available for TAM treatment, rats were implanted with TAM pellets (15 mg) immediately or 24 h after SCI. Locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan open field test, grid walk, and beam crossing tests) was assessed weekly for 35 days post-injury. TAM-treated rats showed significant functional locomotor recovery and improved fine movements when treated immediately or 24 h after SCI. Further, TAM increased white matter preservation and reduced secondary damage caused by astrogliosis, axonal degeneration, and cell death after trauma. These results provide evidence for TAM as a potential therapeutic agent to treat SCI up to 24 h after the trauma."

We evaluated the proliferation of glia and the electrocorticogram in the sensorial cortex in a brain injury model. At seven days post-injury, estradiol, tamoxifen and estradiol plus tamoxifen reduced the number of resident and proliferative NG2 and reactive astrocyte vimentin+ cells. Estradiol and tamoxifen effects on NG2 cells could be produced by the classical oestrogen receptors found in these cells. The glial scar was also reduced by tamoxifen. At thirty days post-injury, the amount of resident and proliferative astrocytes increased significantly, except in the estradiol plus tamoxifen group, whilst the oligodendrocytes proliferation in the glial scar was reduced in treated animals. Tamoxifen promotes the survival of FOX-3+ neurons in the injured area and a recovery in the amplitude of electrocorticogram waves. At thirty days, estradiol did not favour the suvival of neurons but produced a greater number of reactive astrocytes. In contrast, the number of oligodendrocytes was reduced.

Thus, we examined the effects of E2 on the viability of human eyelid adipose-derived stem cells (hEASCs) in vitro with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell model and in vivo within a rat SCI model. Our results showed that E2 protected hEASCs against H2O2-induced cell death in vitro, and enhanced the survival of grafted hEASCs in vivo by reducing apoptosis. Additionally, E2 also enhanced the secretion of growth factors by hEASCs, thereby making the local microenvironment more conducive for tissue regeneration. Overall, E2 administration enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of hEASCs transplantation and facilitated motor function recovery after SCI.

Safety concerns around the use of high doses of E2 have limited clinical application, however. To address these concerns, low doses of E2 (25 mu g and 2.5 mu g) were focally delivered to the injured spinal cord using nanoparticles. A per-acute model (6 h after injury) was used to assess nanoparticle release of E2 into damaged spinal cord tissue; in addition, E2 was evaluated as a rapid anti-inflammatory. To assess inflammation, 27-plex cytokine/chemokine arrays were conducted in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal cord tissue. A particular focus was placed on IL-6, GRO-KC, and MCP-1 as these have been identified from CSF in human studies as potential biomarkers in SCI. S100 beta, an additional proposed biomarker, was also assessed in spinal cord tissue only. Tissue concentrations of E2 were double those found in the plasma, indicating focal release. E2 showed rapid anti-inflammatory effects, significantly reducing interleukin (IL)-6, GRO-KC, MCP-1, and S100 beta in one or all compartments. Numerous additional targets of rapid E2 modulation were identified including: leptin, MIP-1 alpha, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, IFN gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, etc. These data further elucidate the rapid anti-inflammatory effects E2 exerts in an acute rat SCI model, have identified additional targets of estrogen efficacy, and suggest nanoparticle delivered estrogen may provide a safe and efficacious treatment option in persons with acute SCI."

The physical trauma to the spinal cord initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generates a non-permissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Among these complex set of events are damage of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, reactive gliosis and apoptosis. The multiple events activated after SCI require a multi-active drug that could target most of these events and produce a permissive environment for cell survival, regeneration, vascular reorganization and synaptic formation. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an FDA approved drug with several neuroprotective properties that should be considered for the treatment of this devastating condition. Various investigators using different animal models and injury parameters have demonstrated the beneficial effects of this drug to improve functional locomotor recovery after SCI. Results suggest that the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen administration is to modulate anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-gliotic responses. A gap of knowledge exists regarding the sex differences in response to Tamoxifen and the therapeutic window available to administer this treatment. In addition, the effects of Tamoxifen in axonal outgrowth or synapse formation needs to be investigated. This review will address some of the mechanisms activated by Tamoxifen after SCI and the results recently published by investigators in the field."

Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 mu g 17 beta-estradiol (estrogen) for 7days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI."

After a moderate contusion injury at the 9th thoracic segment of spinal cord, E2 (300 mu g/kg) was administered by iv injection immediately after SCI, and the same dose of E2 was then administered 6 and 24 hours after injury. Our data show that E2 attenuated BSCB permeability and hemorrhage and reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and macorphages after SCI. Consistent with this finding, the expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly reduced by E2. Furthermore, E2 treatment significantly inhibited the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential melastatin 4 after injury, which are known to mediate hemorrhage at an early stage after SCI. Moreover, the expression and activation of matrix metalloprotease-9 after injury, which is known to disrupt BSCB, and the degradation of tight junction proteins, such as zona occludens-1 and occludin, were significantly inhibited by E2 treatment. Furthermore, the protective effects of E2 on BSCB disruption and functional improvement were abolished by an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182780 (3 mg/kg). Thus, our study provides evidence that the neuroprotective effect of E2 after SCI is, in part, mediated by inhibiting BSCB disruption and hemorrhage through the down-regulation of sulfonylurea receptor 1/transient receptor potential melastatin 4 and matrix metalloprotease-9, which is dependent on estrogen receptor."

To address this disparity, experimental cervical SCI models have been developed. Thus, we used a recently characterized model of cervical hemicontusion SCI in adult male rats to assess the potential therapeutic effect of post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol. Rats received a hemicontusion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra (C5) followed by administration of 17 beta-estradiol via a slow release pellet (0.5 or 5.0 mg/pellet) beginning at 30 minutes post-SCI. Behavioral evaluation of skilled and unskilled forelimb function and locomotor function were conducted for 7 weeks after SCI. Upon conclusion of the behavioral assessments, spinal cords were collected and histochemistry and stereology were conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on the lesion characteristics. We found that post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol decreased neuronal loss in the ventral horn, decreased reactive astrogliosis, decreased the immune response, and increased white mater sparing at the lesion epicenter. Additionally, post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol improved skilled forelimb function and locomotor function. Taken together, these data suggest that post-SCI administration of 17 beta-estradiol protected both the gray and white matter in cervical SCI. Moreover, this treatment improved function on skilled motor tasks that involve both gray and white matter components, suggesting that this is likely a highly clinically relevant protective strategy.

These experiments test the hypothesis that endogenous testosterone in male rats alters 17 beta-estradiol-mediated protection by evaluating a delayed administration over a clinically relevant dose range and manipulating testicular-derived testosterone. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were either gonadectomized or left gonad-intact prior to SCI. SCI was produced by a midthoracic crush injury. At 30 min post SCI, animals received a subcutaneous pellet of 0.0, 0.05, 0.5, or 5.0mg of 17 beta-estradiol, released over 21 days. Hindlimb locomotion was analyzed weekly in the open field. Spinal cords were collected and analyzed for cell death, expression of Bcl-family proteins, and white-matter sparing. Post-SCI administration of the 0.5- or 5.0-mg pellet improved hindlimb locomotion, reduced urinary bladder size, increased neuronal survival, reduced apoptosis, improved the Bax/Bcl-xL protein ratio, and increased white-matter sparing. In the absence of endogenous testicular-derived androgens, SCI induced greater apoptosis, yet 17 beta-estradiol administration reduced apoptosis to the same extent in gonadectomized and gonad-intact male rats.

Since use of high dose estrogen may have detrimental side effects and therefore may never be used in the clinic, the current study investigated the efficacy of this steroid hormone at very low doses in SCI. In particular, we tested the impact of dosing (1-10 mu g/kg), mode of delivery (intravenous vs. osmotic pump), and delay in estrogen application (15 min-4 h post-SCI) on microgliosis and neuronal death in acute SCI in rats. Treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (1-10 mu g/kg) significantly reduced microglial activation and also attenuated apoptosis of neurons compared to untreated SCI animals. The attenuation of cell death and inflammation by estrogen was observed regardless of mode and time of delivery following injury. These findings suggest estrogen as a potential agent for the treatment of individuals with SCI."

Here, we demonstrated that 17 beta-estradiol attenuates apoptosis of oligodendrocytes by inhibiting RhoA and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation after SCI. Estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and -beta were expressed in oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord, and 17 beta-estradiol treatment significantly inhibited oligodendrocyte cell death at 7 d after injury as compared with vehicle (cyclodextrin) control. 17 beta-Estradiol also attenuated caspase-3 and -9 activation at 7 d and reduced the loss of axons from progressive degeneration. In addition, 17 beta-estradiol inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were activated and peaked at 3 and/or 5 d after injury. Furthermore, administration of Rho inhibitor, PEP-1-C3 exoenzyme, inhibited RhoA and JNK3 activation, and decreased phosphorylated c-Jun level at 5 d after injury. Additionally, the attenuation of RhoA and JNK3 activation as well as oligodendrocyte cell death by 17 beta-estradiol was reversed by ER antagonist, ICI182780. Our results thus indicate that 17 beta-estradiol treatment improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing oligodendrocyte cell death via inhibition of RhoA and JNK3 activation, which were ER dependent.

We recently described in a SCI model that between 24 and 72 h post-injury, most of inflammasome components including IL-18, IL-1b, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 are upregulated. In this study, we investigated the influence of E2 treatment after spinal cord contusion on inflammasome regulation.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-a mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-a antagonist. We also observed that ER-a was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-a. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-a dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen's effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Here we show that adult female rats and mice recover significantly better than their male littermates from incomplete spinal cord injury (ISCI). This sexual dimorphism is wiped out and recovery is worse in adult mice deprived of mature T cells. After spinal cord contusion in adult rats, functional recovery ( measured by locomotor scores in an open field) was significantly worse in females treated with dihydrotestosterone prior to the injury than in placebo-treated controls, and significantly better in castrated males than in their noncastrated male littermates. Post-traumatic administration of the testosterone receptor antagonist flutamide promoted the functional recovery in adult male rats. These results, in line with the known inhibitory effect of testosterone on cell-mediated immunity, suggest that androgen-mediated immunosuppression plays a role in ISCI-related immune dysfunction and can therefore partly explain the worse outcome of ISCI in males than in female. We suggest that females, which are more prone to develop autoimmune response than males, benefit from this response in cases of CNS insults."

Two doses of 17 beta-estradiol (0.1 or 4 mg/kg) were injected i.p. immediately after spinal cord compression. Functional outcome was observed during 4 weeks following injury with two different tests. Release of cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6) was assessed 6 h, 3 days and 1 week post-injury. Reactive astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP and vimentin, and diffusion of CID68-positive inflammatory cells were examined from 3 days to 4 weeks following SCI. Treatment with 17 beta-estradiol significantly increased locomotor function from the first week until 4 weeks post-SCI. The injured spinal cord of 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats expressed more IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 than controls 6 h after injury. Moreover, 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats showed reactive astrocytes as soon as 3 days following SCI, with increased GFAP expression, smaller lesion areas and more limited diffusion of CD68-positive cells after 1 week post-injury compared to controls. The number of CD68-positive cells was also reduced in 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats one week post-SCI. However, these differences between 17 beta-estradiol-treated and control rats disappeared after 4 weeks. These results suggest that 17 beta-estradiol protects the spinal cord by stimulating early cytokines release and astroglial responses. These stimulations may prevent the area of damage from expanding and inflammatory cells to spread in the surrounding tissue during the critical first week following SCI. Although transient, these effects improved the locomotor recovery that was sustained over 4 weeks after injury. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Recent epidemiological trends suggest that SCIs in elderly women are increasing; however, the effects of menopause on estrogen-mediated neuroprotection are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17 beta-estradiol and reproductive aging on motor function, neuronal death, and white matter sparing after SCI of post- and pre-menopausal rats. Two-month-old or 1-year-old female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with a silastic capsule containing 180 mu g/mL of 17 beta-estradiol or vehicle. Complete crush SCI at T8-9 was performed 1 week later. Additional animals of each age group were left ovary-intact but were spinal cord injured. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor test was performed. Spinal cords were collected on post-SCI days 1, 7, and 21, and processed for histological markers. Administration of 17 beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats improved recovery of hind-limb locomotion, increased white matter sparing, and decreased apoptosis in both the post- and pre-menopausal rats. Also, ovary-intact I-year-old rats did worse than ovary-intact 2-month-old rats, suggesting that endogenous estrogen confers neuroprotection in young rats, which is lost in older animals. Taken together, these data suggest that estrogen is neuroprotective in SCI and that the loss of endogenous estrogen-mediated neuroprotective seen in older rats can be attenuated with exogenous administration of 17 beta-estradiol."

However, molecular targets that mediate estrogen-induced expression of Bcl-2 are not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether, after SCI, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways are involved in estrogen-induced expression of Bcl-2. Both Akt and ERK were activated and peaked at 8 h after SCI. Treatment with estrogen significantly increased the level of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and ERK (pERK) after injury. Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor was also activated and peaked at 8 h after SCI. Treatment with estrogen significantly increased the level of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) after injury. Administration of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, decreased the level of pCREB after SCI, whereas PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, showed no significant effect. Also, treatment with LY294002 significantly inhibited expression of Bcl-2, but PD98059 showed no significant effect. Furthermore, treatment with estrogen inhibited apoptotic cell death, whereas treatment with LY294002 or PD98059 increased apoptotic cell death after SCI. Together, these data indicate that estrogen's neuroprotection is mediated in part by induction of Bcl-2 through PI3K/Akt-dependent CREB activation."

We examined the protective effect of estrogen on functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. 17beta-estradiol (3, 100, or 300 mug/kg) was administered intravenously 1-2 h prior to injury (pre-treatment), and animals were then subjected to a mild, weight-drop spinal cord contusion injury. Estradiol treatment significantly improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Fifteen to 30 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in estradiol-treated (100 mug/kg) rats when compared to vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion sizes increased progressively in either vehicle-treated or 17beta-estradiol-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with 17beta-estradiol, the lesion size was significantly reduced 18-28 days after SCI when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis revealed that apoptotic cell death peaked 24-48 h after injury. Also, SCI induced a marked increase in activated caspase-3 in the spinal cord, evident by 4 h after injury. However, administration of 17beta-estradiol significantly reduced the SCI-induced increase in apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activity after SCI. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol significantly increased expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, bcl-2 and bcl-x, after SCI while expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, bad and bax, was not affected by drug treatment. Finally, intravenous administration of 17beta-estradiol (100 mug/kg) immediately after injury (post-treatment) also significantly improved hind limb motor function 19-30 days after SCI compared to vehicle-treated controls. These data suggest that after SCI, 17beta-estradiol treatment improved functional recovery in the injured rat, in part, by reducing apoptotic cell death."

Recent studies have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) such as MMP2 play a critical role in inducing NP following SCI. Promoter methylation of MMPs is known to suppress their transcription and reduce NP. In this context, it has been shown in rodents that folic acid (FA), an FDA approved dietary supplement and key methyl donor in the central nervous system (CNS), increases axonal regeneration and repair of injured CNS in part via methylation. Purpose: Based on above observations, in this study, we test whether FA could decrease MMP2 expression and thereby decrease SCI-induced NP. Methods: Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250-270 g received contusion spinal cord injuries (cSCIs) with a custom spinal cord impactor device that drops a 10 g weight from a height of 12.5 mm. The injured rats received either i.p. injections of FA (80 mu g/kg) or water (control) 3 days prior and 17 days post-cSCI (mid phase) or for 3 days pre-cSCI and 14 days post-cSCI ending on the 42nd day of cSCI (late phase). The functional neurological deficits due to cSCI were then assessed by Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores either on post-impaction days 0 through 18 post-cSCI (mid phase) or on days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 (late phase). Baseline measurements were taken the day before starting treatments. Thermal hyperalgesia (TH) testing for pain was performed on 4 days pre-cSCI (baseline data) and on days 18, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post-cSCI. Following TH testing, animals were euthanized and spinal cords harvested for MMP-2 expression analysis. Result: The FA-treated groups showed higher BBB scores during mid phase (day 18) and in late phase (day 42) of injury compared to controls, suggesting enhanced functional recovery. There is a transient decline in TH in animals from the FA-treated group compared to controls when tested on days 18, 21, 28, and 35, indicative of a decrease in NP. However, when tested 25 days after stopping FA administration on day 42 of cSCI, no significant difference in TH was observed between FA-treated and control animals. Western blot analysis of the injured spinal cord from FA-treated animals showed significant decline in MMP2 expression compared to spinal cord samples from water-treated controls. Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that FA could alleviate NP and improve functional recovery post-SCI, possibly by reducing the expression of MMP2. Further studies will open up a novel and easy natural therapy, ideal for clinical translation with minimal side effects, for managing SCI-induced NP. Such studies might also throw light on a possible epigenetic mechanism in FA- induced recovery after SCI. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel."

We hypothesized that folic acid would reduce brain injury and improve neurological outcome in a neonatal piglet model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), using 4 experimental groups of 3- to 5-day-old female piglets. Two groups were intubated, anesthetized and had moderate brain injury induced by rapid axial head rotation without impact. One group of injured (Inj) animals received folic acid (Fol; 80 mu g/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 15 min following injury, and then daily for 6 days (Inj + Fol; n = 7). The second group of injured animals received an IP injection of saline (Sal) at the same time points (Inj + Sal; n = 8). Two uninjured (Uninj) control groups (Uninj + Fol, n = 8; Uninj + Sal, n = 7) were intubated, anesthetized and received folic acid (80 mu g/kg) or saline by IP injection at the same time points as the injured animals following a sham procedure. Animals underwent neurobehavioral and cognitive testing on days 1 and 4 following injury to assess behavior, memory, learning and problem solving. Serum folic acid and homocysteine levels were collected prior to injury and again before euthanasia. The piglets were euthanized 6 days following injury, and their brains were perfusion fixed for histological analysis. Folic acid levels were significantly higher in both Fol groups on day 6. Homocysteine levels were not affected by treatment. On day 1 following injury, the Inj + Fol group showed significantly more exploratory interest, and better motor function, learning and problem solving compared to the Inj + Sal group. Inj + Fol animals had a significantly lower cognitive composite dysfunction score compared to all other groups on day 1. These functional improvements were not seen on day 4 following injury. Axonal injury measured by beta-amyloid precursor protein staining 6 days after injury was not affected by treatment. These results suggest that folic acid may enhance early functional recovery in this piglet model of pediatric head injury. This is the first study to describe the application of complex functional testing to assess an intervention outcome in a swine model of TBI. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel"

To prevent NTDs, however, supplemental folate must be provided early in gestation. This suggests that the ability of folic acid to activate growth and differentiation mechanisms may be confined to the early embryonic period. Here, we show that folic acid can enhance growth and repair mechanisms even in the adult CNS. Using lesion models of CNS injury, we found that intraperitoneal treatment of adult rats with folic acid significantly improves the regrowth of sensory spinal axons into a grafted segment of peripheral nerve in vivo. Regrowth of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons into a similar graft also was enhanced, although to a smaller extent than spinal axons. Furthermore, folic acid supplementation enhances neurological recovery from a spinal cord contusion injury, showing its potential clinical impact. The results show that the effects of folic acid supplementation on CNS growth processes are not restricted to the embryonic period, but can also be effective for enhancing growth, repair, and recovery in the injured adult CNS."

When measured after induction of SCI, tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha), a stable PGI2 metabolite, thromboxane B-2 (TXB2), a stable metabolite of thromboxane A(2), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the injured spinal cord segment were significantly increased, peaking at 2, 3, and 4 h after induction of SCI, respectively. Subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (IM), a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, completely inhibited increases in tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) and TXB2, while administration of NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, did not affect these increases. Although pretreatment with IM enhanced increases in tissue levels of MPO, TNF, and TNF mRNA and exacerbated both motor disturbances and histological damage in the spinal cord of animals subjected to SCI, pretreatment with NS-398 had no effect on any of these findings. Both iloprost, a stable analog of PGI2, and leukocyte depletion significantly reversed changes in various variables and exacerbation of motor disturbances induced by IM pretreatment in animals subjected to SCI. These observations strongly suggested that compression trauma-induced increase in PGI2 production in spinal cord tissue might be mainly mediated by COX-1 and PGI2 might a play critical role in reduction of motor disturbances following SCI by inhibiting neutrophil accumulation through inhibition of TNF production."

The current gold-standard of acute care for spinal cord injury is to administer high doses of glucocorticoids within 8 h of injury; administration after 8 h may be without effect or detrimental to the outcome of the patient. Therefore, improved pharmacological approaches for limiting the extent of tissue damage and neurological dysfunction in the acute injury setting are urgently needed. Early intervention in CNS injury by antagonizing or controlling the post-injury inflammatory process with pharmaceutical agents is a major focus of current clinical and preclinical investigations. In this editorial overview, recent clinical trials and preclinical studies of brain and spinal cord injuries are discussed, including studies focusing on the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs (eg, minocycline); growth factors (eg, erythropoietin); dual anti-inflammatory and anti-vasospasm drugs, such as Rho and ROCK kinase inhibitors; and broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, such as PDE4 inhibitors. These new approaches hold great promise to improve outcomes for patients with brain and spinal injuries."

The SCI was performed by making a unilateral incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segments and the animals were allowed to survive 5 h after trauma. Different combination of neurotrophins, i.e., BDNF in combination with GDNF, NT-3, or NGF was applied topically over the traumatized spinal cord and motor dysfunction, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury were examined. Topical application of BDNF in combination with GDNF and NGF 30 min (but not 60 or 90 min) at high concentrations (0.5 mu g each) after SCI significantly improved motor function and reduced BSCB breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury at 5 h. However, concurrent application of BDNF, IGF-1, and GDNF (but not with NT-3 or NGF) even 60 or 90 min after trauma induced a significant reduction in motor dysfunction and spinal cord pathology. These observations suggest that a combination of neurotrophins may have added therapeutic value in the treatment of SCI, not reorted earlier."

Our goal was to replicate data from a paper published by Dr. Lloyd Guth and colleagues in which combined injections of lipopolysaccharide, indomethacin and pregnenolone (referred to herein as LIP therapy) conferred marked neuroprotection in a pre-clinical model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Specifically, post-injury injection of the combination LIP therapy was found to significantly reduce tissue damage at/nearby the site of injury and significantly improve recovery of locomotor function. In this report, we confirm the primary observations made by Guth et al., however, the effects of LIP treatment were modest. Specifically, LIP treatment improved myelin and axon sparing, axonal sprouting while reducing lesion cavitation. However, spontaneous recovery of locomotion, as assessed using historical (Tarlov scoring) and more current rating scales (i.e., BBB scoring), was not affected by LIP treatment. Instead, more refined parameters of functional recovery (paw placement accuracy during grid walk) revealed a significant effect of treatment. Possible explanations for the neuroprotective effects of LIP therapy are described along with reasons why the magnitude of neuroprotection may have differed between this study and that of Guth and colleagues.

RhoA has also been implicated in delayed secondary injury pathophysiology, such as free radical formation and loss of endothelial integrity leading to edema formation. In the present report, we have analyzed the effect of the central nervous system (CNS) permissive, putatively neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-1/-2 (COX-1/-2) inhibitor indomethacin in CNS effective dosage (2 mg/kg/day) on lesional RhoA expression following subacute spinal cord injury. In control rats receiving vehicle alone, RhoA(+) cells accumulate at the lesion site (Th8). At day 3 following SCI, the RhoA(+) cellular composition is composed prevailingly of microglia/macrophages and polymononuclear granulocytes, but few reactive astrocytes. In contrast, in the Verum group, lesional numbers of RhoA cells were reduced by indomethacin treatment by more than 60% (P < 0.0001). Inflammation-dependent RhoA expression accessible by cyclooxygenase inhibition proposes an immune-related mechanism. Our results identify COX blockers as candidates for a safe, synergistic, adjuvant treatment option in combination with cell-specific approaches to Rho inactivation, effectively minimizing the pool of RhoA(+) cells at the lesion site following SCI.

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report. we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.

This study investigated the potential role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and microglia in the migration of human Muller glia with neural stem cell characteristics following subretinal injection into the Lister hooded (LH) and Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat retinae. Neonate LH rat retina showed minimal baseline microglial accumulation (CD68-positive cells) that increased significantly 2 weeks after transplantation (p <.001), particularly in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer. In contrast, nontransplanted 5-week-old RCS rat retina showed considerable baseline microglial accumulation in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor outer segment debris zone (DZ) that further increased (p <.05) throughout the retina 2 weeks after transplantation. Marked deposition of the N-terminal fragment of CSPGs, as well as neurocan and versican, was observed in the DZ of 5-week-old RCS rat retinae, which contrasted with the limited expression of these proteins in the GCL of the adult and neonate LH rat retinae. Staining for CSPGs and CD68 revealed colocalization of these two molecules in cells infiltrating the ONL and DZ of the degenerating RCS rat retina. Enhanced immune suppression with oral prednisolone and intraperitoneal injections of indomethacin caused a reduction in the number of microglia but did not facilitate Muller stem cell migration. However, injection of cells with chondroitinase ABC combined with enhanced immune suppression caused a dramatic increase in the migration of Muller stem cells into all the retinal cell layers. These observations suggest that both microglia and CSPGs constitute a barrier for stem cell migration following transplantation into experimental models of retinal degeneration and that control of matrix deposition and the innate microglial response to neural retina degeneration may need to be addressed when translating cell-based therapies to treat human retinal disease."

Since, when appropriately activated, both astrocytes and macrophages secrete growth-promoting cytokines, we examined whether treatment with drugs that stimulate the secretory activities of these cells might promote tissue repair and reduce necrosis in the traumatized spinal cord. The spinal cord of rats was crushed extradurally at TS and the rats were injected intraperitoneally with (i) a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or ImuVert to activate cytokine secretion, (ii) Indomethacin to reduce necrosis by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, (iii) a combination of LPS+Indomethacin, or (iv) vehicle. After 28 days the lesion site was examined quantitatively by light microscopical image analysis. The lesion of vehicle-treated control animals showed large cavities, extensive infiltration by debris-engorged macrophages, and relatively few axons. Treatment with LPS or ImuVert significantly reduced the degree of cavitation and increased the number of cells and axons in the lesion. Treatment with LPS+Indomethacin was significantly more effective than treatment with LPS alone, while treatment with Indomethacin alone was ineffective. To test whether the histopathological differences between treated and control rats might be reflected in functional improvement, rats were subjected to a contusion (weight-drop) injury and their walking ability was quantified by the Tarlov scale for 28 days postoperatively. Treatment with LPS+Indomethacin significantly improved locomotor function of animals subjected to a moderate (1.25 g x 20 cm) injury. We conclude that tissue repair and functional recovery after spinal cord injury are enhanced by combined treatment with agents that promote the secretory activities of the nonneuronal cells and that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. These results indicate that the search for more effective treatments should include studies on combinations of drugs having different pharmacological specificities. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc."

A highly significant reduction of damage was achieved by immediate postinjury treatment with a combination of the following: an antiinflammatory substance, indomethacin; a stimulator of cytokine secretion, bacterial lipopolysaccharide; and the parent steroid, from which all other steroids arise, pregnenolone. This treatment reduced histopathological changes, spared tissue from secondary injury, and increased restoration of motor function. Remarkably, 11 of 16 of the animals treated with the above combination were able to stand and walk at 21 days after injury, 4 of them almost normally. The results were far superior to those obtained in controls or in animals to which the substances were given separately or in combinations of two.

The objectives of this study are to determine the nature of COX-2 expression in normal and traumatized rat spinal cord, and to determine the effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on functional recovery following spinal cord injury. Using a weight-drop model of spinal cord injury, COX-2 mRNA expression was studied with in situ hybridization, COX-2 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western analysis. Finally, using the highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, 1-[(4-methylsufonyl)phenyl]-3-tri-fluro-methyl-5-[(4-fluro)phenyl]prazole (SC58125), the effect of COX-2 inhibition on functional outcome following a spinal cord injury was determined. COX-2 was expressed in the normal adult rat spinal cord. COX-2 mRNA and protein production were increased following injury with increases in COX-2 mRNA production detectable at 2 h following injury. Increased levels of COX-2 protein were detectable for at least 48 h following traumatic spinal cord injury. Selective inhibition of COX-2 activity with SC58125 resulted in improved mean Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores in animals with 12.5- and 25-g/cm spinal cord injuries; however, the effect was significant only for the 12.5-g/cm injury group (p = 0.0001 vs. p = 0.0643 in the 25-g/cm group). These data demonstrate that COX-2 mRNA and protein expression are induced by spinal cord injury, and that selective inhibition of COX-2 improves functional outcome following experimental spinal cord injury."

The growth inhibitions from CNS myelin and astroglial chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans partially account for the lack of CNS repair. Here, we show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin, the drugs widely used as pain relievers in the clinic, can surmount axon growth restrictions from myelin and proteoglycans by potently inhibiting their downstream pathway RhoA signal. Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [( R)-(+)trans- N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)- cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma. In contrast, the non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have the axon growth-promoting effects on cultured or lesioned neurons. These studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs in treating CNS injuries characterized by axonal disconnection including spinal cord injury."

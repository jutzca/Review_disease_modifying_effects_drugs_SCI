A multidisciplinary approach to management is essential to ensure recovery during the acute phase, and comprehensive rehabilitative strategies are necessary to foster independence and quality of life throughout the chronic phase of injury. Complications that beset these individuals are often a unique consequence of SCI, and knowledge of the effects of SCI upon organ systems is essential for appropriate management. According to the National SCI Statistical Center (NSCISC), as of 2010 there were an estimated 265,000 persons living with SCI in the United States, with approximately 12,000 incidence cases annually. Although life expectancy for newly injured individuals with SCI is markedly reduced, persons with chronic SCI are expected to live about as long as individuals without SCI; however, longevity varies inversely with level of injury. Since 2005, 56 % of persons with SCI are tetraplegic, and due to paralysis of respiratory muscles, these individuals may be especially prone to pulmonary complications, which remain a major cause of mortality among persons with chronic SCI. We at the VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Center of Excellence for the Medical Consequences of SCI at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center have devoted more than 25 years to the study of secondary medical conditions that complicate SCI. Herein, we review pulmonary research at the Center, both our past and future endeavors, which form an integral part of our multidisciplinary approach toward achieving a greater understanding of and improving care for veterans with SCI."

The goal was to help these patients discontinue mechanical ventilation. The protocol, based on findings from other studies in the literature, consisted of pretraining optimization, as well as progressive resistance and endurance training. Following the protocol, mean maximal inspiratory pressure for low tetraplegic patients improved 75 percent, mean maximal expiratory pressure improved 71 percent, mean vital capacity increased 59 percent, mean on-vent endurance time increased 91.6 percent, and mean off-vent breathing time increased 76.7 percent. Both high and low tetraplegic patients achieved gains in inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, vital capacity, on-vent endurance, and off-vent breathing times. High tetraplegic patients improved their ability to spontaneously ventilate for short periods in case of accidental disconnection from the ventilator, while low tetraplegic patients were able to discontinue mechanical ventilation, which was the desired clinical outcome for this preliminary study."

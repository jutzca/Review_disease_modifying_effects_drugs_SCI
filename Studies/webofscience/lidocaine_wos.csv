Prior research has shown that nociceptive input can increase cell death, expand the area of hemorrhage, and impair long-term recovery. The current study shows that these adverse effects can be blocked by the sodium channel blocker lidocaine applied rostral to a contusion injury. Rats received a lower thoracic (T12) contusion injury, and noxious electrical stimulation (shock) was applied to the tail 24 h later. Immediately before shock treatment, a pharmacological transection was performed by slowly infusing lidocaine at T2. Long-term locomotor recovery was assessed over the next 21 days. Noxious electrical stimulation impaired locomotor recovery, and this effect was blocked by rostral lidocaine. Next, the acute effect of lidocaine was assessed. Tissue was collected 3 h after noxious stimulation, and the extent of hemorrhage was evaluated by assessing hemoglobin content using Western blotting. Nociceptive stimulation increased the extent of hemorrhage. Lidocaine applied at T2 before, but not immediately after, stimulation blocked this effect. A similar pattern of results was observed when lidocaine was applied at the site of injury by means of a lumbar puncture. The results show that a pharmacological transection blocks nociception-induced hemorrhage and exacerbation of locomotor deficits."

Neurophysiological and neu-roprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction."

In a clinically relevant spinal cord contusion injury model, prior work has shown that noxious stimulation at an intensity that engages pain (C) fibers soon after injury augments secondary injury and impairs functional recovery. Noxious input increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta and 18), cellular signals associated with cell death (caspase 3 and 8), and physiological signs of hemorrhage. Here, it is shown that reducing neural excitability after spinal cord injury (SCI) with the local anesthetic lidocaine (micro-injected by means of a lumbar puncture) blocks these adverse cellular effects. In contrast, treatment with an analgesic dose of morphine had no effect. Contused rats that received nociceptive stimulation soon after injury exhibited poor locomotor recovery, less weight gain, and greater tissue loss at the site of injury. Prophylactic application of lidocaine blocked the adverse effect of nociceptive stimulation on behavioral recovery and reduced tissue loss from secondary injury. The results suggest that quieting neural excitability using lidocaine can reduce the adverse effect of pain input (from polytrauma or surgery) after SCI."

Recent findings are reviewed that show SCI places the caudal tissue in a vulnerable state that exaggerates the effects nociceptive stimuli and promotes the development of nociceptive sensitization. Stimulation that is both unpredictable and uncontrollable induces a form of maladaptive plasticity that enhances nociceptive sensitization and impairs spinally mediated learning. In contrast, relational learning induces a form of adaptive plasticity that counters these adverse effects. SCI sets the stage for nociceptive sensitization by disrupting serotonergic (5HT) fibers that quell overexcitation. The loss of 5HT can enhance neural excitability by reducing membrane-bound K+-Cl- cotransporter 2, a cotransporter that regulates the outward flow of Cl-. This increases the intracellular concentration of Cl-, which reduces the hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Uncontrollable noxious stimulation also undermines the recovery of locomotor function, and increases behavioral signs of chronic pain, after a contusion injury. Nociceptive stimulation has a greater effect if experienced soon after SCI. This adverse effect has been linked to a downregulation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an upregulation in the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor. Noxious input enhances tissue loss at the site of injury by increasing the extent of hemorrhage and apoptotic/pyroptotic cell death. Intrathecal lidocaine blocks nociception-induced hemorrhage, cellular indices of cell death, and its adverse effect on behavioral recovery. Clinical implications are discussed."

We now realize that chronic pain may have a major impact on the quality of life in patients with SCI. The purpose of this paper is to review the current knowledge of mechanisms and treatment of neuropathic pain following SCI and to highlight some of the obstacles for improved pain treatment. Several preclinical models mimic human spinal cord injury reasonably well, but the interpretation of pain assessment and its translation into human SCI pain is not always straightforward and may be biased by other consequences of a spinal injury such as spasms and anxiety. Both preclinical and human studies suggest that a SCI causes major structural and biochemical changes in widespread areas of the central nervous system. The causal relationship between these changes and at-and below-level SCI pain needs to be further addressed. Neuropathic SCI pain is difficult to treat but evidence supports a treatment algorithm similar to what is proposed for peripheral neuropathic pain. As for any chronic pain condition, a biopsychosocial framework is necessary to understand the various aspects of pain interference and associated comorbidities such as anxiety and depression and to improve treatment.

This Na+ leak likely occurs via incompletely inactivated voltage-gated Na+ channels. This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 mu M were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (less than or equal to 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 mu M), disopyramide (10-300 mu M) and bupivacaine (10-100 mu M) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 mu M. Procainamide (100-300 mu M) was ineffective. These results suggest that Na+ channel blockers, including commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, may be effective in protecting central white matter, which is a target for anoxic/ischemic injury in diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury."

Perfusion of the spinal cord in 0-Ca2+ Ringer solution resulted in significantly improved recovery of the compound action potential. Similarly, removal of Na+ from the perfusate resulted in significantly improved recovery of conduction in dorsal column axons. Exposure of the anoxic spinal cord to the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), the Na-Ca exchange blockers benzamil and bepridil, Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride and harmaline, and perfusion in Ringer solution with pH adjusted to 6.4, all resulted in improved recovery. The tertiary anesthetics procaine and lidocaine, as well as phenytoin and carbamazepine, also resulted in improved recovery of compound action potential amplitude after 60 min of anoxia. These results demonstrate that a significant component of irreversible loss of conduction, following anoxic injury of the dorsal columns, is Ca2+-dependent. Moreover, these results demonstrate that TTX-inhibitable Na+ channels participate in the pathophysiology of anoxic injury in spinal cord white matter, and indicate that reverse Na-Ca exchange provides a route for at least part of the damaging influx of Ca2+ into an intracellular compartment in anoxic spinal cord white matter. Our results also suggest that extracellular acidosis may have a protective effect on anoxic spinal cord white matter, and support the hypothesis that anoxic injury of spinal cord white matter may involve the Na+-H+ exchanger."

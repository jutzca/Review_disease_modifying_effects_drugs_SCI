Established literature has shown that oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of acute CNS injuries. Recently, there have been many studies on the topic of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Some studies have revealed an emerging connection between acute CNS injuries and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, induced by the abnormal metabolism of lipids, glutathione (GSH), and iron, can accelerate acute CNS injuries. However, pharmaceutical agents, such as iron chelators, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), and liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), can inhibit ferroptosis and may have neuroprotective effects after acute CNS injuries. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this connection has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this paper, we discuss the general mechanisms of ferroptosis and its role in stroke, TBI, and SCI. We also summarize ferroptosis-related drugs and highlight the potential therapeutic strategies in treating various acute CNS injuries. Additionally, this paper suggests a testable hypothesis that ferroptosis may be a novel direction for further research of acute CNS injuries by providing corresponding evidence."

Although disease-modifying strategies are an unmet need in these disorders, lately, (pre)clinical studies suggested favorable effects after an intervention with bone marrow-derived stromal cells (bm-SC). Recent interventions with intrathecal transplantation of these cells in preclinical rodent models improved the functional outcome and reduced the inflammation, but not anti-inflammatory drugs. The benefit of bm-SCs was demonstrated in rats with an acute (traumatic spinal cord injury, tSCI) and in mice with a chronic [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like FUS 1-358 or SOD1-G93-A mutation] neurodegenerative process. Bm-SCs, were found to modify underlying disease processes, to reduce final clinical SCI-related outcome, and to slow down ALS-like clinical progression. After double-blind interventions with bm-SC transplantations, Vehicle (placebo), and (non)steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Methylprednisolone, Riluzole, Celecoxib), clinical, histological and histochemical findings, serum/spinal cytokines, markers for spinal microglial activation inclusive, evidenced the cell-to-cell action of bm-SCs in both otherwise healthy and immune-deficient tSCI-rats, as well as wild-type and FUS/SOD1-transgenic ALS-like mice. The multi-pathway hypothesis of the cell-to-cell action of bmSCs, presumably using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers of messages in the form of RNAs, DNA, proteins, and lipids rather than influencing a single inflammatory pathway, could be justified by the reported differences of cytokines and other chemokines in the serum and spinal tissue. The mode of action of bm-SCs is hypothesized to be associated with its dedicated adjustment of the pro-apoptotic glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta level towards an anti-apoptotic level whereas their multi-pathway hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as the level of the marker of activated microglia, ionized calcium binding adapter (Iba)-1 level."

Characterized by the functional loss and death of neurons, NDs lead to symptoms (dementia and seizures) that affect the daily lives of patients. In spite of extensive research into NDs, the number of approved drugs for their treatment remains limited. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new approaches for the prevention and treatment of NDs. Glycans (carbohydrate chains) are ubiquitous, abundant, and structural complex natural biopolymers. Glycans often covalently attach to proteins and lipids to regulate cellular recognition, adhesion, and signaling. The importance of glycans in both the developing and mature nervous system is well characterized. Moreover, glycan dysregulation has been observed in NDs such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, glycans are promising but underexploited therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of glycans in NDs. We also discuss a number of natural products that functionally mimic glycans to protect neurons, which therefore represent promising new therapeutic approaches for patients with NDs."

In spinal cord injury (SCI), all of these cellular processes are altered, but the potential contributions of glycosylation changes to these alterations has not been thoroughly investigated. We studied the glycosylation of injured spinal cord tissue from rats that received a contusion SCI. The N- and O-linked glycosylation was assessed at 3 and 14 days post-injury (DPI), and compared with uninjured control and time-matched sham spinal tissue. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS) were performed to analyze carbohydrate structures. Results revealed diverse and abundant glycosylation in all groups, with some carbohydrate structures differentially produced in SCI animals compared with uninjured controls and shams. One such change occurred in the abundance of the Sda structure, Neu5Ac-alpha-(2,3)-[GalNAc-beta-(1,4)-]Gal-beta-(1,4)-GlcNAc, which was increased in SCI samples compared with shams and non-injured controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot were performed on SCI and sham samples using the CT1 antibody, which recognizes the terminal trisaccharide of Sda with high specificity. Both of these metrics confirmed elevated Sda structure in SCI tissue, where IHC further showed that Sda is expressed mainly by microglia. The results of these studies suggest that SCI causes a significant alteration in N- and O-linked glycosylation."

It is well accepted that the inflammatory response in the CNS after injury exacerbates tissue loss and functional impairments. Unfortunately, the use of potent anti-inflammatory drugs, such as methylprednisolone, fails to promote therapeutic recovery and also gives rise to several undesirable side effects related to immunosuppression. The injury-induced inflammatory response is complex, and understanding the mechanisms that regulate this inflammation is therefore crucial in the quest to develop effective treatments. Bioactive lipids have emerged as potent molecules in controlling the initiation, coordination, and resolution of inflammation and in promoting tissue repair and recovery of homeostasis. These bioactive lipids are produced by cells involved in the inflammatory response, and their defective synthesis leads to persistent chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and fibrosis. The present chapter discusses recent evidence for the role of some of these bioactive lipids, in particular, eicosanoid and pro-resolving lipid mediators, in the regulation of inflammation after neurotrauma and highlights the therapeutic potential of some of these lipids in enhancing neurological outcomes after CNS injuries."

A multifactorial beneficial influence of omega-3 fatty acids on the health of humans and other mammals has been observed for many years. Therefore,omega-3 fatty acids and their function in the prophylaxis and treatment of various pathologies have been subjected to numerous studies. Regarding the documented therapeutic influence of omega-3 fatty acids on the nervous and immune systems, the aim of this paper is to present the current state of knowledge and the critical assessment of the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prophylaxis and treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) in rodent models. The prophylactic properties (pre-SCI) include the stabilization of neuron cell membranes, the reduction of the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and KC/GRO/CINC), the improvement of local blood flow, reduced eicosanoid production, activation of protective intracellular transcription pathways (dependent on RXR, PPAR-alpha, Akt, and CREB), and increased concentration of lipids, glycogen, and oligosaccharides by neurons. On the other hand, the therapeutic properties (post-SCI) include the increased production of endogenous antioxidants such as carnosine and homocarnosine, the maintenance of elevated GSH concentrations at the site of injury, reduced concentrations of oxidative stress marker (MDA), autophagy improvement (via increasing the expression of LC3-II), and p38 MAPK expression reduction in the superficial dorsal horns (limiting the sensation of neuropathic pain). Paradoxically, despite the well-documented protective activity of omega-3 acids in rodents with SCI, the research does not offer an answer to the principal question of the optimal dose and treatment duration. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing the role of multicenter rodent studies with the implementation of standards which initially may even be based on arbitrary criteria. Additionally, basing on available research data, the authors of this paper make a careful attempt at referring some of the conclusions to the human population."

Confocal Raman Microspectral Imaging (in combination with multivariate analysis) was adopted to illustrate the underlying biochemical mechanisms of LLLT treatment on a SCI rat model. Methods: Using transversal tissue sections, the Raman spectra can identify areas neighboring the injury site, glial scar, cavity, and unharmed white matter, as well as their correlated cellular alterations, such as demyelination and up-regulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Multivariate data analysis methods are used to depict the underlying therapeutic effects by highlighting the detailed content and distribution variations of the biochemical constituents. Results: It is confirmed that photon-tissue interactions might lead to a decay of the inhibitory response to remyelination by suppressing CSPG expression, as also morphologically demonstrated by reduced glial scar and cavity areas. An inter-group comparison semi-quantitatively confirms changes in lipids, phosphatidic acid, CSPGs, and cholesterol during SCI and its LLLT treatment, paving the way for in vitro and in vivo understanding of the biochemical changes accompanying pathobiological SCI events. Conclusion: The achieved results in this work not only have once again proved the well-known cellular mechanisms of SCI, but further illustrate the underlying biochemical variability during LLLT treatment, which provide a sound basis for developing real-time Raman methodologies to monitor the efficacy of the SCI LLLT treatment.

Here, we used shiverer (shi) mice to assess axon regeneration following spinal cord injury in the presence of MAIs and CSPG but in the absence of compact myelin. Although in vitro shi neurons displayed a similar intrinsic neurite outgrowth to wild-type neurons, in vivo, shi fibers had increased regenerative capacity, suggesting that the wild-type spinal cord contains additional inhibitors besides MAIs and CSPG. Our data show that besides myelin protein, myelin lipids are highly inhibitory for neurite outgrowth and suggest that this inhibitory effect is released in the shi spinal cord given its decreased lipid content. Specifically, we identified cholesterol and sphingomyelin as novel myelin-associated inhibitors that operate through a Rho-dependent mechanism and have inhibitory activity in multiple neuron types. We further demonstrated the inhibitory action of myelin lipids in vivo, by showing that delivery of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, a drug that reduces the levels of lipids specifically in the injury site, leads to increased axon regeneration of wild-type (WT) dorsal column axons following spinal cord injury. In summary, our work shows that myelin lipids are important modulators of axon regeneration that should be considered together with protein MAIs as critical targets in strategies aiming at improving axonal growth following injury."

In this environment, Gall can promote regeneration of injured peripheral axons, in part by modifying the function of macrophages recruited to the site of injury. Unlike in injured peripheral nerves, macrophages do not promote axon regeneration in the injured central nervous system (CNS), perhaps because Gall levels are not regulated appropriately. Because the dynamics and cellular localization of endogenous Gall have not been rigorously characterized after CNS injury, we examined the spatio-temporal distribution of Gall in rat spinal cords subjected to a standardized contusion injury. Whereas Gall was not expressed in uninjured spinal cord, it was significantly upregulated after SCI, especially within the lesion core. Gall was expressed in similar to 40% of lesion-localized macrophages at 3-28 days post-injury (dpi), and in similar to 45% of astrocytes in the lesion border at 7-28 dpi. Most lesion-localized Gal1 + macrophages did not express the phagocytosis marker ELM, and Gall + cells contained less phagocytosed lipids.

However, currently, neurologic impairment after SCI is measured and classified by functional examination. The identification of prognostic biomarkers of SCI would help to designate SC injured patients and correlate to diagnosis and correct treatment. Some proteins have already been identified as good potential biomarkers of central nervous system injury, both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum. However, the problem for using them as biomarkers is the way they should be collected, as acquiring CSF through a lumbar puncture is significantly invasive. Remarkably, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as interesting biomarker candidates because of their stability in biological fluids and their tissue specificity. Several miRNAs have been identified to have their expressions altered in SCI in many animal models, making them promising candidates as biomarkers after SCI. Moreover, there are yet no effective therapies for SCI. It is already known that altered lysophospholipids (LPs) signaling are involved in the biology of disorders, such as inflammation. Reports have demonstrated that LPs when locally distributed can regulate SCI repair and key secondary injury processes such as apoptosis and inflammation, and so could become in the future new therapeutic approaches for treating SCI."

Synthetic PPAR gamma agonists (e.g. thiazolidinediones) are used to treat Type II diabetes and have the potential to limit the risk of developing brain injuries such as stroke by mitigating the influence of comorbidities. If brain injury develops, PPAR gamma serves as a master gatekeeper of cytoprotective stress responses, improving the chances of cellular survival and recovery of homeostatic equilibrium. In the acute injury phase, PPAR gamma directly restricts tissue damage by inhibiting the NFKI3 pathway to mitigate inflammation and stimulating the Nrf2/ARE axis to neutralize oxidative stress. During the chronic phase of acute brain injuries, PPAR gamma activation in injured cells culminates in the repair of gray and white matter, preservation of the blood brain barrier, reconstruction of the neurovascular unit, resolution of inflammation, and long-term functional recovery. Thus, PPAR gamma lies at the apex of cell fate decisions and exerts profound effects on the chronic progression of acute injury conditions. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of PPAR gamma in stroke and brain trauma and highlight the novel role of PPAR gamma in long-term tissue repair. We describe its structure and function and identify the genes that it targets. PPAR gamma regulation of inflammation, metabolism, cell fate (proliferation/differentiation/maturation/survival), and many other processes also has relevance to other neurological diseases.

Our previous study has shown that the P2X(7) receptor regulates phagocytosis of nonopsonized particles and bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that P2X(7) also mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic lymphocytes and neuronal cells by human monocyte-derived macrophages under serum-free conditions. ATP inhibited this process to a similar extent as observed with cytochalasin D. P2X(7)-transfected HEK-293 cells acquired the ability to phagocytose apoptotic lymphocytes. Injection of apoptotic thymocytes into the peritoneal cavity of wild-type mice resulted in their phagocytosis by macrophages, but injection of ATP prior to thymocytes markedly decreased this uptake. In contrast, ATP failed to inhibit phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes in vivo by P2X(7)-deficient peritoneal macrophages. The surface expression of P2X(7) on phagocytes increased significantly during phagocytosis of either beads or apoptotic cells. A peptide screen library containing 24 biotin-conjugated peptides mimicking the extracellular domain of P2X(7) was used to evaluate the binding profile to beads, bacteria, and apoptotic cells. One peptide showed binding to all particles and cell membrane lipids. Three other cysteine-containing peptides uniquely bound the surface of apoptotic cells but not viable cells, whereas substitution of alanine for cysteine abolished peptide binding. Several thiol-reactive compounds including N-acetyl-L-cysteine abolished phagocytosis of apoptotic SH-SY5Y cells by macrophages. These data suggest that the P2X(7) receptor in its unactivated state acts like a scavenger receptor, and its extracellular disulphide bonds play an important role in direct recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells.

MSC-derived secretome may bypass many side effects of MSC-based therapy, including unwanted differentiation of engrafted MSCs. In contrast to MSCs which had to be expanded in culture to reach optimal cell number for transplantation, MSC-sourced secretome is immediately available for treatment of acute conditions, including fulminant hepatitis, cerebral ischemia and myocardial infarction. Additionally, MSC-derived secretome could be massively produced from commercially available cell lines avoiding invasive cell collection procedure. In this review article we emphasized molecular and cellular mechanisms that were responsible for beneficial effects of MSC-derived secretomes in the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory diseases of hepatobiliary, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and nervous system. Results obtained in a large number of studies suggested that administration of MSC-derived secretomes represents a new, cell-free therapeutic approach for attenuation of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Therapeutic effects of MSC-sourced secretomes relied on their capacity to deliver genetic material, growth and immunomodulatory factors to the target cells enabling activation of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways that resulted in tissue repair and regeneration."

In the present study, we examined the role of autophagy, inhibited by 3-MA and enhanced by rapamycin, in a model of acute spinal cord injury in rats. We found that rapamycin could significantly increase the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin1 at the injury site. At the same time, the number of neurons and astrocytes with LC3 positive in the spinal cord was upregulated with time. In addition, administration of rapamycin produced an increase in the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scores of injured rats, indicating high recovery of locomotor function. Furthermore, expression of the proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was upregulated and downregulated, respectively. By contrast, the results for rats treated with 3-MA, which inhibits autophagy, were the opposite of those seen with the rapamycin-treated rats. These results show that induction of autophagy can produce neuroprotective effects in acute spinal cord injury in rats via inhibition of apoptosis."

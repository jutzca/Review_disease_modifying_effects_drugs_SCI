The cascade of events which is called secondary injury is composed of vascular impairment, oedema, ischemia, inflammation, exotoxicity, electrolyte imbalance, lipid peroxidation, free radicals, necrosis and apoptotic cell death."

Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) derived from hiPSCs (hiPSC-NSPCs) have shown benefits for regenerative therapy of the central nervous system. However, owing to their intrinsic proliferative potential, therapies using transplanted hiPSC-NSPCs carry an inherent risk of undesired growth in vivo. Therefore, it is important to find cytotoxic drugs that can specifically target overproliferative transplanted hiPSC-NSPCs without damaging the intrinsic in vivo stem-cell system. Here, we examined the chemosensitivity of hiPSC-NSPCs and human neural tissue-derived NSPCs (hN-NSPCs) to the general anticancer drugs cisplatin, etoposide, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate. A time-course analysis of neurospheres in a microsphere array identified cisplatin and etoposide as fast-acting drugs, and mercaptopurine and methotrexate as slow-acting drugs. Notably, the slow-acting drugs were eventually cytotoxic to hiPSC-NSPCs but not to hN-NSPCs, a phenomenon not evident in the conventional endpoint assay on day 2 of treatment. Our results indicate that slow-acting drugs can distinguish hiPSC-NSPCs from hN-NSPCs and may provide an effective backup safety measure in stem-cell transplant therapies."

Methotrexate (MTX) has been used as a long-term therapy regimen for rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not clear whether MTX remediates SCI by inhibiting ERS. In the present study, to establish an in vitro ERS cell model, PC12 cells were pre-incubated with triglycerides (TG). MTT assays revealed that treatment with 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mu M TG decreased PC12 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, MTX treatment significantly reversed the TG-induced decrease in cell viability and increased apoptosis according to the flow cytometry assay (P < 0.05). Notably, western blotting indicated that MTX significantly decreased levels of glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12 expression (P < 0.05), which were increased following treatment with TG. Furthermore, the in vivo role of MTX in a rat model of SCI was evaluated. The motor behavioral function of rats was improved following treatment with MTX according to Basso, Beattie andBresnahan scoring (P < 0.05). Terminal deoxynucle-otidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end staining indicated that there were no apoptotic cells present in sham rats. In the SCI model group, apoptotic cells were observed at day 7; however, the number of apoptotic cells was reduced following an additional 7 days of MTX administration. Furthermore, levels of ERS-associated proteins, including caspase-3, activating transcription factor 6, serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 a, eukarvotic initiation factor 2 alpha and GRP78, were significantly increased following SCI; however, administration of MTX for 7 days significantly reversed this effect (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). Therefore, MTX may improve SCI by suppressing ERS-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo"

Methotrexate has anti-inflammatory activity and immunosuppressive effects, and can reduce inflammation after spinal cord injury. To analyze gene expression changes and the molecular mechanism of methotrexate combined with methylprednisolone in the treatment of spinal cord injury, a rat model of spinal cord contusion was prepared using the PinPoint T precision cortical impactor technique. Rats were injected with methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg 30 minutes after injury, and then subcutaneously injected with 0.3 mg/kg methotrexate 1 day after injury, once a day, for 2 weeks. TreadScan gait analysis found that at 4 and 8 weeks after injury, methotrexate combined with methylprednisolone significantly improved hind limb swing time, stride time, minimum longitudinal deviation, instant speed, footprint area and regularity index. Solexa high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze differential gene expression. Compared with methylprednisolone alone, differential expression of 316 genes was detected in injured spinal cord treated with methotrexate and methylprednisolone. The 275 up-regulated genes were mainly related to nerve recovery, anti- oxidative, anti- inflammatory and anti- apoptotic functions, while 41 down-regulated genes were mainly related to proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic functions. These results indicate that methotrexate combined with methylprednisolone exhibited better effects on inhibiting the activity of inflammatory cytokines and enhancing antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects and thereby produced stronger neuroprotective effects than methotrexate alone. The 316 differentially expressed genes play an important role in the above processes."

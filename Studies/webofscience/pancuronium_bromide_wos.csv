Based on this premise, electrophysiologic recording techniques were employed in the present investigation to first determine qualitatively whether latent respiratory pathways are activated spontaneously following prolonged post hemisection periods (4-16 weeks) without any therapeutic intervention. Our second objective in a separate group of hemisected animals was to quantitate any documented functional recovery under the following standardized recording conditions: bilateral vagotomy, paralysis with pancuronium bromide, artificial ventilation, and constant PCO2 (maintained at 25 mmHg)."

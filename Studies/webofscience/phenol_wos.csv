Because spinal cord ischemia is inadequately treated, we studied the effects of [4-((1E)-2-(5-(4 hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl-)-1-phenyl-1H -pyrazoyl-3-yl) vinyl)-2-methoxy-phenol)] (CNB-001), a novel curcumin-based compound, in a rabbit SCI model. CNB-001 is known to inhibit human 5-lipoxy-genase and 15-lipoxygenase and reduce the ischemia-induced inflammatory response. Moreover, CNB-001 can reduce the level of oxidative stress markers and potentiate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor signaling. The Tarlov scale and quantal analysis technique results revealed that CNB-001 administered as an intravenous dose (bolus) 30 minutes prior to spinal cord ischemia improved the behaviors of female New Zealand White rabbits. The improvements were similar to those produced by the uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. At 48 hours after aortic occlusion, there was a 42.7% increase (P < 0.05) in tolerated ischemia duration (n = 14) for rabbits treated with CNB-001 (n = 16), and a 72.3% increase for rabbits treated with the positive control memantine (P < 0.05) (n = 23) compared to vehicle-treated ischemic rabbits (n = 22). CNB-001 is a potential important novel treatment for spinal cord ischemia induced by aortic occlusion. All experiments were approved by the CSMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC #4311) on November 1, 2012."

We evaluated the effect of preinjury large bowel emptying on this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 52) were fasted for 24 or 48 hr with water ad libitum and pretreated with lactose (0.8 g) or saline. Next, laminectomy followed or not by complete SCT between T4 and T5 vertebrae was performed. Phenol red recovery in the stomach and proximal, medial, and distal small intestine was determined 1 day later. In animals submitted to 24 hr fasting + saline, SCT increased gastric recovery by 42.8% and decreased medial small intestine recovery by 56.2%, while 48 hr fasting C saline or 24 hr fasting + lactose prevented the inhibition of gastric emptying (GE) in SCT animals. The 48 hr fasting + lactose prevented the inhibition of both GE and gastrointestinal transit. SCT-induced inhibition of upper gastrointestinal motility may involve enhancement of inhibitory reflexes, which can be prevented by large bowel emptying."

Phenol red recovery in the stomach, proximal, mid-and distal small intestine was determined 1, 7, 10, 15, and 30 days thereafter. Gastric recovery increased by 51.2 and 38.9% and mid-intestinal recovery decreased by 45.5 and 66.6% at one and seven days after SCT (P < 0.05). Proximal small intestine recovery increased by 45.9% 10 days after SCT but no inhibition of gastrointestinal motility was observed thereafter. Stool output significantly decreased in the first seven days after SCT (P < 0.05). In summary, gastrointestinal motility in awake rats is inhibited throughout the first 10 days after thoracic SCT but not thereafter."

In this study, female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=5/group x 4: T10-T11 contusion, laminectomy, or naive) were fasted for 24 In before being submitted to dye recovery assays (Phenol Red solution, 1.5 ml/rat; per oral) on GI emptying/transiting at 48 h or 4 weeks postinjury (p.i.). Compared with controls, SCI significantly increased dye recovery rate (DRR, determined by spectrophotometry) in the duodenum (+84.6%) and stomach (+32.6%), but decreased it in the jejunum (-64.1% and -49.5%) and ileum (-73.6% and -70.1%) at 48 In and 4 weeks p.i., respectively (P <= 0.005, ANOVA with post hoc t-test). Electrophysiological analysis revealed that purinergic fast inhibitory junction potential (IJP) was reduced similar to 30% in the antrum and duodenum of rats 48 h p.i. (numbers of animals/numbers of tissue samples=3/7; P<0.001), and slow IJP was essentially abolished. Immunocytochemistry consequently uncovered significant reductions in the GI vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (i.e. slow IJP mediators) reactivity at 48 h and 4 weeks p.i., suggesting that SCI disrupted interstitial neurotransmission. Importantly, SCI caused discernible atrophy of the GI mucosa and muscle coat (e.g. the two layers of gastric wall were correspondingly 28% and 27% thinner 4 weeks p.i.). We conclude that contusive SCI triggers GI abnormalities with unique pathophysiology and pathology in different segments. Such GI disorders evolve continuously during the entire post-SCI period examined, and may require therapeutic development to target specific underlying mechanisms.

This study evaluates the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 147) were fasted for 16 h and had the left jugular vein cannulated followed by laminectomy or laminectomy + complete SCT between T-4 and T-5 vertebrae. The next day, a test meal (1.5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0.5 mg/ml in 5% glucose) was administered by gavage feeding and 10 min later cervical dislocation was performed. Dye recovery in the stomach, and proximal, mid and distal small intestine was determined by spectrophotometry. SCT inhibited GE and GI transit since it increased gastric recovery by 71.3% and decreased mid small intestine recovery by 100% (P < 0.05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy + section of the splanchnic nerves, i.v. hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) prevented the development of the SCT effect on GE and GI transit. Pretreatment with i.v. naloxone (3, mg/kg), L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was ineffective. Bilateral adrenalectomy or guanethidine (10 mg/kg) increased the magnitude of the GE inhibition, while i.v. prazosin (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the magnitude but did not abolish the GE inhibition. In summary, the inhibition of GI motility observed 1 day after thoracic SCT in awake rats seems to involve vagal and possibly splanchnic pathways. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

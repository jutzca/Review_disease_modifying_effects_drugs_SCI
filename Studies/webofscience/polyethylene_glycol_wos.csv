However, the influx of Ca2+ continued through disrupted membranes when EFS completed. As polyethylene glycol (PEG) can reseal the damaged membranes, we proposed a hypothesis that combination therapy of EFS and PEG may effectively prevent Ca2+ influx and further promote functional recovery in rats subjected to SCI. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: saline group, treated with saline only; control group, treated with EFS and saline; and experimental group, treated with EFS and PEG. The effects of EFS combined with PEG were assessed by means of injury potential and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores. Data showed that the injury potential at the moment of EFS termination in experimental group was significantly smaller compared with that in control group, but higher than that in saline group. Moreover, the BBB scores in experimental group were significantly higher than those in other groups. These findings suggest that combination therapy of EFS and PEG could further enhance functional recovery in acute SCI of rats."

In the first, trauma events deliver direct pressure to the cervical spine, which may compress, dislocate, or fracture the spine, and in turn compress, crush, or transect the spinal cord. In the process, local neurons are destroyed and sensory and motor pathways can be severed. In the second phase, acute tissue responses, bleeding, and inflammation rapidly and radically change the physical and chemical conditions at the wound site. Finally, days, weeks, and months after the initial trauma, chronic post-injury processes reform the wound site into a lasting scar that impedes regeneration of spinal cord pathways. A major goal of current spinal cord injury research should be rapid and lasting inhibition of acute and chronic tissue reactions in the spinal cord wound that lead to a growth-inhibiting environment and diverting these reactions toward conditions that favor regeneration of severed spinal pathways. Here, we consider experimental strategies that could form the basis for treatments that can be rapidly administered after trauma and provides lasting benefit to spinal cord regeneration and rehabilitation."

Given the devastating physical, emotional and economic impact of severe SCI, the quest for better management in the acute setting including pharmacological and surgical interventions has been unrelenting over the past several decades and remains a highly contentious area of human medicine. This has led to an enormous amount of experimental and to a lesser degree clinical research information being produced. Recent investigations have defined the significance of both the primary and secondary pathophysiological mechanisms in SCI. With this understanding, modem neuroscience techniques have made advances towards more effective treatment interventions with the real prospect of improving long term functional outcomes in both humans and animals. This review will discuss the pathophysiology and neuroprotective aspects of the initial medical management in patients with acute SCI, with a focus on clinically evaluated therapeutic interventions and the relevant controversies that surround the issue."

The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the literature related to treatment of acute canine thoracolumbar IVDE to help construct a framework for standard care of acute canine thoracolumbar IVDE where sufficient evidence exists and to highlight opportunities for future prospective veterinary clinical research useful to strengthen care recommendations in areas where evidence is low or non-existent. While there exist a number of gaps in the veterinary literature with respect to standards of care for dogs with acute thoracolumbar IVDE, recommendations for standard care can be made in some areas, particularly with respect to surgical decompression where the currently available evidence supports that surgery should be recommended for dogs with nonambulatory paraparesis or worse. While additional information is needed about the influence on timing of decompression on outcome in dogs that are deep pain negative for longer than 48 h duration, there is no evidence to support treatment of the 48 h time point as a cut off beyond which it becomes impossible for dogs to achieve locomotor recovery. Surgical decompression is best accomplished by either hemilaminectomy or mini-hemilaminectomy and fenestration of, at a minimum, the acutely ruptured disc. Adjacent discs easily accessed by way of the same approach should be considered for fenestration given the evidence that this substantially reduces future herniation at fenestrated sites. Currently available neuroprotective strategies such as high does MPSS and PEG are not recommended due to lack of demonstrated treatment effect in randomized controlled trials, although the role of anti-inflammatory steroids as a protective strategy against progressive myelomalacia and the question of whether anti-inflammatory steroids or NSAIDs provide superior medical therapy require further evaluation."

In this study, we utilize macroporous polyethylene glycol (PEG) tubes, which were previously found to modulate the post-SCI microenvironment, to serve as a viable, soft substrate for injecting mouse embryonic day 14 (E14) spinal progenitors 2 weeks after tube implantation into a mouse SCI model. At 2 weeks after transplantation (4 weeks after injury), 4.3% of transplanted E14 spinal progenitors survived when transplanted directly into tubes compared to 0.7% when transplanted into the injury alone. Surviving E14 spinal progenitors exhibited a commitment to the neuronal lineage at 4 weeks post-injury, as assessed by both early and late phenotypic markers. Mice receiving tubes with E14 spinal progenitor transplantations had on average 21 +/- 4 axons/mm(2) regenerated compared to 8 +/- 1 axons/mm(2) for the injury only control, which corresponded with a significant increase in remyelination compared to the injury only control, while all conditions exhibited improved forelimb control 4 weeks after injury compared to the injury only.

We hypothesized that PEG can also restore axonal continuity in the central nervous system. In this current experiment, coronal sectioning of the brains of Sprague-Dawley rats was performed after animal sacrifice. 3Brain high-resolution microelectrode arrays (MEA) were used to measure mean firing rate (MFR) and peak amplitude across the corpus callosum of the ex-vivo brain slices. The corpus callosum was subsequently transected and repeated measurements were performed. The cut ends of the corpus callosum were still apposite at this time. A PEG solution was applied to the injury site and repeated measurements were performed. MEA measurements showed that PEG was capable of restoring electrophysiology signaling after transection of central nerves. Before injury, the average MFRs at the ipsilateral, midline, and contralateral corpus callosum were 0.76, 0.66, and 0.65 spikes/second, respectively, and the average peak amplitudes were 69.79, 58.68, and 49.60 mu V, respectively. After injury, the average MFRs were 0.71, 0.14, and 0.25 spikes/second, respectively and peak amplitudes were 52.11, 8.98, and 16.09 mu V, respectively.

Here we review the expression of neurotrophic factors and their receptors in the spinal cord and their regulations in response to different forms of injury. While the spinal cord is less prone than the brain to upregulate these proteins, GDNF and NGF are upregulated in the meninges following weight-drop injury. GFR-alpha1, BDNF, p75 and truncated trkB are also upregulated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is shown to offer neuroprotection if delivered immediately after impact injury. Olfactory ensheathing glial cells express a limited number of neurotrophic molecules, but are able to improve the final outcome of a weight-drop injury following transplantation to the spinal cord. Transplantation of cells containing neurotrophic factors, such as those found in developing dental pulp, offers additional neuroprotective alternatives. Cyst formation is an important clinical problem which can be modeled in rats to further our understanding of factors that cause their development. To monitor sensory deficits and sensory recovery, we have developed fMRI techniques and find that full recovery of hindlimb walking as determined by the BBB scale can occur in the absence of sensory-evoked fMRI signals in the brain. Preliminary data suggest that the implantation of biodegradable tubes containing olfactory ensheathing cells may be beneficial in partial spinal cord injury. Finally, bone marrow stromal cells, proliferated in vitro, survive grafting to the spinal cord and differentiate."

Three distinct thiolated chitosan precursors were made by varying reaction conditions; a modification of chitosan with Traut's reagent (2-iminothiolane) displayed the most attractive hydrogel properties once mixed with polyethylene glycol.

The saline and hydrogel-injected animals both showed a similar response from ED1+ microglia and GFAP overexpression. No significant differences were found between saline-injected and hydrogel-injected groups for any of the measures studied, but there was a trend toward decreased affected area size from 1 to 2 weeks in both groups.

Currently no sufficient regenerative therapeutic strategy exists for this disease. Following spinal cord injury spinal cord parenchyma including glial and neuronal cells is irreversibly lost. In particular after complete spinal cord injury, which disrupts all descending motor and ascending sensory projections, functional recovery is only achievable by bridging the lesion defect to allow regrowth across the site of injury and reinnervation of previous target neurons. Substantial progress in this respect has been achieved through cell transplantation strategies. Specific primary cell populations replace lost spinal cord parenchyma and provide a growth permissive interface for regenerating axons. However, in all of these strategies axon regeneration does not occur in a directed fashion, preventing reconnecting of disrupted axon pathways. Therefore, the injured spinal cord requires a regrowth directing structured scaffold."

Isolated spinal cords were subjected to compression injury and treated with PEG or DSPE-PEG immediately after injury. The compound action potential (CAP) was recorded before and after injury to assess the functional recovery. Furthermore, injury potential, the difference in gap potentials before and after compression, and the concentration of intracellular ions were used to evaluate the effect of DSPE-PEG on reducing ion influx. Data showed that the injury potential and ion concentration of the untreated, PEG and DSPE-PEG group, without significant difference among them, are remarkably higher than those of the intact group. Moreover, the CAP recovery of the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated spinal cords was significantly greater than that of the untreated spinal cords. The level of CAP recovery in the DSPE-PEG and PEG treated groups was the same, but the concentration of DSPE-PEG used was much lower than the concentration of PEG. These results suggest that instant application of DSPE-PEG could effectively repair functional disturbance in SCI at a much lower concentration than PEG. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The SAPP micelles were efficiently accumulated in the lesion site of SCI rats via the specific binding between sialic acid and E-selectin.

In polyethylene glycol-treated group (CHIT/PEG), the conduit was filled with polyethylene glycol solution. The regenerated fibers were studied within 12 weeks after surgery. Results: The behavioral and functional tests confirmed faster recovery of the regenerated axons in PEG-treated group compared to Chitosan group (p<.05). The mean ratios of gastrocnemius muscles weight were measured. There was statistically significant difference between the muscle weight ratios of CHIT/PEG and Chitosan groups (p<.05). Morphometric indices of regenerated fibers showed number and diameter of the myelinated fibers were significantly higher in CHIT/PEG than in Chitosan. In immuohistochemistry, the location of reactions to S-100 in CHIT/PEG was clearly more positive than Chitosan group. Conclusion: polyethylene glycol solution when loaded in a chitosan-based hybrid nanofiber conduit resulted in acceleration of functional recovery and quantitative morphometric indices of sciatic nerve."

Glial scar formation in chronic injury is a likely contributor to limitation on regeneration. We have removed existing scar tissue in chronically contused rat spinal cord using a rose Bengal-based photo ablation approach. In this study, we compared two chemically modified rose bengal derivatives to unmodified rose bengal, both confirming and expanding on our previously published report. Rats were treated with unmodified rose bengal (RB1) or rose bengal modified with hydrocarbon (RB2) or polyethylene glycol (RB3), to determine the effects on scar components and spared tissue post-treatment. Our results showed that RB1 was more efficacious than RB2, while still maintaining minimal collateral effects on spared tissue. RB3 was not taken up by the cells, likely because of its size, and therefore had no effect. Treatment with RB1 also resulted in an increase in serotonin eight days post-treatment in chronically injured spinal cords. Thus, we suggest that unmodified rose Bengal is a potent candidate agent for the development of a therapeutic strategy for scar ablation in chronic SCI."

A neuron's response to axon injury results from a complex interplay of neuron-intrinsicand environmental factors. The contribution of axotomy to the death of neurons in spinal cord injury is controversial because very remote axotomy is unlikely to result in neuronal death, whereas death of neurons near an injury may reflect environmental factors such as ischemia and inflammation. In lampreys, axotomy due to spinal cord injury results in delayed apoptosis of spinal-projecting neurons in the brain, beyond the extent of these environmental factors. This retrograde apoptosis correlates with delayed resealing of the axon, and can be reversed by inducing rapid membrane resealing with polyethylene glycol. Studies in mammals also suggest that polyethylene glycol may be neuroprotective, although the mechanism(s) remain unclear. This review examines the early, mechanical, responses to axon injury in both mammals and lampreys, and the potential of polyethylene glycol to reduce injury-induced pathology. Identifying the mechanisms underlying a neuron's response to axotomy will potentially reveal new therapeutic targets to enhance regeneration and functional recovery in humans with spinal cord injury."

The importance of intrinsic factors is illustrated in the sea lamprey by the 18 pairs of large, individually identified reticulospinal (RS) neurons, whose axons are located in the same spinal cord tracts but vary greatly in their ability to regenerate after spinal cord transection (TX). The neurons that are bad regenerators also undergo very delayed apoptosis, signaled early by activation of caspases. We noticed that the neurons with a low probability of axon regeneration tend to be larger than the good regenerators. We postulate that the poorly regenerating larger neurons have larger caliber axons, which reseal more slowly, allowing more prolonged entry of toxic signals (e.g., Ca++) into the axon at the injury site. To test this hypothesis, we used a dye-exclusion assay, applying membrane-impermeable dyes to the cut ends of spinal cords at progressively longer post-TX intervals. Axons belonging to the very small neurons (not individually identified) of the medial inferior RS nucleus resealed within 15 min post-TX. Almost 75% of axons belonging to the medium-sized identified RS neurons resealed within 3 h. At this time, only 36% of the largest axons had resealed, often taking more than 24 h to exclude the dye. There was an inverse relationship between an RS neuron's size and the probability that its axon would regenerate (r = -0.92) and that the neuron would undergo delayed apoptosis, as indicated by staining with a fluorescently labeled inhibitor of caspases (FLICA; r = 0.73). The artificial acceleration of resealing with polyethylene glycol (PEG) reduced retrograde neuronal apoptosis by 69.5% at 2 weeks after spinal cord injury (SCI), suggesting that axon resealing is a critical determinant of cell survival. Ca++-free Ringer's solution with EGTA prolonged the sealing time and increased apoptotic signaling, suggesting that factors other than Ca++ diffusion into the injured tip contribute to retrograde death signaling. A longer distance of the lesion from the cell body reduced apoptotic signaling independent of the axon sealing time."

The biological activity and dose-release characteristics of rapamycin from microspheres alone and from microspheres embedded in the scaffold were determined in vitro.

Furthermore, membrane fluidity and its sealing process vary at different temperatures. Here, we have assessed the possible synergistic effects of PEG and temperature on the repair of neural membranes in an SCI model. The effects of PEGs (400, 1,000 and 2,000 Da) were studied at different temperatures (25, 37 and 40 A degrees C) by means of compound action potential (CAP) recovery and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Isolated spinal cords were mounted in a double sucrose gap chamber, where the amplitude and area of CAPs were recorded after implementing injury, in the presence and absence of PEG. Moreover, the LDH assay was used to assess the effects of PEG on membrane resealing. Data showed that the least CAP recovery occurred at 25 A degrees C, followed by 37 and 40 A degrees C, in all treated groups. Moreover, maximum CAP amplitude recovery, 65.46 +/- A 5.04 %, was monitored in the presence of PEG400 at 40 A degrees C, followed by 41.49 +/- A 2.41 % in PEG1000 and 37.36 +/- A 1.62 % in PEG2000. Furthermore, raising the temperature from 37 to 40 A degrees C significantly increased CAP recovery in the PEG2000 group. Similar recovery patterns were obtained by CAP area measurements and LDH assay. The results suggest that application of low-molecular weight PEG (PEG400) in mild hyperthermia conditions (40 A degrees C) provides the optimum condition for membrane sealing in SCI model."

The in vitro experimental results indicated that cultured astrocytes could be killed by using upconversion nanoparticles after excitation with near infrared light. By transplanting UCNPs-PEG-M540 into the margin area of injured epicenter of spinal cord, the recovery of rat's hindlimb function was evaluated in Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, respectively. The improvement in microenvironment of the injured spinal cord was also evaluated by glial fibrillary acidic protein staining, neurofiliment staining, biotinylated dextran amine anterograde tracing and western blotting. Our results demonstrated that more regenerative axons of corticospinal tract were found to surround and pass through the injured cavity to the caudal cord with transplanting UCNPs-PEG-M540 into the injured spinal cord. In conclusion, our results strongly suggested that upconversion nanoparticles combined with photodynamic therapy can promote functional recovery in rats' hindlimbs by reducing the formation of glial scar and promoting remyelination of injured axons."

Hemorrhage within the spinal cord also was maximal at 20 min, consistent with its vasoconstrictive actions in the central nervous system (CNS). Microvascular blood flow recovered to up to 50% of normal volume in the injury penumbra by 6 h, but not at the epicenter. A comparison with an endothelial cell marker suggested that many microvessels fail to be reperfused up to 48 h post-injury. The ischemia was probably caused by vasospasm of vessels penetrating the parenchyma, because repeated Doppler measurements over the spinal cord showed a doubling of total blood flow over the first 12 h. Moreover, intravenous infusion of magnesium chloride, used clinically to treat CNS vasospasm, greatly improved the number of perfused microvessels at 24 and 48 h. The magnesium treatment seemed safe as it did not increase hemorrhage, despite the improved parenchymal blood flow. However, the treatment did not reduce acute microvessel, motor neuron or oligodendrocyte loss, and when infused for 7 days did not affect functional recovery or spared epicenter white matter over a 4 week period. These data suggest that microvascular blood flow can be restored with a clinically relevant treatment following spinal cord injury."

Different reasons could explain these disappointing results: on one side the multifactorial evolution of SCI after the primary injury that limits the beneficial effect of just one targeted treatment and, on the other, the restricted access of pharmacological therapies to the spinal cord. For these reasons, recently, a growing interest has been shown in the development of alternative delivery strategies to administer drugs and/or biological/cellular therapies into the spine (hydrogel and nanoparticles).

Apamin, one of the major components of honey bee venom, serves as the targeting moiety, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) serves as the drug-loaded material, and curcumin is used as the therapeutic agent. Apamin was conjugated with NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide)-PEG-DSPE in a site-specific manner, and APM were prepared by a thin-film hydration method. A formulation comprising 0.5 mol % targeting ligand with 50 nm particle size showed strong targeting efficiency in vivo and was evaluated in pharmacodynamic assays. A 7-day treatment by daily intravenous administration of low doses of APM (corresponding to 5 mg/kg of curcumin) was performed. Significantly enhanced recovery and prolonged survival was found in the SCI mouse model, as compared to sham-treated groups, with no apparent toxicity.

Thus, PEG repairs mechanically injured cells by at least two distinct pathways: resealing of the disrupted plasma membrane and direct protection of mitochondria. Besides repairing primary membrane damage, PEG treatment also results in significant attenuation of oxidative stress, likely due to its capacity to reseal the membrane, thereby breaking the cycle of cellular damage and free-radical production. Based on this, in addition to the practicality of its application, we expect that PEG may be established as an effective treatment for SCI where membrane disruption and mitochondrial damage are implicated."

We have previously shown that the application of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) following spinal cord or brain injury can rapidly restore membrane integrity, reduce oxidative stress, restore impaired axonal conductivity, and mediate functional recovery in rats, guinea pigs, and dogs. However there are limits to both the concentration and the molecular weight of the application that do not permit the broadest recovery across an injured animal population. In this study, PEG-decorated silica nanoparticles (PSiNPs) sealed cells, as shown by the significantly reduced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from damaged cells compared with uncoated particles or PEG alone. Further in vivo tests showed that PSiNPs also significantly reduced the formation of reactive oxygen species and the process of lipid peroxidation of the membrane. Fabrication of PSiNPs containing embedded dyes also revealed targeting of the particles to damaged, but not undamaged, spinal cord tissues. In an in vivo crush/contusion model of guinea pig SCI, every animal but one injected with PSiNPs recovered conduction through the cord lesion, whereas none of the control animals did.

We also compared the capacity of P 188 to that of PEG to suppress aggregation of carboxypeptidase A denatured in the presence of trifluoroethanol and to facilitate recovery of catalytic activity. In contrast to the multi-block copolymers, PEG had no effect in inhibiting aggregation of HEWL or of carboxypeptidase A with the recovery of catalytic activity. At very high polymer:protein ratios (>= 10: 1), PEG increased aggregation of heat-denatured HEWL and BSA, consistent with its known properties to promote macromolecular crowding and crystallization of proteins. At a polymer:protein ratio of 2: 1, the tetra-block copolymer T1107 was the most effective of the three surfactant copolymers, completely suppressing aggregation of heat-denatured HEWL. At a T1107:BSA ratio of 10: 1, the poloxamer suppressed aggregation of heat-denatured BSA by 50% compared to that observed in the absence of the polymer. We showed that the extent of suppression of aggregation of heat-denatured proteins by multi-block surfactant copolymers is dependent on the size of the protein and the copolymer: protein molar ratio. We also concluded that at least one of the tertiary nitrogens in the ethylene-1,2-diamine structural core of the T1107 copolymer is protonated, and that this electrostatic factor underlies its capacity to suppress aggregation of denatured proteins more effectively than nonionic, multi-block poloxamers. These results indicate that amphiphilic, surfactant, multi-block copolymers are efficient as additives to suppress aggregation and to facilitate refolding of denatured proteins in solution. Because of these properties, multi-block, surfactant copolymers are suitable for application to a variety of biotechnological and biomedical problems in which refolding of denatured or misfolded proteins and suppression of aggregation are important objectives.

Furthermore, in PEG-treated animals, the lesion was more focal and less diffuse throughout the damaged segment of the spinal cord, so that control cords showed a significantly extended lesion surface area.

In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007).

The emergence of biomaterials for regeneration and increased collaboration between engineers, basic and translational scientists, and clinicians hold promise for the development of effective therapies for SCI.

These observations stood out against a control group in blinded evaluation. Conduction through the lesion was monitored by stimulating the tibial nerve of the hind limb, and measuring the arrival of evoked potentials at the contralateral sensory cortex of the brain (somatosensory evoked potentials; SSEP). Behavioral recovery was determined by a return of sensitivity of formerly areflexic receptive fields of the cutaneous trunchi muscle (CTM) reflex. This contraction of back skin in response to tactile stimulation is totally dependent on the integrity of an identified bilateral column of ascending long tract axons. A statistically significant recovery of both SSEP conduction through the lesion and the CTM reflex occurred in P188-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. Quantitative 3D computer reconstruction of the lesioned vertebral segment of spinal cord revealed a statistically significant sparing of spinal cord parenchyma and a significant reduction in cavitation of the spinal cord compared to control animals We determined that the proportion of P188-treated animals that recovered evoked potentials were nearly identical to that produced by a subcutaneous injection of polyethylene glycol (PEG). In contrast, P188 was not as effective as PEG in producing a recovery of CTM functioning.

According to axon regeneration-supporting effects, the biopolymers could be ranked in the order PEG > > alginate-hydrogel > Matrigel (TM). Even after complete chronic transection, the PEG-bridge allowed long-distance axon regeneration through the grafted area and for, at least, 1 cm beyond the lesion/graft border. As revealed by electron microscopy, bundles of regenerating axons within the matrix area received myelin ensheathment from Schwann cells. The beneficial effects of PEG-implantation into the resection-cavity were accompanied by long-lasting significant locomotor improvement over a period of 8 months. Following complete spinal re-transection at the rostral border of the PEG-graft the locomotor recovery was aborted, suggesting a functional role of regenerated axons in the initial locomotor improvement.

Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Scale. Results indicated that iNSCs showed similar morphological features with wild-type neural stem cells (wt-NSCs), and expressed a variety of neural stem cell marker genes. Furthermore, iNSCs were shown to survive, with the ability to self-renew and undergo neural differentiation into neurons and glial cells within the 3D scaffolds in vivo. The iNSC-seeded scaffolds restored the continuity of the spinal cord and reduced cavity formation. Additionally, iNSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to functional recovery of the spinal cord.

We have shown that an artificial sealing of mechanically damaged membranes by topical application of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) immediately restores variable levels of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion. This was documented by a rapid recovery of somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) conduction, and by recovery of the cutaneous trunchi muscle (CTM) reflex in PEG-treated animals. The CTM reflex is a sensorimotor behavior dependent on an intact (and identified) white matter tract within the ventrolateral funiculus of the spinal cord, and is thus an excellent index of white matter integrity. We show that PEG can be safely introduced into the bloodstream by several routes of administration. Using a fluorescein decorated PEG, we demonstrate that the polymer specifically targets the hemorrhagic contusion of the adult guinea pig spinal cord when administered through the vasculature, but not intact regions of the spinal cord. A single subcutaneous injection (30% weight by weight in sterile saline) made 6 hr after a standardized spinal cord contusion in adult guinea pigs was sufficient to produce a rapid recovery of SSEP propagation through the lesion in only PEG-treated animals, accompanied by a statistically significant recovery of the CTM reflex.

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise.

In this study we tested the effects of PEG in vivo, to elucidate the mechanism of PEG-mediated neuroprotection. We show that a compression injury at T10-111 induced diffusive oxidative stress in crude synaptosomal preparations, correlated with synaptosomal dysfunction and increased intrasynaptosomal calcium. Administration of PEG immediately post-injury produced a marked decrease in synaptosomal oxidative stress and calcium, associated with an increase in synaptosomal function. Confocal microscopy using fluorescein conjugated PEG revealed that PEG entered the cells of the injured spinal cord, placing the polymer in a position to directly interact with cellular organelles. PEG attenuates calcium-induced functional compromise of normal spinal cord synaptosomes and mitochondria in vitro. These results indicate that EEG may exert its neuroprotective effect through direct interaction with mitochondria, besides its known ability to rescue neurons and their axons by repairing the plasma membranes. We submit that PEG is likely to interfere with the cascade of secondary injury by several mechanisms of action that in concert reduce oxidative stress."

To this end, we examined the penetration of intrathecally infused N-terminal pegylated BDNF (peg-BDNF) compared to similar infusion of native BDNF after spinal cord injury (SCI). Pegylation dramatically improved delivery of BDNF to the spinal cord and induced the expression of Fos in spinal cord neurons. To test whether enhanced delivery would improve the modest effects on behavioral recovery and axonal outgrowth observed with native BDNF infusion, we assessed the efficacy of 2-week 25-mug/day peg-BDNF treatment, beginning 12-24 h (early) or 15 days (delayed) after midthoracic spinal contusion. Similar to native BDNF, early treatment with peg-BDNF accelerated the recovery of stepping in the open-field and acutely stimulated locomotor central pattern generator activity, as seen by the activation of hindlimb airstepping during either period of administration. The infusion of peg-BDNF, regardless of the timing of delivery, was related to enhanced sprouting of putative cholinergic fibers, like that observed after high dose native BDNF treatment. Despite improved delivery, however, neither axonal responses nor the extent of locomotor recovery were enhanced compared to native BDNF treatment. This suggests that alternative strategies, such as neurotrophin treatment in conjunction with cell transplantation techniques, or treatment nearer the cell bodies of target neurons might be employed in an attempt to effect significant repair after SCI.

Intravenously injected micelles effectively recovered locomotor function and reduced the volume and inflammatory response of the lesion in injured rats, without any adverse effects. Our results show that copolymer micelles can interrupt the spread of primary spinal cord injury damage with minimal toxicity."

This is a debilitating neurological disorder common in young adults that often requires life-long therapy and rehabilitative care, placing a significant burden on our healthcare system. While no cure exists, research has identified various pharmacological compounds that specifically antagonize primary and secondary mechanisms contributing to the etiology of ASCI. Several compounds including methylprednisotone (MPSS), GM-1 ganglioside, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), nimodipine, and gacyclidine have been tested in prospective randomized clinical trials of ASCI. MPSS and GM-1 ganglioside have shown evidence of modest benefits. Clearly trials of improved neuroprotective agents are required. Promising potential therapies for ASCI include riluzole, minocycline, erythropoietin, and the fusogen polyethylene glycol, as well as mild hypothermia."

In this work, chitosan has been demonstrated to seal compromised nerve cell membranes thus serving as a potent neuroprotector following acute spinal cord trauma. Topical application of chitosan after complete transection or compression of the guinea pig spinal cord facilitated sealing of neuronal membranes in ex vivo tests, and restored the conduction of nerve impulses through the length of spinal cords in vivo, using somatosensory evoked potential recordings. Moreover, chitosan preferentially targeted damaged tissues, served as a suppressor of reactive oxygen species ( free radical) generation, and the resultant lipid peroxidation of membranes, as shown in ex vivo spinal cord samples. These findings suggest a novel medical approach to reduce the catastrophic loss of behavior after acute spinal cord and brain injury."

Filling this cavity with a growth-permissive substrate would likely promote regeneration and repair. Single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with polyethylene glycol (SWNT-PEG) have been shown to increase the length of selected neurites in vitro. We hypothesized that administration of SWNT-PEG after experimental SCI will promote regeneration of axons into the lesion cavity and functional recovery of the hindlimbs. To evaluate this hypothesis, complete transection SCI was induced at the T9 vertebral level in adult female rats. One week after transection, the epicenter of the lesion was injected with 25 mu L of either vehicle (saline), or 1 mu g/mL, 10 mu g/mL, or 100 mu g/mL of SWNT-PEG. Behavioral analysis was conducted before injury, before treatment, and once every 7 days for 28 days after treatment. At 28 days post-injection the rats were euthanized and spinal cord tissue was extracted. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the area of the cyst, the extent of the glial scar, and axonal morphology. We found that post-SCI administration of SWNT-PEG decreased lesion volume, increased neurofilament-positive fibers and corticospinal tract fibers in the lesion, and did not increase reactive gliosis. Additionally, post-SCI administration of SWNT-PEG induced a modest improvement in hindlimb locomotor recovery without inducing hyperalgesia. These data suggest that SWNT-PEG may be an effective material to promote axonal repair and regeneration after SCI."

In this study, we used immunoblotting techniques to detect the accumulation of protein-bound acrolein and HNE. We report that protein-bound acrolein and HNE were significantly increased in guinea pig spinal cord following a controlled compression injury. The acrolein and HNE protein-adducts increased in the damaged spinal cord as early as 4 h after injury, reached a peak at 24 h after injury, and remained at a significantly high level up to 7 days after injury. Such increase of protein adducts was also observed in the adjacent segments of the injury site beginning at 24 h post injury. These results suggest that products of lipid peroxidation, especially acrolein, may play a critical role in the secondary neuronal degeneration, which follows mechanical insults."

Furthermore, a brief (2 min) application of the fusogen (M-r 1800, 50 % w/v aqueous solution) to the exposed spinal cord injury in vivo can also cause rapid recovery of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion in association with functional recovery. Behavioral recovery was demonstrated using a long-tract, spinal-cord-dependent behavior in rodents known as the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) reflex. This reflex is observed as a contraction of the skin of the back in response to tactile stimulation. Here, we confirm and extend these preliminary observations. A severe compression/contusion injury to the exposed thoracic spinal cord of the guinea pig was performed between thoracic vertebrae 10 and 11. Approximately 7 h later, a topical application of PEG was made to the injury (dura removed) for 2 min in 15 experimental animals, and levels of recovery were compared with those of 13 vehicle-treated control animals. In PEG-treated animals, 93 % recovered variable levels of CTM functioning and all recovered some level of conduction through the lesion, as measured by evoked potential techniques. The recovered reflex was relatively normal compared with the quantitative characteristics of the reflex prior to injury with respect to the direction, distance and velocity of skin contraction. Only 23 % of the control population showed any spontaneous CTM recovery (P=0.0003) and none recovered conduction through the lesion during the 1 month period of observation (P=0.0001). These results suggest that repair of nerve membranes by polymeric sealing can provide a novel means for the rapid restoration of function following spinal cord injury."

Similar studies were conducted using a related co-polymer Poloxamer 188 (P 188). Here we carried out initial investigations of an intravenous application of PEG or P 188 (3500 Daltons, 30 70 w/w in saline; 2 mL/kg I.V. and 2 mL/kg body weight or 300 mL P 188 per kg, respectively) to neurologically complete cases of paraplegia in dogs. Our aim was to first determine if this is a clinically safe procedure in cases of severe naturally occurring SCI in dogs. Secondarily, we wanted to obtain preliminary evidence if this therapy could be of clinical benefit when compared to a larger number of similar, but historical, control cases. Strict entry criteria permitted recruitment of only neurologically complete paraplegic dogs into this study. Animals were treated by a combination of conventional and experimental techniques within similar to72 h of admission for spinal trauma secondary to acute, explosive disk herniation. Outcome measures consisted of measurements of voluntary ambulation, deep and superficial pain perception, conscious proprioception in hindlimbs, and evoked potentials (somatosensory evoked potentials [SSEP]). We determined that polymer injection is a safe adjunct to the conventional management of severe neurological injury in dogs. We did not observe any unacceptable clinical response to polymer injection; there were no deaths, nor any other problem arising from, or associated with, the procedures. Outcome measures over the 6-8-week trial were improved by polymer injection when compared to historical cases. This recovery was unexpectedly rapid compared to these comparator groups. The results of this pilot trial provides evidence consistent with the notion that the injection of inorganic polymers in acute neurotrauma may be a simple and useful intervention during the acute phase of the injury."

Activation of microglia/macrophages and the associated inflammatory response appears to be a self-propelling mechanism that leads to progressive neurodegeneration and development of persisting pain state. Recent advances in polymer science have provided a huge amount of innovations leading to increased interest for polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery tools to treat SCI. In this study, we tested and evaluated in vitro and in vivo a new drug delivery nanocarrier: minocycline loaded in NPs composed by a polymer based on poly-e-caprolactone and polyethylene glycol. These NPs are able to selectively target and modulate, specifically, the activated proinflammatory microglia/macrophages in subacute progression of the secondary injury in SCI mouse model. After minocycline-NPs treatment, we demonstrate a reduced activation and proliferation of microglia/macrophages around the lesion site and a reduction of cells with round shape phagocytic-like phenotype in favor of a more arborized resting-like phenotype with low CD68 staining. Treatment here proposed limits, up to 15 days tested, the proinflammatory stimulus associated with microglia/macrophage activation. This was demonstrated by reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and persistent reduced expression of CD68 in traumatized site. The nanocarrier drug delivery tool developed here shows potential advantages over the conventionally administered anti-inflammatory therapy, maximizing therapeutic efficiency and reducing side effects."

Using an in vitro guinea pig spinal cord injury model, we have shown that polyethylene glycol (PEG), a hydrophilic polymer, can significantly accelerate and enhance the membrane resealing process to restore membrane integrity following controlled compression. As a result of PEG treatment, injury-induced ROS elevation and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were significantly suppressed. We further show that PEG is not an effective free radical scavenger nor does it have the ability to suppress xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme in generating superoxide. These observations suggest that it is the PEG-mediated membrane repair that leads to ROS and LPO inhibition. Furthermore, our data also imply an important causal effect of membrane disruption in generating ROS in spinal cord injury, suggesting membrane repair to be an effective target in reducing ROS genesis."

In this article, we systematically review the available pre-clinical research on such neuroprotective therapies that are administered in a non-invasive manner for acute SCI. Specifically, we review treatments that have a relatively high potential for translation due to the fact that they are already used in human clinical applications, or are available in a form that could be administered to humans. These include: erythropoietin, NSAIDs, anti-CD11d antibodies, minocycline, progesterone, estrogen, magnesium, riluzole, polyethylene glycol, atorvastatin, inosine, and pioglitazone. The literature was systematically reviewed to examine studies in which an in-vivo animal model was utilized to assess the efficacy of the therapy in a traumatic SCI paradigm. Using these criteria, 122 studies were identified and reviewed in detail. Wide variations exist in the animal species, injury models, and experimental designs reported in the pre-clinical literature on the therapies reviewed. The review highlights the extent of investigation that has occurred in these specific therapies, and points out gaps in our knowledge that would be potentially valuable prior to human translation."

The pathobiology of SCI involves a primary mechanical insult to the spinal cord and activation of a delayed secondary cascade of events, which ultimately causes progressive degeneration of the spinal cord. Whereas cell death from the mechanical injury is predominated by necrosis, secondary injury events trigger a continuum of necrotic and apoptotic cell death mechanisms. These secondary events include vascular abnormalities, ischemia-reperfusion, glutamate excitotoxicity and disturbances in ionic homeostasis, oxidative cell injury, and a robust inflammatory response. No gold standard therapy for SCI has been established, although clinical trials with methylprednisolone (NASCIS II and III) and GM-1 ganglioside (Maryland and Sygen) have demonstrated modest, albeit potentially important therapeutic benefits. In light of the overwhelming impact of SCI on the individual, other therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. A number of promising pharmacological therapies are currently under investigation for neuroprotective abilities in animal models of SCI. These include the sodium (Na+) channel blocker riluzole, the tetracycline derivative minocycline, the fusogen copolymer polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the tissue-protective hormone erythropoietin (EPO). Moreover, clinical trials investigating the putative neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties ascribed to the Rho pathway antagonist, Cethrin (R) (BioAxone Therapeutic, Inc.), and implantation of activated autologous macrophages (ProCord (R); Proneuron Biotechnologies) in patients with thoracic and cervical SCI are now underway. We anticipate that these studies will harken an era of renewed interest in translational clinical trials. Ultimately, due to the multi-factorial pathophysiology of traumatic SCI, effective therapies will require combined approaches."

After the spinal cord injury, the animals were randomly distributed into five groups of five animals each: one group received placebo 8 hours after injury and the remaining four groups received prednisone at 8, 24, 48, and 120 hours after injury. Prednisone was applied at 2mg/ kg dosage during five days and progressively reduced until the 26th day. Animals were evaluated by motor capacity, proprioceptive positioning, locating reflex, inclined plan, and sensibility to pain. The animals were sacrificed 33 days after surgery for histological study of the spinal cords that revealed degeneration of the rootlets, necrosis, inflammatory foci, and reactive gliosis, with no significant differences among the treated groups. The administration of high dosages of prednisone to animals with acute spinal cord injury had no deleterious effects on neurological recovery, even when used late."

However, the mechanism remains unclear. Thus, we established a rat model of acute spinal cord injury using a modified version of Allen's method. Jisuikang (50, 25, and 12.5 g/kg/d) and prednisolone were administered 30 minutes after anesthesia. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale scores and the oblique board test showed improved motor function recovery in the prednisone group and moderate-dose Jisuikang group compared with the other groups at 3-7 days post-injury. The rats in the moderate-dose Jisuikang group recovered best at 14 days post-injury. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that the survival rate of neurons in treatment groups increased after 3-7 days of administration. Further, the structure of neurons and glial cells was more distinct, especially in prednisolone and moderate-dose Jisuikang groups. Western blot assay and immunohistochemistry showed that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in injured segments was maintained at a high level after 7-14 days of treatment. In contrast, expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was down-regulated at 7 days after spinal cord injury. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of BDNF and NGF mRNA was induced in injured segments by prednisolone and Jisuikang. At 3-7 days after injury, the effect of prednisolone was greater, while 14 days after injury, the effect of moderate-dose Jisuikang was greater. These results confirm that Jisuikang can upregulate BDNF and NGF expression for a prolonged period after spinal cord injury and promote repair of acute spinal cord injury, with its effect being similar to prednisolone."

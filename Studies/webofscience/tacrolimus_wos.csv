Interestingly, it has been reported that FK506 increases neurite outgrowth in cell cultures, implying a potential impact in putative treatments of neurodegenerative disorders and injuries of the nervous system. Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of this compound is poorly understood and remains to be elucidated, with the only certainty that its neurotrophic effect is independent of its primary immunosuppressant activity. In this study it is demonstrated that FK506 shows efficient neurotrophic action in vitro and profound effects on the recovery of locomotor activity, behavioural features, and erectile function of mice that underwent surgical spinal cord injury. The recovery of the locomotor activity was studied in knock-out mice for either immunophilin, FKBP51 or FKBP52. The experimental evidence demonstrates that the neurotrophic actions of FK506 are the consequence of its binding to FKBP52, whereas FK506 interaction with the close-related partner immunophilin FKBP51 antagonises the function of FKBP52. Importantly, our study also demonstrates that other immunophilins do not replace FKBP52. It is concluded that the final biological response is the resulting outcome of the drug binding to both immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, the latter being the one that commands the dominant neurotrophic action in vivo."

In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure."

At 8 and 12 weeks after surgery, brain injury induction and/or tacrolimus treatment increased action potential amplitude in the sciatic nerve trunk. Horseradish peroxidase retrograde tracing revealed that the number of horseradish peroxidase-positive neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord was greatly increased. Brain injury in combination with tacrolimus exhibited better effects on repair of injured peripheral nerves than brain injury or tacrolimus alone.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=56) were used to establish moderate SCI models, which were induced at the T10 spinal segment by dropping a 10-g weight from a height of 25 mm using a New York University Impactor device. The rats were randomly separated into the FK506 or control group (n=28 per group). Rats were treated with FK506 (0.5 mg/kg) or saline intravenously 30 min after sustaining the injury. Functional recovery was evaluated over 42 days following the injury, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels were detected. The astrocytes were treated with FK506 in vitro, and the EGF mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA, respectively. DNA microarray analysis was also performed to evaluate the genes in astrocytes. Rats in the FK506 group had improved locomotor functional recovery compared with those of control group. Furthermore, FK506 upregulated EGF expression of astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro. Subsequent to treatment with FK506-conditioned medium (CM), the length of neuronal cells increased 61.06% on the first day, and increased 56.4% on the third day compared with those of C-CM group. Furthermore, addition of anti-EGF neutralizing antibodies could interrupt the promotion of neurite outgrowth by FK506-CM. The present study indicates that astrocytes have an important role as mediators of FK506-improved spinal cord function recovery, and this partially clarifies the role of cell-cell interaction through modulating EGF in this process."

In the present study, our goal was to investigate the effect of FK506 on functional recovery of the sciatic nerve after focal ischemia, produced by stripping of the epineurial vessels. A total number of 48 Wistar rats were used for this purpose and divided into four groups (control, sham-operated, FK506-treated, and Vehicle-treated). Sciatic nerves were approached by femoral and gluteal muscle splitting. Then, epineurial vessels around the sciatic nerve were stripped in the FK506-treated and Vehicle-treated groups. After operation, 5mg/kg/day FK506 administration was initiated by subcutaneous injection until animal sacrifice. The same volume of saline was administrated to the vehicle-treated group. The functional and sensory recoveries were tested by walking pattern analysis and pinch test in every postoperative week. The animals were sacrificed in the end of the fourth postoperative week and sciatic nerve samples were harvested and processed for electron microscopic evaluation. Our data revealed that FK506 administration showed beneficial effect on subperineurial degeneration/demyelinization from functional, sensorial, and ultrastructural points of view. The sciatic nerve samples in the FK506-treated group had several remyelinated fibers compared to the vehicle-treated group. Our literature searches revealed that FK506 administration has not, to our knowledge, been studied in focal ischemic degeneration produced by stripping of the epineurial vessels."

In a single-site, phase I study, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of NSI-566 transplantation for the treatment of hemiparesis due to chronic motor stroke and determined the maximum tolerated dose for future trials. Three cohorts (n = 3 per cohort) were transplanted with one-time intracerebral injections of 1.2 x 10(7), 2.4 x 10(7), or 7.2 x 10(7) cells. Immunosuppression therapy with tacrolimus was maintained for 28 days. All subjects had sustained chronic motor strokes, verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), initiated between 5 and 24 months prior to surgery with modified Rankin Scores [MRSs] of 2, 3, or 4 and Fugl-Meyer Motor Scores of 55 or less. At the 12-month visit, the mean Fugl-Meyer Motor Score (FMMS, total score of 100) for the nine participants showed 16 points of improvement (p = .0078), the mean MRS showed 0.8 points of improvement (p = .031), and the mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale showed 3.1 points of improvement (p = .020). For six participants who were followed up for 24 months, these mean changes remained stable. The treatment was well tolerated at all doses. Longitudinal MRI studies showed evidence indicating cavity-filling by new neural tissue formation in all nine patients.

Vehicle-treated rats developed significant and long-lasting hind paw hypersensitivity to innocuous mechanical stimulation, noxious heat and cooling stimuli. In contrast, FK506 treatment reduced the duration of both mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. Neither treated groups demonstrated an improvement in locomotor function.

A 1-cm segment of left peroneal nerve was cut out and immediately autografted in an inverted position. After surgery, the animals were treated with FK506 (1.2 mg/kg/d) via an osmotic pump and compared to untreated animals. Recovery of use of the injured leg was assessed weekly for 12 weeks using a walking track apparatus and a camcorder. At the end of this period, motor and metabosensitive responses of the regenerated axons were recorded and histological analysis was performed. We observed that FK506 significantly: (1) increased the diameter of regenerated axons in the distal portion of the graft; (2) improved the responses of sensory neurons to metabolites such as potassium chloride and lactic acid; and (3) induced a fast-to-slow-fiber-type transition of the tibialis anterior muscle. Taken together, these data indicate that FK506 potentiates metabosensitive nerve fiber regeneration. Pharmacological studies of various dosages and concentrations of FK506 are required before recommending this drug for therapeutic treatment of nerve injuries."

Above-elbow arm transplantation is probably technically simpler than distal forearm or wrist transplantation, especially since. the macroanastomoses do not require microsurgical expertise. However, hand function depends on reinnervation of forearm muscles and the distance for nerves to regenerate for reinnervation of intrinsic muscles of the hand is significant. The vascularized bone marrow transplanted with the arm holds potential to induce chimerism and promote tolerance but could also make the recipient more susceptible to graft-versus-host disease. Prospective trials comparing the functional results after above-elbow arm transplantation with the functional results achieved by the best neuronal-controlled above-elbow prosthesis are warranted and will determine the gold standard of upper-extremity reconstruction."

The combination of FTY720 and tacrolimus has been reported to elicit synergistic immunosuppresive effects in rat allograft models without causing critical adverse effects. This study was to determine whether the combination of FTY720 and tacrolimus is superior to FTY720 or tacrolimus alone in the treatment of SCI. Forty-eight rats were subjected to a weight-drop contusion at the tenth thoracic level (a 10-g rod dropped from a height of 25 mm). At 30 min after the operation, they were randomly divided into four groups and received treatment with either FTY720 (0.5 mg/kg), tacrolimus (0.5 mg/kg), FTY720 + tacrolimus (0.5 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg respectively) or saline via gavage. Functional recovery was evaluated during 42 days after SCI via open-field test, inclined plane test, footprint analysis, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and electron microscopic analysis. Rats from three treatment groups showed significantly better locomotor functional outcomes, higher SSEP amplitude, shorter SSEP latency, and milder pathological changes compared with those of control group. Moreover, rats treated with a combination of FTY720 and tacrolimus demonstrated significantly greater functional recovery by day 14 after SCI than those treated with either FTY720 or tacrolimus alone.

The study investigated whether FK506 would retain its neuroregenerative properties when nerve repair and initiation of FK506 therapy were delayed for 7 days. Study Design: In vivo laboratory study. Methods: Thirty-two Lewis rats underwent tibial nerve transection and were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: immediate repair with FK506 treatment, immediate repair without FK506 treatment, 7-day delayed repair with FK506 treatment, and 7-day delayed repair without FK506 treatment. Treated animals received daily subcutaneous injections of 2 mg/kg FK506. Serial walking track measurements were performed at 14,16, and 18 days after nerve repair. On day 18 after repair, peripheral nerves were injected with a fluorescent tracer for retrograde labeling. On day 21, peripheral nerves and spinal cords were harvested for histomorphometric analysis and motor neuron cell body counts, respectively. Results: Animals that underwent immediate repair with FK506 had significantly higher fiber counts and percentages of nerve than the other three groups (P < .05) but did not show statistically significant earlier functional recovery. The remaining three groups had intermediate levels of nerve regeneration that were not significantly different. Retrograde abled motor neurons counts were decreased in animals with delayed nerve repair that received no FK506 (P < .05).

Young adult male rats were subjected to experimental SCI by weight compression method. Minocycline (50 mg/kg) and FK506 (1 mg/kg) were administered orally in combination and individually to the SCI group daily for three weeks. During these three weeks, the recovery was measured using behavioral motor parameters (including BBB, Tarlov and other scorings) every other day for 29 days after SCI. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the segment of the spinal cord centered at the injury site was removed for the histopathological studies as well as for biochemical analysis of monoamines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and some oxidative stress indices, such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TSARS), total glutathione (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). All behavioral results indicated that both drugs induced significant recovery from SCI with respect to time. The biochemical and histopathological results supported the behavioral findings, revealing significant recovery in the regeneration of the injured spinal tissues, the monoamine levels, and the oxidative stress indices. Overall, the effects of the tested drugs for SCI recovery were as follows: FK506 + minocycline > minocycline > FK506 in all studied parameters. Thus, minocycline and FK506 may prove to be a potential therapy cocktail to treat acute SCI. However, further studies are warranted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved."

Geldanamycin (GA), a non-immunosuppressive agent, shares a common binding target (heat shock protein 90) with FK-506 and may accelerate nerve regeneration through a similar mechanism. GA has been shown to augment neurite outgrowth in vitro but has not been tested in vivo. The current study investigated the effect of GA on the rate of axonal regeneration and functional recovery following peripheral nerve injury. In the first experiment, Thyl-GFP transgenic rats underwent serial transmuscular imaging to quantify the rate of axonal regeneration following saphenous nerve crush injury. In subsequent experiments, Lewis rats underwent tibial nerve crush or transection-and-repair injuries and were assessed for functional recovery by walking track analysis. All animals were randomized to receive daily administration of FK-506 (2 mg/kg), GA (0.2 mg/kg), or a control vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 mL/kg) starting 3 days prior to injury. Both GA and FK-506 significantly increased the rate of axonal regeneration following crush injury in Thy1-GFP rats. In Lewis rats undergoing tibial nerve crush injury, earlier functional recovery occurred at day 5 and day 6 in animals treated with FK-506 and GA respectively, vs. day 13 for controls. Over a truncated 21-day timeframe, Lewis rats undergoing tibial nerve transection-and-repair injury and treated with FK-506 regained function at day 16, whereas those treated with GA or the control vehicle did not regain normal function. GA-treated animals, however, did exhibit significant functional improvement vs. controls. The current study demonstrated that GA accelerates axonal regeneration and enhances functional recovery in vivo. Its ability to increase the rate at which peripheral axons regenerate is comparable to that of FK-506. GA, however, did not match the performance of FK-506 in injury models where Wallerian degeneration (WD) is ongoing in the distal stump. This provides evidence that FK-506 accelerates axonal regeneration through two parallel mechanisms: the first being its well-established effect on neurons; the second is likely a newly described, as-yet poorly defined mechanism that affects WD.

The biological function of FK-506 in the spinal cord has not been fully elucidated. To clarify the anti-inflammatory action of FK-506 in spinal cord injury (SCI), we performed an acute spinal cord contusion injury model in adult rats and hypoxia-treated primary spinal cord microglia cultures. This work studied the activation of NF-kappa B and proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6) expression. ELISA and q-PCR analysis revealed that TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 levels significantly increased 3 days after spinal cord contusion and decreased after 14 days, accompanied by the increased activation of NF-kappa B. This increase was reversed by an FK-506 treatment. Double immunofluorescence labeling suggested that NF-kappa B activation was especially prominent in microglia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed no alteration in the number of microglia. Moreover, the results in hypoxia-treated primary spinal cord microglia confirmed the effect of FK-506 on TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 expression and NF-kappa B activation. These findings suggest that FK-506 may be involved in microglial activation after SCI."

Other neurotrophic immunophilin ligands that do not exhibit immunosuppression have subsequently been developed and studied in various models of nerve injury. This article reviews the literature on the use of tacrolimus and other immunophilin ligands in peripheral nerve, cranial nerve and spinal cord injuries. The most convincing evidence of enhanced nerve regeneration is seen with systemic administration of tacrolimus in peripheral nerve injury, although clinical use is limited due to its immunosuppressive side effects. Local tacrolimus delivery to the site of nerve repair in peripheral and cranial nerve injury is less effective but requires further investigation. Tacrolimus can enhance outcomes in nerve allograft reconstruction and accelerates reinnervation of complex functional allograft transplants. Other non-immunosuppressive immunophilins ligands such as V-10367 and FK1706 demonstrate enhanced neuroregeneration in the peripheral nervous system and CNS. Mixed results are found in the application of immunophilin ligands to treat spinal cord injury. Immunophilin ligands have great potential in the treatment of nerve injury, but further preclinical studies are necessary to permit translation into clinical trials."

We investigated whether immunosuppressants can exert direct effects on the differentiation, proliferation, survival, and migration of human central nervous system-derived stem cells propagated as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) in vitro and in an in vivo model of spinal cord injury. We identified unique, immunosuppressant-dependent effects on hCNS-SCns differentiation and proliferation in vitro. All immunosuppressants tested increased neuronal differentiation, and CsA and rapamycin inhibited proliferation in vitro. No immunosuppressant-mediated effects on hCNS-SCns survival or migration in vitro were detected. These data suggested that immunosuppressant administration could alter hCNS-SCns properties in vivo. We tested this hypothesis by administering immunosuppressants to constitutively immunodeficient spinal cord injured mice and assessed survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of hCNS-SCns after 14 weeks. In parallel, we administered immunosuppressants to immunocompetent spinal cord injury (SCI) mice and also evaluated hCNS-SCns engraftment and fate. We identified no effect of immunosuppressants on the overall hCNS-SCns fate profile in either xenotransplantation model. Despite a lower level of human cell engraftment in immunocompetent SCI mice, functional locomotor recovery was observed in animals receiving hCNS-SCns transplantation with no evidence of allodynia. These data suggest that local cues in the microenvironment could exert a stronger influence on hCNS-SCns than circulating levels of immunosuppressants; however, differences between human and rodent metabolism/pharmokinetics and xenograft versus allograft paradigms could be determining factors."

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to investigate the effect of iPSC-based therapy on functional recovery after SCI using pharmacologically immunosuppressed, immunocompetent animal models. Here we studied the functional outcome following subacute transplantation of human iPSC-derived NPCs into contused mouse spinal cord when tacrolimus was used as an immunosuppressive agent. We show that human iPSC-derived NPCs transplanted into pharmacologically immunosuppressed C57BL/6J mice exhibited poor long-term survival and failed to improve functional recovery after SCI as measured by Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) for locomotion and CatWalk gait analysis when compared to vehicle-treated animals.

In the present study, common marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group).

Immunoelectron microscopic examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control group.

While immunosuppression is mediated by the 12-kD FK506-binding-protein (FKBP-12), the neurite elongation activity of FK506 involves FKBP-52 (also known as FKBP-59 or Hsp-56), a component of mature steroid receptor complexes: FKBP-52 binds to Hsp-90, which bind to p23 and the steroid receptor protein to form the complex. The brief review focuses on how three classes of compounds (FK506 derivatives, steroid hormones, and ansamycin anti-cancer drugs, e.g., geldanamycin) increase neurite elongation/nerve regeneration (axonal elongation). A model is presented whereby neurite elongation is elicited by compounds that bind to steroid receptor chaperone proteins (e.g., FKBP-52 and Hsp-90) and thereby disrupt mature steroid receptor complexes (comprising FKBP-52, Hsp-90 and p23 in addition to the steroid receptor binding protein). Disruption of the complex leads to a ""gain-of function"" whereby one or more of these steroid receptor chaperone proteins (i.e, FKBP-52, Hsp-90 or p23) activates mitogen-associated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Thus, the neurotrophic actions of these distinct classes of compounds can be understood from their ability to bind steroid receptor chaperones, thereby providing a unique receptor-mediated means to activate the ERK pathway. These studies thereby shed new light on the intrinsic mechanism regulating axonal elongation. Furthermore, this mechanism may also underlie calcineurin-independent neuroprotective actions of FK506. We suggest that components of steroid receptor complexes are novel targets for the design of neuroregenerative/neuroprotective drugs."

Another FKBP-18 ligand (V-10,367) had similar effects on GAP-43 expression and functional outcome, indicating that the observed effects of tacrolimus do not involve inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin. Thus, tacrolimus, a drug which is already approved for use in humans, as well as other FKBP-12 ligands which do not inhibit calcineurin, could potentially enhance functional outcome after CNS injury in humans.

It is still under debate whether activated microglia promote neuronal survival, or whether they exacerbate the original extent of neuronal damage. Protagonists of the view that microglial cells cause secondary damage have proposed that inhibition of microglial activation by immunosuppression is beneficial after acute CNS damage. It is the aim of this review to analyse the effects of immunosuppressants on isolated microglial cells and neurons, and to scrutinize the effects of immunosuppression in different in vivo models of acute CNS trauma or ischemia. It is found that the immunosuppressants cytosine-arabinoside, different steroids, cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, and minocycline all have direct inhibitory effects on microglial cells. These effects are mainly exerted by inhibiting microglial proliferation or microglial secretion of neurotoxic substances such as proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. Furthermore, immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia results in improved structure preservation and, mostly, in enhanced function. However, all investigated immunosuppressants also have direct effects on neurons, and some immunosuppressants affect other glial cells such as astrocytes. In summary, it is safe to conclude that immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia is neuroprotective. Furthermore, circumferential evidence indicates that microglial activation after traumatic or ischemic CNS damage is not beneficial to adjacent neurons in the immediate aftermath of such acute lesions. Further experiments with more specific agents or genetic approaches that specifically inhibit microglial cells are needed in order to fully answer the question of whether microglial activation is ""good or bad"".

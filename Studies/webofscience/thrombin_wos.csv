Here we demonstrate that the spinal cord of mice consuming HFHS expresses reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor and shows impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle function, reductions in PLP and increases in astrogliosis, all prior to SCI. After SCI, Western diet impaired sensorimotor and bladder recovery, increased microgliosis, exacerbated oligodendrocyte loss and reduced axon sprouting. Direct and indirect neural injury mechanisms are suggested since HFHS culture conditions drove parallel injury responses directly and indirectly after culture with conditioned media from HFHS-treated astrocytes. In each case, injury mechanisms included reductions in IGF-1R, SIRT1 and PGC-1 alpha and were prevented by metformin. Results highlight the potential for a Western diet to evoke signs of neural insulin resistance and injury and metformin as a strategy to improve mechanisms of neural neuroprotection and repair."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) may be administered by autologous transplantation, avoiding immunologic challenges. Identifying strategies to optimize iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiNPC) for cell transplantation is an important objective. Herein, we report a method that takes advantage of the growth factor-like and anti-inflammatory activities of the fibrinolysis protease, tissue plasminogen activator tPA, without effects on hemostasis. We demonstrate that conditioning hiNPC with enzymatically-inactive tissue-type plasminogen activator (El-tPA), prior to grafting into a T3 lesion site in a clinically relevant severe SCI model, significantly improves motor outcomes. El-tPA-primed hiNPC grafted into lesion sites survived, differentiated, acquired markers of motor neuron maturation, and extended beta III-tubulin-positive axons several spinal segments below the lesion. Importantly, only SCI rats that received El-tPA primed hiNPC demonstrated significantly improved motor function, without exacerbating pain. When hiNPC were treated with El-tPA in culture, NMDA-R-dependent cell signaling was initiated, expression of genes associated with stemness (Nestin, Sox2) was regulated, and thrombin-induced cell death was prevented. El-tPA emerges as a novel agent capable of improving the efficacy of stem cell therapy in SCI."

Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury. However, its underlying mechanism of action remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the mechanism by which batroxobin participates in the activation of astrocytes is associated with Sirt1. Mouse models of nigrostriatal pathway injury were established. Immediately after modeling, mice were intraperitoneally administered 39 U/kg batroxobin. Batroxobin significantly reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in both the substantia nigra and striatum, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, and promoted the recovery of rat locomotor function. These changes coincided with a remarkable reduction in astrocyte activation. Batroxobin also reduced Sirt1 expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in brain tissue. Intraperitoneal administration of the Sirt1-specific inhibitor EX527 (5 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to injury could inhibit the abovementioned effects. In mouse astrocyte cultures, 1 ng/mL batroxobin attenuated interleukin-1 beta-induced activation of astrocytes and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. EX527 could also inhibit the effects of batroxobin. These findings suggest that batroxobin inhibits astrocyte activation after nigrostriatal pathway injury through the Sirt1 pathway.

In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure."

Although the working mechanism of PAR-1 is becoming clear, the functional role of PAR-1 and its correlation with APC in the injured spinal cord remains to be elucidated. Here we investigated if PAR-1 and APC are determinants of long-term functional recovery after a spinal cord contusive injury using PAR-1 null and wildtype mice. We found that neutrophil infiltration and disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier were significantly reduced in spinal cord injured PAR-1 null mice relative to the wild-type group. Both locomotor recovery and ability to descend an inclined grid were significantly improved in the PAR-1 null group 42 days after injury and this improvement was associated with greater long-term sparing of white matter and a reduction in glial scarring. Wild-type mice treated with APC acutely after injury showed a similar level of improved locomotor recovery to that of PAR-1 null mice. However, improvement of APC-treated PAR-1 null mice was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated PAR-1 null mice, suggesting that APC acts through PAR-1. Collectively, our findings define a detrimental role of thrombin-activated PAR-1 in wound healing and further validate APC, also acting through the PAR-1 by biased agonism, as a promising therapeutic target for spinal cord injury."

However, the CNS seems to have limited tissue resilience to withstand the detrimental effects of uncontrolled inflammation compromising functional recovery and tissue repair. Newly described neuro-immune-regulators (NIREGs) are functionally related proteins regulating the severity and duration of the host inflammatory response. NIREGs such as CD200, CD47 and CX3CL1 are vital for increasing tissue resilience and are constitutively expressed by neurons. The interaction with co-receptors (CD200R, CD172a, CX3CR1) will maintain microglia in the resting phenotype, directing aggressive microglia phenotype and limiting bystander injuries. Neurons can also express many of the complement NIREGs (CD55, CD46, CD59 and factor H). Neurons and glia also express suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) down regulating janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and to lead to the polarization of microglia towards anti-inflammatory phenotype. Other NIREGs such as serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and thrombomodulin (CD141) inhibit neurotoxic systemic coagulation proteins such as thrombin. The unfolded protein response (UPR) detects misfolded proteins and other stressors to prevent irreversible cell injury. Microglial pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (TREM-2, CR3, Fc gamma R) are important to clear apoptotic cells and cellular debris but in non-phlogystic manner through inhibitory signaling pathways. The TYRO3, Axl, Mer (TAM) tyrosine receptor kinases activated by Gas 6 and PROS1 regulate inflammation by inhibiting Toll like receptors (TLR) /JAK-STAT activation and contribute to NIREG's functions."

During development, PRG3 is ubiquitously located at the tip of neuronal processes and at the plasma membrane and declines with age. In utero electroporation of PRG3 induced dendritic protrusions and accelerated spine formations in cortical pyramidal neurons. The neurite growth promoting activity of PRG3 requires RasGRF1 (RasGEF1/Cdc25) mediated downstream signaling. Moreover, in axon collapse assays, PRG3-induced neurites resisted growth inhibitors such as myelin, Nogo-A (Reticulon/RTN-4), thrombin and LPA and impeded the RhoA-Rock-PIP5K induced neurite repulsion. Transgenic adult mice with constitutive PRG3 expression displayed strong axonal sprouting distal to a spinal cord lesion. Moreover, fostered PRG3 expression promoted complex motor-behavioral recovery compared to wild type controls as revealed in the Schnell swim test (SST). Thus, PRG3 emerges as a developmental RasGRF1-dependent conductor of filopodia formation and axonal growth enhancer. PRG3-induced neurites resist brain injury-associated outgrowth inhibitors and contribute to functional recovery after spinal cord lesions. Here, we provide evidence that PRG3 operates as an essential neuronal growth promoter in the nervous system. Maintaining PRG3 expression in aging brain may turn back the developmental clock for neuronal regeneration and plasticity."

We studied the effect of silencing these proteins in OEGs on their capacity to promote the regeneration of severed adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) axons. Our results support the role of glial PAI-1 as a downstream effector of PAR-1 in promoting axon regeneration. In contrast, we found that TM inhibits OEG induced-axonal regeneration. We also assessed the signaling pathways downstream of PAR-1 that might modulate PAI-1 expression, observing that specifically inhibiting G alpha(i), Rho kinase, or PLC and PKC downregulated the expression of PAI-1 in OEGs, with a concomitant reduction in OEG-dependent axon regeneration in adult RGCs.

In addition, we document changes in the astrocyte regulatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), and its signaling partner signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), in vivo and in vitro. Results demonstrate that GFAP expression is higher in the developing and adult spinal cord relative to brain. Comparisons between GFAP and ALDH1L1 expression suggest elevations in spinal cord GFAP during the early postnatal period reflect an accelerated appearance of astrocytes, while elevations in adulthood reflect higher expression by individual astrocytes. Notably, increases in spinal cord compared to whole brain GFAP were paralleled by higher levels of IL-6 and STAT3. Equivalent elevations in GFAP, GFAP/ALDH1L1 ratios, and in IL-6, were observed in primary astrocyte cultures derived from spinal cord compared to cortex. Also, higher levels of GFAP were observed in the spinal cord compared to the brain after focal demyelinating injury. Altogether, these studies point to key differences in astrocyte abundance and the expression of GFAP and IL-6 across the brain and spinal cord that are positioned to influence regional specialization developmentally and responses occurring in the context of injury and disease."

In this regard, intravenous activated protein C (aPC) improved neurologic outcomes in a rat compression spinal cord injury (SCI) model. Protein C activation occurs when the serine protease thrombin binds to the cell surface proteoglycan thrombomodulin (TM) forming a complex that halts coagulation. In culture, rTM blocks thrombin's activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), that mediate thrombin killing of neurons and glial reactivity. Both PARI and prothrombin are rapidly upregulated after contusion SCI in rats, prior to peak apoptosis. We now report neuroprotective effects of intraperitoneal soluble recombinant human rTM on open-field locomotor rating scale (BBB) and spinal cord lesion volume when given 1 h after SCI. BBB scores from four separate experiments showed a 7.6 +/- 1.4 absolute score increase (p < 0.05) at 3 days, that lasted throughout the time course. Histological sections at 14 days were even more dramatic where a twofold reduction in lesion volume was quantified in rTM-treated rats. Thionin staining revealed significant preservation of motor neuronal profiles both at, and two segments below, the lesion epicenter. Activated caspase-3 immunocytochemistry indicated apoptosis was quite prominent in motor neurons in vehicle (saline) controls, but was dramatically reduced by rTM. Microglia, increased and activated after injury, were reduced with rTM treatment. Taken together, these and previous results support a prominent role for coagulation-inflammation signaling cascades in the subacute changes following SCI. They identify a neuroprotective role for rTM by its inhibition of thrombin generation and blockade of PAR activation."

PAR1 knockout mice displayed improved locomotor recovery after SCI and reduced signatures of inflammation and astrogliosis, including expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, and STAT3 signaling.

We evaluated vascular endothelium reactivity in the lower limbs no longer submitted to the hydrostatic pressure of the erected position in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia and in 10 normal volunteers after venous occlusion produced by the application of 10 cm Hg pressure to the lower limb for 15 min comparatively to the upper limb used as reference.

After venostasis, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) increased significantly in both patients and controls in the upper limb (tPA levels twofold and threefold respectively in controls and patients) but showed no significant changes in the lower limb; prolonged immobility did not allow recovery in the lower limbs of a level of fibrinolytic responsiveness identical to that in the upper limbs. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI(1)) remained unchanged after anoxia, although wide interindividual variations were seen.

In this work, thrombin is shown to increase endogenous neural progenitor proliferation in the intact murine spinal cord. A local injection of heparin before a spinal cord injury reduces cell proliferation and astrogliogenesis associated with scarring. We sought to create depot-formulations of PLGA microsphere and Pluronic F-127 for sustained local delivery of two thrombin inhibitors, heparin and hirudin. Each hydrogel depot-formulation showed delayed drug release compared to microspheres or hydrogel alone. Animals with a lateral demyelination lesion showed a reduction in CD68+ macrophages when treated with hirudin-loaded PLGA/F-127 gels compared to control and heparin-treated animals. Moreover, hirudin-loaded materials showed an accelerated recovery in coordinated stepping and increased oligodendrocyte densities. Together, these data demonstrate that controlled delivery of hirudin accelerates functional recovery from a demyelination lesion in the spinal cord. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The suppression of cell apoptosis using a biodegradable scaffold to replace the missing or altered extracellular matrix (ECM) could increase the survival of transplanted cells and thus increase the effectiveness of cell therapy. Methods. We studied the best conditions for the proliferation and differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) when cultured on different biologic scaffolds derived from fibrin and blood plasma, and analyzed the best concentrations of fibrinogen, thrombin and calcium chloride for favoring cell survival. The induction of neural differentiation of hBMSC was done by adding to these scaffolds different growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and retinoic acid (RA), at concentrations of 100 ng/mL (NGF and BDNF) and 1 mu/mL (RA), over 7 days. Results. Although both types of scaffold allowed survival and neural differentiation of hBMSC, the results showed a clear superiority of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) scaffolds, mainly after BDNF administration, allowing most of the hBMSC to survive and differentiate into a neural phenotype. Conclusions. Given that clinical trials for spinal cord injury using hBMSC are starting, these findings may have important clinical applications."

Rats (n = 20) received complete transections at thoracic level 3 (T3) and 2 weeks later received NSC transplants in a fibrin matrix with a growth factor cocktail using 2 different transplantation methods (with and without removal of scar tissue). Control rats (n = 9) received transections only. Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed with the BBB scale. Nine weeks post injury, reticulospinal tract axons were traced in 6 rats by injecting BDA into the reticular formation. Transplants grew to fill the lesion cavity in most rats although grafts made with scar tissue removal had large central cavities. Grafts blended extensively with host tissue obliterating the astroglial boundary at the cut ends, but in most cases there was a well-defined partition within the graft that separated rostral and caudal parts of the graft. In some cases, the partition contained non-neuronal scar tissue. There was extensive outgrowth of GFP labeled axons from the graft, but there was minimal ingrowth of host axons into the graft revealed by tract tracing and immunocytochemistry for 5HT. There were no statistically significant differences between transplant and control groups in the degree of locomotor recovery. Our results confirm the previous report that NSC transplants can fill lesion cavities and robustly extend axons, but reveal that most grafts do not create a continuous bridge of neural tissue between rostral and caudal segments.

Here, we have analyzed the expression of RhoA(+) and RhoB(+) following spinal cord injury in order to assess whether Rho is a possible target for late pharmacological intervention. In control spinal cords, RhoA(+) cells were almost absent, whereas RhoB was localized to some ependymal cells, a few microglia, and some dissociated neurons. In injured spinal cords, RhoA(+) and RhoB(+) cells accumulated at perilesional areas and in the developing necrotic core early after injury at day 1. After reaching their maximum levels (RhoA(+) at day 3; RhoB(+) at day 1), RhoA(+) and RhoB(+) cell numbers remained significantly elevated until day 28. In areas remote from the lesion (>= 0.75 mm), a more discrete accumulation of RhoA(+) and RhoB(+) cells was observed, primarily in areas of ongoing Wallerian degeneration. RhoA(+) and RhoB(+) were predominantly expressed by polymorphonuclear granulocytes, ED1(+) microglia/macrophages, oligodendrocytes, some neurons, and swollen axons/neurites. Furthermore, expression was located to lesional, reactive astrocytes and fibroblastoid cells confined to areas of scar formation. Our experiments have determined that most RhoA(+) and RhoB(+) cells (>70%) are of mononuclear origin. The persistent presence of lesional RhoA(+) and RhoB axon/neurite fibers over a period of 4 weeks after injury suggests that Rho inhibition is a putative therapeutic concept also for delayed intervention after SCI."

The central mechanisms that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain include increased neuronal excitability, possibly a consequence of decreased availability of spinal GABA. GABA availability is regulated by the presence of the GABA-transporters (GATs). This study investigates the dorsal horn expression of the transporter GAT-1 and its functional involvement towards pain behaviour in the CCI model. Male Lewis rats (total n = 37) were subjected to CCI or to a sham procedure. A sub-group of animals was treated with the GAT-1 antagonist NO-711. Behavioural testing was performed pre-surgery and at 7 days post-surgery. Testing included evaluation of mechanical allodynia using Von Frey filaments, thermal allodynia with a hot-plate test and observational testing of spontaneous pain behaviour. Subsequently, spinal protein expression of GAT-1 was assessed by Western blotting. Animals were sacrificed 7 days following surgery. CCI markedly increased mechanical and thermal allodynia and spontaneous pain behaviour after 7 days, while the sham procedure did not. GAT-1 was increased in spinal cord homogenates compared contralateral to the ligation side after 7 days. NO-711 treatment significantly reduced all tested pain behaviour. These data provide evidence for possible functional involvement of GAT-1 in the development of experimental neuropathic pain. The latter can be derived from observed analgesic effects of early treatment with NO-711, a selective GAT-I inhibitor. The obtained insights support the clinical employment of GAT-1 inhibitors to treat neuropathic pain. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

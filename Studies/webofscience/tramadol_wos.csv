Accidents involving this porcupine and dogs have become usual in some cities of Brazil. Dog bites may eventually result in spinal injuries. When there is clinical evidence of spinal cord injury, a myelography under general anesthesia may be required to allow identification of the exact location of the injury. To the authors' knowledge, there is only one case report about anesthesia in Sphiggurus villosus where dissociative anesthesia was employed. This paper describes one case report of inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane in a Sphiggurus villosus undergoing myelography."

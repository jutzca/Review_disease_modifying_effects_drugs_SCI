In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure."

Eight derivatives were tested in vitro, using a double sucrose gap chamber, for the ability to restore conduction in isolated, injured guinea pig spinal cord. The methyl, ethyl and t-butyl carbamates of 4-aminopyridine induced an increase in the post injury compound action potential. The methyl and ethyl carbamates were further tested in an in vivo model of spinal cord injury. These results represent the first time that 4-aminopyridine has been derivatized without losing its ability to restore function in injured spinal cord tissue. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Animal lacking Crtl1 in the CNS lacks normal PNNs. PNNs are implicated in the control of neuronal plasticity, and interventions to modulate PNN formation will be useful for manipulating plasticity. We have developed an in vitro model which demonstrates how the structural components of PNNs trigger their formation, using human embryonic kidney cells, which do not normally produce a pericellular matrix. Expression of HAS3 leads to the production of a diffuse matrix. It was converted into a compact PNN-like structure when the cells also expressed Crtl1 and aggrecan. This matrix was stained by Wisteria floribunda, contained Crtl1 and aggrecan, and like PNNs, could only be solubilized in 6 M urea. In the absence of hyaluronan produced by HAS3, aggrecan and Crtl1 dissipated into the medium, but when the cells were transfected to produce a hyaluronan matrix, Crtl1 and aggrecan were incorporated into it. Cells lacking any one of these molecules showed impaired integrity of the PNNs. Cells expressing HAS3 and Crtl1 were able to incorporate exogenous aggrecan into their pericellular matrix."

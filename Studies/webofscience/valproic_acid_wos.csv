However, the effects of valproic acid-labeled chitosan nanoparticles (VA-CN) on endogenous spinal cord neural stem cells (NSCs) following SCI and the underlying mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. In this study, the VA-CN was constructed and the effects of VA-CN on NSCs were assessed in a rat model of SCI. We found VA-CN treatment promoted recovery of the tissue and locomotive function following SCI. Moreover, administration of VA-CN significantly enhanced neural stem cell proliferation and the expression levels of neurotrophic factors following SCI. Furthermore, administration of VA-CN led to a decrease in the number of microglia following SCI. In addition, VA-CN treatment significantly increased the Tuj 1- positive cells in the spinal cord of the SCI rats, suggesting that VA-CN could enhance the differentiation of NSCs following SCI. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that VA-CN could improve the functional and histological recovery through promoting the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs following SCI, which would provide a newly potential therapeutic manner for the treatment of SCI."

We hypothesized that HDAC8 inhibition improves functional recovery after SCI by reducing pro-inflammatory classically activated M phi. Specific HDAC8 inhibition with PCI-34051 reduced the numbers of perilesional M phi as measured by histological analyses, but did not improve functional recovery (Basso Mouse Scale). We could not reproduce the published improvement of functional recovery described in contusion SCI models using VPA in our T-cut hemisection SCI model. The presence of spared fibers might be the underlying reason for the conflicting data in different SCI models."

SCI contributes to the high disability rate. Presently, evidences detailing the precise pathological mechanisms in SCI are limited, compounding to the unavailability of an effective treatment method. Surgery, though not a complete curative method, is useful in managing some of the associated symptoms of secondary SCI. Autophagy and inflammation are contributive factors to both exacerbation and improvement of SCI. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a key player in the regulation of inflammatory response and autophagy. Valproic acid (VPA), a clinically used antiepileptic drug, has been suggested to improve neurological conditions, including SCI. This report reviewed the correlation between mTOR and autophagy, as well as autophagy's role and the therapeutic effects of VPA in SCI. VPA regulates autophagy by potentially inhibiting mTORC1, a complex of mTOR, while also hindering inflammatory response. Conclusively, an effective treatment for SCI could lie in the timely regulation of mTOR signaling pathway, and VPA could be the potential drug that improves SCI owing to its propensity to regulate the mTOR signaling pathway."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic injury resulting in loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function distal from the level of injury. An appropriate combination of biomaterials and bioactive substances is currently thought to be a promising approach to treat this condition. Systemic administration of valproic acid (VPA) has been previously shown to promote functional recovery in animal models of SCI. In this study, VPA was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microfibers by the coaxial electrospinning technique. Fibers showed continuous and cylindrical morphology, randomly oriented fibers, and compatible morphological and mechanical characteristics for application in SCI. Drug-release analysis indicated a rapid release of VPA during the first day of the in vitro test. The coaxial fibers containing VPA supported adhesion, viability, and proliferation of PC12 cells. In addition, the VPA/PLGA microfibers induced the reduction of PC12 cell viability, as has already been described in the literature. The biomaterials were implanted in rats after SCI. The groups that received the implants did not show increased functional recovery or tissue regeneration compared to the control. These results indicated the cytocompatibility of the VPA/PLGA core-shell microfibers and that it may be a promising approach to treat SCI when combined with other strategies."

Histone acetylation is involved in the control of the transcription of plasticity and regeneration-associated genes. The intrinsic axon growth capacity in the CNS is negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten). Inhibition of Pten is an effective method to stimulate axon growth following an injury to the optic nerve, corticospinal tract (CST), and rubrospinal tract (RST). Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the deletion of Pten in aged animals diminishes the regenerative capacity in rubrospinal neurons. We hypothesize that changes in the chromatin structure might contribute to this age-associated decline. Here, we assessed whether Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor, reverses the decline in regeneration in aged Pten(f/f) mice. We demonstrate that HDAC inhibition induces changes in the expression of GAP43 in both young and aged Pten(f/f) mice. The regenerative capacity of the RST did not improve significantly in young mice, neither their motor function on the horizontal ladder or cylinder test after TSA treatment for 7 days. Interestingly, TSA treatment in the aged mice worsened their motor function deficits, suggesting that the systemic treatment with TSA might have an overall adverse effect on motor recovery after SCI in aged animals.

We evaluated the effects of chronic hyperglycemia before SCI on inflammatory markers and functional recovery after SCI in human patients and a rat model. In the human study, multivariate logistical regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, reflecting average plasma glucose concentration over a 3 month period, at admission were a significant risk factor for poor functional recovery. Moreover, patients with chronic hyperglycemia (HbA1c >= 6.5%) had high concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-8) of cerebrospinal fluid after SCI. Consistent with patient findings, chronic hyperglycemia before SCI in rats was associated with increased inflammatory responses and oxygen-free radicals in the spinal cord and blood, thus resulting in poor functional recovery and histological outcomes. Tight glucose control before SCI decreased the harmful effects of hyperglycemia after SCI in both human and rat studies. Our findings suggest that chronic hyperglycemia before SCI may be a significant prognostic factor with a negative impact on functional and histological outcomes, highlighting the importance of tight glucose control before SCI."

The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort.ResultsOf the cohort (n=570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p=0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p=0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p=0.82 in propensity-matched cohort).ConclusionNon-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes."

Following facial nerve injury, all rats in group VPA showed a better functional recovery, which was significant at the given time, compared with group NS. The Nissl staining results demonstrated that the number of FMNs survival in group VPA was higher than that in group normal saline (NS). TUNEL staining showed that axonal injury of facial nerve could lead to neuronal apoptosis of FMNs. But treatment of VPA significantly reduced cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of Bax protein and increased neuronal survival by upregulating the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression in injured FM Ns compared with group NS.

We found that Jmjd3 up-regulation, in cooperation with NF-kappa B, after SCI is required for Mmp-3 and Mmp-9 gene expressions in injured vascular endothelial cells. In addition, Jmjd3 mRNA depletion inhibited Mmp-3 and Mmp-9 gene expressions and significantly attenuated BSCB permeability and the loss of tight junction proteins. These events further led to improved functional recovery, along with decreased hemorrhage, blood cell infiltration, inflammation, and cell death of neurons and oligodendrocytes after SCI. Thus, our findings suggest that Jmjd3 regulation may serve as a potential therapeutic intervention for preserving BSCB integrity following SCI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

It has recently been demonstrated that VPA could promote neurite outgrowth, activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, and increase B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2)and growth cone-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) levels in spinal cord. We hypothesized that VPA could enhance axonal regeneration in the rat. In the present research, we demonstrate the effect of VPA on peripheral nerve regeneration and recovery of motor function through a silicon tube implanted with VPA. The left sciatic nerves were exposed through dorsal-splitting incisions, and 8-mm nerve sections were excised at the middle of the thigh. Then, a 1.0-cm-long silicone tube (internal diameter, 1.0 mm, exterior diameter, 2.0 mm) was used to bridge the nerve deficit, anchored to the proximal and distal terminals of the excised deficit of sciatic nerves with 9-0 nylon epineural suture. Sterile petroleum jelly was used to seal the ends of the tubes to avoid leakage. The rats in the VPA group and control group were locally delivered 10 mu L VPA injection (400 mg/5 mL) and normal saline, respectively, after the operation. The sciatic nerve index (SFI) was observed in each animal at 2-week intervals and electrophysiology was studied at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. Histological and morphometrical analyses were performed at the end of the,experiment (12 weeks after the operation). Using the digital image-analysis system, the thickness of the myelin sheath was measured, and total numbers of regenerated axons were counted. There was a significant difference in SFI, electrophysiological index (motor-nerve conduct velocity, amplitude of activity potential), and morphometrical results (regenerated axon number and thickness of myelin sheath) in nerve regeneration between the VPA group and controls (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that VPA is able to enhance sciatic nerve regeneration in rats, suggesting the potential clinical application of VPA for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury in humans."

To maximize the regenerative effect of the derived neurons and to minimize the side effects of the derived astrocytes, it is necessary to regulate the fate determination of NSCs to produce more neurons and fewer astrocytes. Both valproic acid (VPA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), two clinically established drugs, induce neuronal differentiation and facilitate neurite outgrowth at the expense of astrocytic differentiation in NSCs. However, the time-dependent activities and the long-term treatment effects of these drugs have not been explored in NSCs. More importantly, the efficacies of VPA and ATRA in neuronal promotion and astrocytic suppression remain unclear. In this study, we compare the time-dependent characteristics of VPA and ATRA in NSC differentiation and neurite outgrowth in vitro and, for the first time, demonstrate the improved efficacy of their combined application in neuronal induction and astrocrtic suppression. These significant effects are closely coupled to the altered expression of a neurogenic transcription factor, a Wnt signaling component, a cell cycle regulator and a neural growth factor, indicating an underlying cross-talk between the mechanisms of action of ATRA and VPA. These findings indicate that a novel strategy combining these two therapeutic drugs may improve the restorative effect of NSC transplantation by altering the expression of their interconnected targets for fate determination.

Objective: Here, we report the effects of valproic acid (VPA) on focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (fEAE). Methods: fEAE was induced in Wistar rats by immunizing the animals with guinea pig spinal cord homogenate emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and with pertussis toxin (PT) injection into the spinal cord at the level of 18 vertebra on day 18 after immunization. VPA 300 mg/kg was applied for 4 days after or 8 days before PT administration. Behavioral evaluation, histological assessment and immunohistofluorescence assays were used to evaluate the outcomes. Results: VPA administration had no effect on the development of symptoms, but after discontinuing VPA, animals showed faster recovery. Eight days of pretreatment with VPA accelerated the recovery phase of EAE and increased the number of remyelinated axons in the lesion area. VPA pretreatment also increased the recruitment of neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte precursors within the lesion. Conclusions: Results suggest VPA as a potential therapy for remyelinating the lesions in MS and for faster recovery from disease relapses.

In this study, using a minipump-based infusion system, we found that intraspinal infusion with VPA for 3 days into injured spinal cord significantly improved hindlimb locomotion of rats with severe SCI induced by a 10-g NYU impactor dropping from the height of 50 mm onto the spinal T9/10 segment. The neuronal fibers in the injured spinal cord tissues were significantly preserved in VPA-treated rats compared with those observed in vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, the accumulation of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the injured spinal cord was attenuated in the animal group receiving VPA infusion. VPA also significantly reduced P2X4R expression post-SCI. Furthermore, in vitro study indicated that VPA, but not the other HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA), caused downregulation of P2X4R in microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-triggered signaling was involved in the effect of VPA on the inhibition of P2X4R gene expression. In addition to the findings from others, our results also provide important evidence to show the inhibitory effect of VPA on P2X4R expression in activated microglia, which may contribute to reduction of SCI-induced gliosis and subsequently preservation of spinal cord tissues.

After SCI, rats were immediately injected with VPA (300 mg/kg) subcutaneously and further injected every 12 h for an indicated time period. Motor neuron cell death at an early time after SCI was significantly attenuated by VPA treatment. Superoxide anion (O-2(-)) production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression linked to oxidative stress was increased after injury, which was inhibited by VPA. In addition, VPA inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, which was activated and peaked at an early time after SCI. Furthermore, JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation were inhibited by a broad-spectrum reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, Mn (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), indicating that ROS including O-2(-) increased after SCI probably contribute to JNK activation. VPA also inhibited cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation, which was significantly inhibited by SP600125, a JNK inhibitor. The levels of phosphorylated Bim and Mcl-1, which are known as downstream targets of JNK, were significantly reduced by SP600125. On the other hand, VPA treatment inhibited ER stress-induced caspase-12 activation, which is activated in motor neurons after SCI.

Abstract The disruption of bloodspinal cord barrier (BSCB) after spinal cord injury (SCI) elicits an intensive local inflammation by the infiltration of blood cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, leading to cell death and permanent neurological disability. SCI activates matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), which is known to induce BSCB disruption. Here, we examined whether valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, would attenuate BSCB disruption by inhibiting MMP-9 activity, leading to improvement of functional outcome after SCI. After moderate spinal cord contusion injury at T9, VPA (300 mg/kg) were immediately injected subcutaneously and further injected every 12 h for 5 days. Our data show that VPA inhibited MMP-9 activity after injury, and attenuated BSCB permeability and degradation of tight junction molecules such as occludin and ZO-1. In addition, VPA reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-a. Furthermore, VPA increased the levels of acetylated histone 3, pAkt, and heat-shock protein 27 and 70, which have anti-apoptotic functions after SCI. Finally, VPA inhibited apoptotic cell death and caspase 3 activation, reduced the lesion volume and improved functional recovery after injury. Thus, our results demonstrated that VPA improves functional recovery by attenuating BSCB disruption via inhibition of MMP-9 activity after SCI."

Here, using a mouse model of SCI, we have shown that transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) together with administration of valproic acid (VPA), a known antiepileptic and histone deacetylase inhibitor, dramatically enhanced the restoration of hind limb function. VPA treatment promoted the differentiation of transplanted NSCs into neurons rather than glial cells. Transsynaptic anterograde corticospinal tract tracing revealed that transplant-derived neurons reconstructed broken neuronal circuits, and electron microscopic analysis revealed that the transplant-derived neurons both received and sent synaptic connections to endogenous neurons. Ablation of the transplanted cells abolished the recovery of hind limb motor function, confirming that NSC transplantation directly contributed to restored motor function. These findings raise the possibility that epigenetic status in transplanted NSCs can be manipulated to provide effective treatment for SCI."

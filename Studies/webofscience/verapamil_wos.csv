To identify pharmacological enhancers of axon regeneration, 960 compounds were screened for cortical neuron axonal regrowth using an in vitro cortical scrape assay. Diltiazem, verapamil, and bromopride were discovered to facilitate axon regeneration in rat cortical cultures, in the presence of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Diltiazem, an L-type calcium channel blocker (L-CCB), also promotes axon outgrowth in adult primary mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and induced human sensory (iSensory) neurons."

We hypothesize that the hypoxia accompanying these events could damage the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and so cause testicular dysfunction, a possible cause of impotence. We examined the effect of cardiac arrest in mice on testis weight and various aspects of BTB function. Testis weight was decreased by about 24% 12 hours after cardiac arrest but had recovered fully by day 7. The testis/serum ratio for albumin was increased 12 hours after arrest, showing a disruption in the vascular BTB with recovery by 24 hours. The testis/serum ratio for sucrose was not consistently elevated, showing that the Sertoli cell BTB remained intact. The testis/serum ratio for verapamil was increased on day 3 of cardiac arrest, suggesting impaired function of the BTB's p-glycoprotein efflux transporter. Transporters for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were not affected by cardiac arrest. These results show that cardiac arrest affects testis weight and some aspects of BTB function. Such changes might have long-term effects on testicular function."

This Na+ leak likely occurs via incompletely inactivated voltage-gated Na+ channels. This study reports that clinically used antiarrhythmic compounds, likely by virtue of their Na+ channel-blocking properties, significantly protect CNS white matter from anoxia at concentrations that cause little suppression of the preanoxic response. Rat optic nerves were pretreated with various agents for 60 min, then subjected to 60 min of anoxia in vitro. Functional recovery was measured electrophysiologically as the area under the compound action potential (CAP). Without drug, the CAP areas recovered to a mean of 32 +/- 12% of control after 1 h of reoxygenation. Recoveries using prajmaline 10 mu M were 82 +/- 15% (p < 0.0001), and using tocainide 1 mM, 78 +/- 8% (p < 0.0001), with little suppression (less than or equal to 10%) of the preanoxic response. Ajmaline (10-100 mu M), disopyramide (10-300 mu M) and bupivacaine (10-100 mu M) were somewhat less effective, whereas verapamil produced 52 +/- 11% recovery before reduction of the preanoxic CAP was observed at 30 mu M. Procainamide (100-300 mu M) was ineffective. These results suggest that Na+ channel blockers, including commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, may be effective in protecting central white matter, which is a target for anoxic/ischemic injury in diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury."

The transmembrane Ca2+ transporting processes are considered likely candidates for the ischemia-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+. In the present paper we have monitored metabolism in the cerebral cortex in vitro before, during and after aglycaemic hypoxia using P-31 and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. We used the recovery of cellular metabolites phosphocreatine, ATP, lactate, glutamate and N-acetyl aspartate determined by NMR as an indicator of cell damage caused by hypoxia. Phosphocreatine concentration recovered to only -58% of its control level following 15 min of aglycaemic hypoxia in the presence of 1.2 mM Ca2+. The ratios of phosphocreatine/ATP, lactate/N-acetyl aspartate and glutamate/N-acetyl aspartate did not differ at 1 h of recovery from the prehypoxia levels showing that the hypoxia resistant cells were metabolically viable. In the absence of external Ca2+, phosphocreatine recovery improved to approximately 80%. Ten mM Mg2+ or 25 muM diltiazem in the presence of 1.2 mM Ca2+ improved recovery of phosphocreatine to approximately 85%. Two other antagonists of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, verapamil and nifedipine, did not protect the cerebral cortex from hypoxic damage. N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 muM) applied during hypoxia with 1.2 mM Ca2+ did not augment the loss of phosphocreatine indicating that the cellular damage was not potentiated by the drug, even when 30 mM K+ was present. The presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate did not weaken the protective effect of diltiazem. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate or non-N-methyl-D-aspartate channels did not alleviate cellular damage caused by hypoxic insult. The present results suggest that the immediate, Ca2+-mediated neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex may be mediated by Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels."

The transected and treated nerve which received a d.c. electrical stimulator (0.6-mu-A) was compared with untreated transected and crushed nerves. At one week postoperative, the probe was used to measure in vivo the current density along the nerve length. All nerves studied had a proximal peak at the lesion site and a second peak at varying distal locations: crushed/untreated (13.3 mm), transected/untreated (9.7 mm) and transected/treated (16.3 mm). A significant difference (69%) between the distal peak distances in the two transection groups suggests that the electrical treatment enhanced the progress of nerve regeneration. There were no significant differences between the mean peak amplitudes (1.6-2.2-mu-A/cm2). Applied verapamil reduced the peaks, suggesting they are associated in part with a calcium-dependent current. Electron microscopy at selected nerve regions indicated that the peaks correspond to regenerating axonal growth cones."

To examine the relevance of these findings to neurotrauma, we conducted electrophysiological studies with inorganic Ca2+ channels blockers and L- and N-subtype-specific calcium channel antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury. Confocal immunohistochemistry was used to examine for localization of L- and N-type calcium channels in spinal cord white matter tracts. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber and injured with a modified clip (2 g closing force) for 15 s. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential at two points with glass microelectrodes. The compound action potential decreased to 71.4 +/- 2.0% of control (P < 0.05) after spinal cord injury. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ promoted significantly greater recovery of compound action potential amplitude (86.3 +/- 7.6% of control; P < 0.05) after injury. Partial blockade of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with cobalt (20 mu M) or cadmium (200 mu M) conferred improvement in compound action potential amplitude. Application of the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers diltiazem (50 mu M) or verapamil (90 mu M), and the N-type antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 mu M), significantly enhanced the recovery of compound action potential amplitude postinjury. Go-application of the L-type antagonist diltiazem with the N-type blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA showed significantly greater (P < 0.05) improvement in compound action potential amplitude than application of either drug alone. Confocal immunohistochemistry with double labelling for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GalC and NF200 demonstrated L- and N-type Ca2+ channels on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not axons, in spinal cord white matter."

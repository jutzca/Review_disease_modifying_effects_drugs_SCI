In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure."

Previously, we showed that intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the albumin-oleic acid (A-OA) complex in rats with SCI produced partial improvement of these symptoms and that oral 2-hydroxyoleic acid (HOA, a non-hydrolyzable OA analogue), was efficacious in the modulation and treatment of nociception and pain-related anxiety, respectively. Here we observed that intrathecal treatment with the complex albumin-HOA (A-HOA) every 3 days following T9 spinal contusion injury improved locomotor function assessed with the Rotarod and inhibited TA noxious reflex activity in Wistar rats. To investigate the mechanism of action of A-HOA, microarray analysis was carried out in the spinal cord lesion area. Representative genes involved in pain and neuroregeneration were selected to validate the changes observed in the microarray analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Comparison of the expression between healthy rats, SCI rats, and SCI treated with A-HOA rats revealed relevant changes in the expression of genes associated with neuronal morphogenesis and growth, neuronal survival, pain and inflammation. Thus, treatment with A-HOA not only induced a significant overexpression of growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10), tenascin C (TNC), aspirin (ASPN) and sushi-repeat-containing X-linked 2 (SRPX2), but also a significant reduction in the expression of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and phospholipases A1 and A2 (PLA1/2). Currently, SCI has very important unmet clinical needs. A-HOA down-regulated genes involved with inflammation and upregulated genes involved in neuronal growth, and may serve to promote recovery of function after experimental SCI."

Medicine has explored therapeutic options for patients with TSCI with the aim to improve their quality of life. One alternative has been the development of biomaterials that offer neuroprotection or neuroregeneration of damaged nerve tissue. The microinjection of iodine-doped polypyrrole particles synthesised by plasma (PPPy/I) has shown neuroprotective effects that favour motor function recovery in experimental animals with TSCI. However, their ability to migrate into the tissue has led to the need to test a suspension vehicle that enables the concentration of particles at the site of injury. To achieve this, two biomaterials of PPPy/I (P1 and P2) were studied. The superficial physicochemical characterisation of the polymers was performed by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle. The rheological performance under oscillatory shear rate of suspensions containing both polymers alone and in combination with bovine serum albumin was also studied. In vivo tests were performed on animals with and without TSCI that were microinjected with particles of P1 or P2 in suspension using a solution of rat serum albumin. Exposure to the protein solutions generates a protein multilayer on the surface of the biomaterials that can drastically change the behaviour of both P1 and P2, which led to severe repercussions in the in vivo assays. The results showed that surface chemistry plays an important role in the performance and that it is possible to treat TSCI with these materials."

Pressure ulcers are difficult to heal in this population requiring at least six months of bed rest. Surgical treatment (grafting) is the fastest recovery time, but it still requires six weeks of bed rest plus significant additional costs and a high recurrence rate. A significant clinical benefit would be obtained by speeding the healing rate of a non-surgical treatment to close to that of surgical treatment (approximately doubling of healing rate). Current non-surgical treatment is mostly inactive wound coverings. The goal of this project was to look at the feasibility of doubling the healing rate of a full-thickness defect using combinations of three treatments, for the first time, each shown to increase healing rate: application of transforming growth factor-(3) (TGF-(3)), an albumin based scaffold, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). At one week following surgery, the combined treatment showed the greatest increase in healing rate, particularly for the epithelialization rate. Although the target level of a 100% increase in healing rate over the control was not quite achieved, it is anticipated that the goal would be met with further optimization of the treatment."

We examined the effect of cardiac arrest in mice on testis weight and various aspects of BTB function. Testis weight was decreased by about 24% 12 hours after cardiac arrest but had recovered fully by day 7. The testis/serum ratio for albumin was increased 12 hours after arrest, showing a disruption in the vascular BTB with recovery by 24 hours. The testis/serum ratio for sucrose was not consistently elevated, showing that the Sertoli cell BTB remained intact. The testis/serum ratio for verapamil was increased on day 3 of cardiac arrest, suggesting impaired function of the BTB's p-glycoprotein efflux transporter. Transporters for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were not affected by cardiac arrest. These results show that cardiac arrest affects testis weight and some aspects of BTB function. Such changes might have long-term effects on testicular function."

Albumin-based nanoparticles, which can encapsulate therapeutic drugs and release cargo in a controlled pattern, show high biocompatibility and low toxicity. The Nogo protein, expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes, can inhibit axonal growth by binding with the axonal Nogo receptor (NgR). Peptide NEP1-40, an NgR antagonist, can bind specifically to Nogo, significantly improving functional recovery and axon growth in the corticospinal tract. Therefore, we hypothesized that delivering MP within nanoparticles decorated with NEP1-40 could avoid the disadvantages of free MP and enhance its therapeutic efficacy against SCI.ResultsWe used human serum albumin to prepare MP-loaded NPs (MP-NPs), to whose surface we conjugated NEP1-40 to form NEP1-40-MP-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated successful formation of nanoparticles. NEP1-40-MP-NPs were taken up significantly better than MP-NPs by the Nogo-positive cell line RSC-96 and were associated with significantly higher Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores in rats recovering from SCI. Micro-computed tomography assay showed that NEP1-40-MP-NPs mitigated SCI-associated loss of bone mineral density and accelerated spinal cord repair.ConclusionsNEP(1-40)-MP-NPs can enhance the therapeutic effects of MP against SCI. This novel platform may also be useful for delivering other types of drugs."

There is a need to identify reliable biomarkers of spinal cord injury recovery for clinical practice and clinical trials. Objective. Our objective was to correlate serum albumin levels with spinal cord injury neurological outcomes. Methods. We performed a secondary analysis of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (n = 591) participating in the Sygen clinical trial. Serum albumin concentrations were obtained as part of routine blood chemistry analysis, at trial entry (24-72 hours), 1, 2, and 4 weeks after injury. The primary outcomes were marked recovery and lower extremity motor scores, derived from the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic and linear regression to adjust for potential confounders. Results. Serum albumin was significantly associated with spinal cord injury neurological outcomes. Higher serum albumin concentrations at 1, 2, and 4 weeks were associated with higher 52-week lower extremity motor score. Similarly, the odds of achieving marked neurological recovery was greater for individuals with higher serum albumin concentrations. The association between serum albumin concentrations and neurological outcomes was independent of initial injury severity, treatment with GM-1, and polytrauma. Conclusions. In spinal cord injury, serum albumin is an independent marker of long-term neurological outcomes. Serum albumin could serve as a feasible biomarker for prognosis at the time of injury and stratification in clinical trials."

Herein, a MnO2 nanoparticle (NP)-dotted hydrogel is prepared through dispersion of MnO2 NPs in a PPFLMLLKGSTR peptide modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel. The peptide -modified hydrogel enables the adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and nerve tissue bridging. The MnO2 NPs alleviate the oxidative environment, thereby effectively improving the viability of MSCs. Transplantation of MSCs in the multifunctional gel generates a significant motor function restoration on a long-span rat spinal cord transection model and induces an in vivo integration as well as neural differentiation of the implanted MSCs, leading to a highly efficient regeneration of central nervous spinal cord tissue. Therefore, the MnO2 NP-dotted hydrogel represents a promising strategy for stem-cell-based therapies of central nervous system diseases through the comprehensive regulation of pathological microenvironment complications."

We have studied the endogenous expression of the transcription factors PPAR alpha and LXR beta in the chronic stage after SCI in rats. The immunohistochemical investigation revealed a long lasting increase in the level of PPAR alpha in white matter in the vicinity of the lesion site. The source of this signal was identified in a subpopulation of astrocytes outside of the glial scar area. Intrathecal injections of oleic acid/albumin reduced the lesion-induced PPAR alpha immunoreactivity. In addition, ependymal cells displayed a prominent PPAR alpha signal in the non-injured spinal cord, and continued to express the receptor as they proliferated and migrated within the damaged tissue. The nuclear receptor LXR beta was detected at similar levels after SCI as in sham operated animals. We found high levels of immunoreactivity in the gray matter, while in the white matter it was present in subpopulations of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Macrophages that had accumulated within the center of the lesion contained LXR beta in their cell nuclei. Possible endogenous functions of PPAR alpha and LXR beta after SCI are discussed, specifically the control of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and the regulation of inflammatory reactions.

Rats treated with scaffold plus cells showed locomotor skills at several time points from 45 days post-injury that were improved over those recorded in control injured, untreated animals. Astrocytic scars and tissue regeneration, identified using histological and immunohistochemical techniques, revealed that although the scaffold itself appeared to play a significant role in reducing glial scar formation and filling of the lesion cavity with cells, the presence of ADSCs and OECs in the scaffold led to the appearance of cells expressing markers of neurons and axons at the injury site.

These observations suggest that non-peptide compounds with varying affinity to melanocortin receptors are able to influence the pathophysiology of SCI. Furthermore, compounds acting at melanocortin, MCR4 receptors are capable to induce neuroprotection in spinal cord following trauma."

Although the use of multiple agents is efficacious in animal models of peripheral nerve injury, translation to clinical applications remains wanting. Previous agents used in trials in humans either engendered severe side effects or were ineffective. Because the blood-central nervous system barrier exists in nerves as it does in the brain, limited drug delivery poses a problem for translation of basic science advances into clinical applications. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising adjunct to current therapies for peripheral nerve injury. In the present study the authors assessed the capacity of convection to ferry macromolecules across sites of nerve injury in rat and primate models, examined the functional effects of convection on the intact nerve, and investigated the possibility of delivering a macromolecule to the spinal cord via retrograde convection from a peripherally introduced catheter."

To achieve this sustained release, anti-NogoA is typically delivered by osmotic minipumps; however, external minipumps are susceptible to infection. To address this issue, we developed a drug delivery system that consists of anti-NogoA-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles dispersed in a hydrogel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (composite HAMC). To optimize in vitro release, we screened formulations for improved anti-NogoA bioactivity and sustained release based on combinations of co-encapsulated trehalose, hyaluronan, MgCO3, and CaCO3. Co-encapsulated MgCO3 and CaCO3 slowed the rate of anti-NogoA release and did not influence anti-NogoA bioactivity. Co-encapsulated trehalose significantly improved anti-NogoA bioactivity at early release time points by stabilizing the protein during lyophilization. Co-encapsulated trehalose with hyaluronan improved bioactivity up to 28d and dramatically increased the rate and duration of sustained delivery. The sustained release of bioactive anti-NogoA from composite HAMC is a compelling formulation for in vivo evaluation in a model of spinal cord injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We also compared the capacity of P 188 to that of PEG to suppress aggregation of carboxypeptidase A denatured in the presence of trifluoroethanol and to facilitate recovery of catalytic activity. In contrast to the multi-block copolymers, PEG had no effect in inhibiting aggregation of HEWL or of carboxypeptidase A with the recovery of catalytic activity. At very high polymer:protein ratios (>= 10: 1), PEG increased aggregation of heat-denatured HEWL and BSA, consistent with its known properties to promote macromolecular crowding and crystallization of proteins. At a polymer:protein ratio of 2: 1, the tetra-block copolymer T1107 was the most effective of the three surfactant copolymers, completely suppressing aggregation of heat-denatured HEWL. At a T1107:BSA ratio of 10: 1, the poloxamer suppressed aggregation of heat-denatured BSA by 50% compared to that observed in the absence of the polymer. We showed that the extent of suppression of aggregation of heat-denatured proteins by multi-block surfactant copolymers is dependent on the size of the protein and the copolymer: protein molar ratio. We also concluded that at least one of the tertiary nitrogens in the ethylene-1,2-diamine structural core of the T1107 copolymer is protonated, and that this electrostatic factor underlies its capacity to suppress aggregation of denatured proteins more effectively than nonionic, multi-block poloxamers. These results indicate that amphiphilic, surfactant, multi-block copolymers are efficient as additives to suppress aggregation and to facilitate refolding of denatured proteins in solution. Because of these properties, multi-block, surfactant copolymers are suitable for application to a variety of biotechnological and biomedical problems in which refolding of denatured or misfolded proteins and suppression of aggregation are important objectives.

This study tests the specific role of p55 and p75 receptors in mediating the transport of TNF-alpha across the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) after SCI by compression. Transcytosis of I'll-TNF-(x across a monolayer of the cerebral endothelial cells that compose the blood-brain barrier was significantly reduced in the absence of functional p55 and p75 receptors. At 3 d after SCI, double receptor knockout mice had a significantly reduced increase in TNF-a uptake from blood to injured lumbar spinal cord as compared with their inbred controls, despite the similar extent of BSCB disruption (measured by Tc-99m-albumin). The p75 single receptor knockout mice had a reduced increase in I-125-TNF-alpha uptake, whereas the p55 receptor knockout mice had no significant increase of I-125-TNF-cc uptake after SCI, suggesting that the p55 receptor plays a major role. Hence, the increased uptake of TNF-alpha 3 d after SCI is not explained by nonspecific barrier disruption but by receptor-mediated upregulation of transport. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis further showed that upregulation of TNF-alpha transport was related to increased expression of mRNA for p55 and p75 receptors. The increase of p55 receptor expression was more robust and seen between 12 h and 1 wk after SCI, whereas the increase of p75 receptor expression occurred later and involved fewer regions. Thus, the differential upregulation of p55 and p75 receptors indicates that permeation of TNF-alpha across the injured BSC remains a regulated process. Knowledge of receptor-mediated regulation could facilitate effective therapeutic manipulation of BSCB permeation of vascular cytokines important to CNS regeneration."

Although Alb can promote basic recovery of motor function after iSCI, the therapeutic effect of OA or Alb-OA on a known translational measure of SCI associated with symptoms of spasticity and change in nociception has not been studied. Following T9 spinal contusion injury in Wistar rats, intrathecal treatment with: i) Saline, ii) Alb (0.4 nanomoles), iii) OA (80 nanomoles), iv) Alb-Elaidic acid (0.4/80 nanomoles), or v) Alb-OA (0.4/80 nanomoles) were evaluated on basic motor function, temporal summation of noxious reflex activity, and with a new test of descending modulation of spinal activity below the SCI up to one month after injury. Albumin, OA and Alb-OA treatment inhibited nociceptive Tibialis Anterior (TA) reflex activity. Moreover Alb-OA synergistically promoted early recovery of locomotor activity to 50 +/- 10% of control and promoted de novo phasic descending inhibition of TA noxious reflex activity to 47 +/- 5% following non-invasive electrical conditioning stimulation applied above the iSCI. Spinal L4-L5 immunohistochemistry demonstrated a unique increase in serotonin fibre innervation up to 4.2 +/- 1.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.3 fold within the dorsal and ventral horn respectively with Alb-OA treatment when compared to uninjured tissue, in addition to a reduction in NR1 NMDA receptor phosphorylation and microglia reactivity. Early recovery of voluntary motor function accompanied with tonic and de novo phasic descending inhibition of nociceptive TA flexor reflex activity following Alb-OA treatment, mediated via known endogenous spinal mechanisms of action, suggests a clinical application of this novel neurotrophic factor for the treatment of paralysis, spasticity and pain."

Adhesion is a prerequisite for the harmful leukocyte actions. Rapid mediation of leukocyte adhesion and aggravation of reperfusion injury can occur through production of platelet-activating factor (PAF). The authors hypothesized that prevention of leukocyte adhesion during ischemia reperfusion would have beneficial effects and that these effects might be enhanced by a PAF antagonist. To test this hypothesis, rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to severe spinal cord ischemia (25 minutes) followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, at which time either vehicle, antibody against the CD11/CD18 (anti-CD) leukocyte adhesion molecule (1 mg/kg), or the anti-CD and PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (3 mg/kg), was administered intravenously and the animals were monitored for 6.5 hours. Using a score from 0 to 5, recovery of motor function was improved at 5.5 hours by the CD antibody (2.0 +/- 0.5 versus 0.4 +/- 0.2 in the six animals in the vehicle group, p < 0.05). No further improvement was induced by WEB 2086 in the six anti-CD treated animals (1.6 +/- 0.7). Spinal cord blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) at 6 hours was at the preischemic level in the control animals (-7% +/- 20%), but clearly increased in the anti-CD group (+73% +/- 29%, p < 0.5). The severity of blood-brain barrier damage in the spinal cord gray matter was decreased by the treatments. Extravasation of intravenously injected Evans blue albumin (EBA), measured by detection of EBA fluorescence, was reduced by approximately 50% in both treated groups (p < 0.05). The number of morphologically normal motor neurons in the lumbar anterior horns of the infarcted spinal cord showed protection in the seven animals in the anti-CD treated group at 6.5 hours: 12.7 +/- 1.7 versus 5.3 +/- 1.6 (vehicle), p < 0.05 without an additional effect by PAF antagonist 12.2 +/- 2.6 (anti-CD + WEB 2086).

(2) Do observed high interstitial concentrations or depletion of substances in the intracellular space by microdialysis affect release measurements upon spinal cord injury? Amino acid concentrations around microdialysis fibres in the spinal cord of rats were found to approach those in the circulation and to be much higher than interstitial concentrations previously estimated in the CNS. However, much lower concentrations of amino acids were derived in the hippocampus by analogous experiments. Considerable Evans Blue/albumin leaked from the circulation into the interstitial space in the spinal cord immediately after fibre insertion. However, this movement diminished considerably by 4 h later, demonstrating substantial resealing of the blood-brain barrier, at least to large molecules. There is either substantial damage-induced movement of amino acids from the circulation into the dialysis zone after insertion of a microdialysis probe, or there is much less impediment to movement of amino acids across the blood-brain barrier in the spinal cord than in the brain. At low flow rates through the fibre, adding concentrations of amino acids to the inside of the fibre equal to the concentrations around the fibre to prevent their depletion by removal through the microdialysis fibre did not affect increases in concentrations of amino acids in microdialysates following injury."

ECs at the BBB were studied by immunocytochemistry for any alteration in the endothelial barrier antigen (EBA), a molecular marker for the intact BBB. Immunocytochemistry showed rapid but mild opening of the BBB to endogenous albumin.

SCI produced stereotypical sensorimotor deficits resembling the classically described Brown-Sequard syndrome. Disruption of the BSCB was reflected by increased spinal cord uptake of radiolabeled albumin from blood; this was transient (immediately after SCI) and confined to the lumbar spinal cord. By contrast, specific increase in the entry of TNFalpha was detected in brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord at 1 week after SCI, in addition to its immediate and transient increase consistent with barrier disruption. Lack of a second peak of increase in the entry of IL1beta further supported the specificity of the TNFalpha response. Moreover, enhanced uptake of radiolabeled TNFalpha was suppressed by excess non-radiolabeled TNFalpha indicating competition of entry via the known transport system for TNFalpha. Therefore, upregulation of the transport system after SCI probably mediates the increased permeation of TNFalpha across the BSCB. Enhanced entry of TNFalpha at 1 week after SCI was concurrent with sensorimotor and gait improvement of the mouse. We conclude that SCI by lumbar hemisection activates the transport system for TNFalpha at the BBB and suggest that selective permeation of TNFalpha may facilitate functional recovery.

However, the biological significance of KS remains elusive. Here, we addressed the question of whether KS is involved in plasticity after spinal cord injury. Keratanase II (K-II) specifically degraded KS, i.e., not CS, in vivo. This enzyme digestion promoted the recovery of motor and sensory function after spinal cord injury in rats. Consistent with this, axonal regeneration/sprouting was enhanced in K-II-treated rats. K-II and the CS-degrading enzyme chondroitinase ABC exerted comparable effects in vivo and in vitro. However, these two enzymes worked neither additively nor synergistically. These data and further in vitro studies involving artificial proteoglycans (KS/CS-albumin) and heat-denatured or reduced/alkylated proteoglycans suggested that all three components of the proteoglycan moiety, i.e., the core protein, CS chains, and KS chains, were required for the inhibitory activity of proteoglycans.

The neurochemical findings measured by HPLC were compared with known outcome measures of this model. A laminectomy of vertebrae Th-7 and Th-8 was made and a microdialysis probe was inserted in one dorsal horn. Fluid samples were collected at intervals of 10 min. Dialysate lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratios increased in proportion to the severity of injury, suggesting a progressive derangement of energy metabolism. Mild trauma, with no neurologic deficits, did not induce any remarkable change of amino acids, but taurine values were temporarily slightly elevated. Moderate trauma, leading to transient paraparesis, resulted in a transient rise of glutamate and taurine. Severe trauma resulting in paraplegia of the hind limbs induced profound changes of extracellular amino acids. Glutamate and aspartate rose 5-6 times above basal level. There were marked elevations of taurine, glycine, arginine, alanine, asparagine, histidine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine after this degree of trauma. Glutamate, aspartate, and taurine returned to the basal level within 50 min, whereas most of the other amino acids remained elevated throughout the experiment. Thus, we found profound disturbances of extracellular amino acids and energy metabolites. The elevations of glutamate and aspartate correlated with previously recorded data on neurological outcome. The composition of the early extracellular edema showed marked temporal changes related to the severity of impact. Future studies regarding treatment of traumatic edema should focus on its chemical composition as well as its volume since such edema is not uniform in composition."

A continuous GDNF supply is believed to gain greater efficacy in the neural restoration of the injured spinal cord. Accordingly, nanovehicle formulation for their efficient delivery and sustained release in injured spinal cord was examined. We first used fluorescence-labeled bovine serum albumin (FBSA) loaded in biodegradable poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) for intraspinal administration after SCI and for in vitro study. Our results showed that the preservation of PLGA-FBSA was observed in the injured spinal cord at 24 h, and PLGA-FBSA nanoparticles were well absorbed by neurons and glia, indicating that PLGA as a considerable nanovehicle for the delivery of neuroprotective polypeptide into injured spinal cord. Furthermore, intraspinal injection of GDNF encapsulated in PLGA (PLGA-GDNF) nanoparticles into the injured spinal cord proximal to the lesion center had no effect on gliosis when compared to that observed in SCI rats receiving PLGA injection. However, local administration of PLGA-GDNF effectively preserved neuronal fibers and led to the hindlimb locomotor recovery in rats with SCI, providing a potential strategy for the use of PLGA-GDNF in the treatment of SCI (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the functions of apoE within the nervous system, we examined apoE knockout (KO) mice. Previously, we showed that apoE KO mice have a delayed response to noxious thermal stimuli associated with a loss and abnormal morphology of unmyelinated fibers in the sciatic nerve. From these data, we hypothesized that apoE KO mice could have an impaired blood-nerve barrier (BNB). In this report, we demonstrate functionally impaired blood-nerve and blood-brain barriers (BBB) in apoE KO mice using immunofluorescent detection of serum protein leakage into nervous tissue as a diagnostic for decreased BNB and BBB integrity. Extensive extravasation of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) is detected in the sciatic nerve, spinal cord, and cerebellum of apoE KO but not WT mice. In a subpopulation of apoE KO mice, IBG also extravasates into discrete cortical and subcortical locations, including hippocampus. Loss of BBB integrity was additionally confirmed by the ability of exogenously supplied Evens blue dye to penetrate the BBB and to colocalize with IgG immunoreactivity in CNS tissue. These observations support a role for apoE in maintaining the integrity of the BNB/BBB and suggest a novel relationship between apoE and neural injury. (C) 2001 Academic Press."

Adult rats were given a single dose of 0, 2, 8, 19.5, 22, 30 or 50 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 2 weeks after irradiation, the spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Radiation-induced apoptosis was assessed by morphology and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling combined with immunohistochemical markers for endothelial and glial cells. Image analysis was performed to determine endothelial cell and microvessel density using immunohistochemistry with endothelial markers, namely endothelial barrier antigen, glucose transporter isoform l., laminin and zonula occludens 1. Blood-spinal cord barrier permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry for albumin and Tc-99m-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid as a vascular tracer. Endothelial cell proliferation was assessed using in vivo BrdU labeling. During the first 24 h after irradiation, apoptotic endothelial cells were observed in the rat spinal cord. The decrease in endothelial cell density at 24 h after irradiation was associated with an increase in albumin immunostaining around microvessels. The decrease in the number of endothelial cells persisted for 7 days and recovery of endothelial density was apparent by day 14. A similar pattern of blood-spinal cord barrier disruption and recovery of permeability was observed over the 2 weeks, and an increase in BrdU-Iabeled endothelial cells was seen at day 3. These results are consistent with an association between endothelial cell death and acute blood-spinal cord barrier disruption in the rat spinal cord after irradiation.

The gap-junction protein connexin43 (Cx43), which is transiently up-regulated, has been implicated in the spread of 'bystander' damage. We have used an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (asODN) to suppress Cx43 up-regulation in two rat models of spinal cord injury. Within 24 h of compression injury, rats treated with Cx43-asODN scored higher than sense-ODN and vehicle-treated controls on behavioural tests of locomotion. Their spinal cords showed less swelling and tissue disruption, less up-regulation of astrocytic GFAP, and less extravasation of fluorescently-labelled bovine serum albumin and neutrophils. The locomotor improvement Was Sustained over at least 4 weeks. Following partial spinal cord transection, Cx43-asODN treatment reduced GFAP immunoreactivity, neutrophil recruitment, and the activity of OX42(+) microglia in and around the lesion site. Cx43 has many potential roles in the pathophysiology of CNS injury and may be a valuable target for therapeutic intervention. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This lack of regeneration is crucially influenced by neurite growth inhibitory protein constituents of CNS myelin. We have shown previously that a monoclonal antibody (mAb IN-1) capable of binding and neutralizing Nogo-A, a myelin-associated inhibitor of neurite growth, can induce long-distance axonal regeneration and increased structural plasticity with improved functional recovery in rat models of CNS injury. In this paper we demonstrate that a partially humanized, recombinant Fab fragment (rIN-1 Fab) derived from the original mAb IN-1, was able to promote long-distance regeneration of injured axons in the spinal cord of adult rats. When infused into a spinal cord injury site, regrowth of corticospinal fibers in 11 of 18 animals was observed after a survival time of 2 weeks. Regenerating fibers grew for >9 mm beyond the lesion site and arborized profusely in the distal cord. Regenerated fibers formed terminal arbors with varicosities in the spinal cord gray matter, strongly resembling synaptic points of contact to neurons in the spinal cord distal to the lesion. In animals that had received a bovine serum albumin solution or a recombinant IN-1 fragment that had been mutated in the antigen binding site (mutIN-1 Fab), no significant growth beyond normal lesion-induced sprouting was observed. Neutralization of endogenous nerve growth inhibitors represents a novel use of recombinant antibody technology with potential therapeutic applications after traumatic CNS lesions."

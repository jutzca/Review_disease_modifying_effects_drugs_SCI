Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) actively proliferate after SCI, but many of these cells undergo apoptosis. One of the factors that exacerbates secondary injury is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we tested the effects of amiloride treatment on the fate of OPCs during secondary injury in rats. Amiloride is an FDA-approved diuretic for treating hypertension, which in rats enhances ER stress response and suppresses the apoptosis of glial cells after SCI. A severe contusive SCI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using an infinite horizon (IH)-impactor (200 kdyne). Beginning 24 h after SCI, 10 mg/kg of amiloride or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was intraperitoneally administered daily for a period of 14 days. At 7, 14, 28, and 56 days after SCI, animals were subsequently euthanized in order to analyze the injured spinal cord. We labeled proliferating OPCs and demonstrated that amiloride treatment led to greater numbers of OPCs and oligodendrocytes in the injured spinal cord. Increased myelin basic protein (MBP) expression levels were observed, suggesting that increased numbers of mature oligodendrocytes led to improved remyelination, significantly improving motor function recovery."

Although recent studies have revealed that amiloride controls ER stress and leads to improvement in several neurological disorders including SCI, its mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we used a rat SCI model to assess the effects of amiloride on functional recovery, secondary damage expansion, ER stress-induced cell death and OPC survival. Hindlimb function in rats with spinal cord contusion significantly improved after amiloride administration. Amiloride significantly decreased the expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP in the injured spinal cord and significantly increased the expression of the ER chaperone GRP78, which protects cells against ER stress. In addition, amiloride treatment led to a significant decrease in ER stress-induced apoptosis and a significant increase of NG2-positive OPCs in the injured spinal cord. Furthermore, in vitro experiments performed to investigate the direct effect of amiloride on OPCs revealed that amiloride reduced CHOP expression in OPCs cultured under ER stress. These results suggest that amiloride controls ER stress in SCI and inhibits cellular apoptosis, contributing to OPC survival. The present study suggests that amiloride may be an effective treatment to reduce ER stress-induced cell death in the acute phase of SCI."

We tested amiloride's therapeutic potential in a clinically relevant rat model of contusion SCI inflicted at the thoracic segment T10. Rats receiving daily administration of amiloride from 24 h to 35 days after SCI exhibited a significant improvement in hindlimb locomotor ability at 21, 28, and 35 days after injury, when compared to vehicle-treated SCI rats. Rats receiving amiloride treatment also exhibited a significant increase in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) levels 35 days after SCI at the site of injury (T10) when compared to vehicle-treated controls, which indicated a partial reverse in the decrease of MOG observed with injury. Our data indicate that higher levels of MOG correlate with improved locomotor recovery after SCI, and that this may explain the beneficial effects of amiloride after SCI. Given that amiloride treatment after SCI caused a significant preservation of myelin levels, and improved locomotor recovery, it should be considered as a possible therapeutic intervention after SCI."

It is known that spinal cord injury (SCI) induces lasting decreases in Ang-1 levels, underlying endothelial barrier disruption, but the expression of Ang-2 in spinal cord injury has not been studied. We characterized Ang-2 after SCI using a clinically relevant rat model of contusion SCI. We found that SCI induces marked and persistent upregulation of Ang-2 (up to 10 weeks after SCI), which does not reflect well-characterized temporal profile of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) breakdown after SCI, and thus suggests other role(s) for Ang-2 in injured spinal cords. Furthermore, we also found that higher Ang-2 levels were associated with more successful locomotor recovery after SCI, both in SCI rats with markedly better spontaneous motor recovery and in SCI rats receiving a neuroprotective pharmacological intervention (amiloride), suggesting a beneficial role for Ang-2 in injured spinal cords. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that Ang-2 was not induced in endothelial cells, but in perivascular and non-vascular cells labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2). Therefore, it is unlikely that induction of Ang-2 contributes to vascular dysfunction underlying functional impairment after SCI, but rather that it contributes to the beneficial pro-angiogenic and/or gliogenic processes underlying recovery processes after SCI.

Perfusion of the spinal cord in 0-Ca2+ Ringer solution resulted in significantly improved recovery of the compound action potential. Similarly, removal of Na+ from the perfusate resulted in significantly improved recovery of conduction in dorsal column axons. Exposure of the anoxic spinal cord to the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), the Na-Ca exchange blockers benzamil and bepridil, Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride and harmaline, and perfusion in Ringer solution with pH adjusted to 6.4, all resulted in improved recovery. The tertiary anesthetics procaine and lidocaine, as well as phenytoin and carbamazepine, also resulted in improved recovery of compound action potential amplitude after 60 min of anoxia. These results demonstrate that a significant component of irreversible loss of conduction, following anoxic injury of the dorsal columns, is Ca2+-dependent. Moreover, these results demonstrate that TTX-inhibitable Na+ channels participate in the pathophysiology of anoxic injury in spinal cord white matter, and indicate that reverse Na-Ca exchange provides a route for at least part of the damaging influx of Ca2+ into an intracellular compartment in anoxic spinal cord white matter. Our results also suggest that extracellular acidosis may have a protective effect on anoxic spinal cord white matter, and support the hypothesis that anoxic injury of spinal cord white matter may involve the Na+-H+ exchanger."

In this study, we examined the role of Na+ in mediating traumatic injury to spinal cord axons. Dorsal column segments from adult rats (n = 87) were isolated and maintained in an in vitro recording chamber while being superfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution (95% O-2/5% CO2, 25 degrees C). Selected experiments (n = 10) also were done at 33 degrees C. Compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded from microelectrodes. Injury was performed by compression of the dorsal column segment for 15 sec with a modified aneurysm clip exerting a closing force of 2 gm. With injury, the CAP decreased to 72.1 +/- 9.6% of baseline values. Removal of extracellular Na+ and replacement with the impermeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine enhanced recovery of the CAP to 98.3 +/- 18.3% (p < 0.05) of baseline. The Na+ channel blockers tetrodotoxin and procaine also improved recovery of the CAP to 96.3 +/- 23.7% (p < 0.05) and 82.8 +/- 4.6% (p < 0.05) of baseline values, respectively. In contrast, increasing Na+ permeability with veratridine resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude after 1 hr of trauma (60.1 +/- 8.4%, p < 0.05). Similarly, prevention of extrusion of Nai from the intracellular compartment by inhibiting the Na+-K+-ATPase pump with ouabain resulted in greater attenuation of CAP amplitude at 1 hr after trauma (56.7 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.05). The Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride (100 mu M) and harmaline (100 mu M) significantly improved recovery after injury to 89.6 +/- 17.0% (p < 0.05) and 85.7 +/- 7.2% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively. However, administration of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange blockers benzamil (100 or 500 mu M) and bepridil (50 mu M) was ineffective. In summary, reduction of extracellular Na+ confers neuroprotection after spinal cord injury in vitro. Intracellular sodium rises appear to be mediated by voltage-gated Na+ channels. Blockade of the Na+-H+ exchanger also is neuroprotective, possibly by reducing intracellular acidosis. Furthermore, prevention of extrusion of intracellular Na+ by the Na+-K+-ATPase pump exacerbates the effects of compression trauma. However, reverse operation of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger does not explain the injurious effects of Na+ in traumatically injured CNS white matter."

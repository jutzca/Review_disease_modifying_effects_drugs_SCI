In initial experiments, animals were subjected to 25, 50 or 100 g cm impact injuries at T10 during pentobarbital or halothane anesthesia and their outcomes determined using somatosensory-evoked potentials, blinded neurologic evaluations for two weeks, and post-mortem analysis of spinal serotonin levels. Subsequently, halothane anesthesia was combined with either pentobarbital or nitrous oxide or given as a late treatment to pentobarbital anesthetized rats subjected to 50 g cm injuries. A series of acute studies were then performed in order to assess the hemodynamic and respiratory concomitants of halothane vs. pentobarbital, as well as the effect of mechanical ventilation and bicarbonate treatment upon halothane neuroprotection. Finally, the effect of a 50 g cm impact upon local white matter spinal cord blood flow was measured during halothane or pentobarbital anesthesia using laser-Doppler flowmetry."

This paper advocates that BoTx should be used as a neuro-relearning tool that can significantly improve recovery in motor paralytic disorders. BoTx generates redundant numbers of synapses at motor endplates and at spinal motoneuron-interneurons. It facilitates muscle activity-dependent synapse competition at these two sites. Redundancy and competition-based selection of synaptic connections are naturally occurring learning-related plasticity events during infant motor learning-now familiarly known as competitive-learning. Thus when injected in small doses to multiple muscles of a paralyzed limb, BoTx can recreate and replay those competitive-learning processes in the learning resistant paralyzed brain centers. Computational modeling, humanoid robot, and animal studies reveal that motor re) learning can be significantly faster if competitive-learning mechanisms are employed in the paralyzed system. A treatment protocol is presented that aims to keep the paralyzing effects of BoTx minimized while prolonging relearning duration. Recent clinical studies strongly attest that small-dose; multi-muscle, repeat regimens improve function. The principal objective of the present paper is that future multi-muscle clinical studies will take note of the relearning properties of BoTx and make full utilization of this therapeutic effect."

Electrophysiological examinations are advantageous over clinical examinations, as they can reliably be applied also in uncooperative patients. They provide an early diagnosis of the functional deficit in patients with acute SCI and are predictive of recovery of specific functions. The results of tibial nerve SSEP and MEP of the anterior tibial muscle allow the prediction of the outcome of ambulatory capacity, and pudendal nerve SSEP that of bladder function. In tetraplegic patients median and ulnar nerve SSEP and MEP of the abductor digiti min. muscle can indicate the development of hand function. Finally, neurographic recordings of upper and lower limbs allow differentiation between the proportion of peripheral and central nerve lesion underlying muscle paresis. This is of prognostic value in regard to the development of muscle tone and consequently for planning of an adequate therapy. Thus, electrophysiological examinations complement the assessment of spinal cord lesion, they are predictive of functional outcome, and are able to monitor the course of neurological deficit. Therefore, the data are helpful for planning and selecting the appropriate therapeutical approaches (e.g. functional electrical stimulation, application of botulinum toxin, splinting procedures) within the rehabilitation programme.

BoNTs exert their action by blocking SNARE (soluble N-ethylmale-imide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors) complex formation and vesicle release from the neuronal terminal through the specific cleavage of SNARE proteins. The action of BoNTs at the neuromuscular junction has been extensively investigated and knowledge gained in this field has set the foundation for the use of these toxins in a variety of human pathologies characterized by excessive muscle contractions. In parallel, BoNTs became a cosmetic drug due to its power to ward off facial wrinkles following the activity of the mimic muscles. Successively, BoNTs became therapeutic agents that have proven to be successful in the treatment of different neurological disorders, with new indications emerging or being approved each year. In particular, BoNT/A became the treatment of excellence not only for muscle hyperactivity conditions, such as dystonia and spasticity, but also to reduce pain in a series of painful states, such as neuropathic pain, lumbar and myofascial pain, and to treat various dysfunctions of the urinary bladder. This review summarizes recent experimental findings on the potential efficacy of BoNTs in favoring nerve regeneration after traumatic injury in the peripheral nervous system, such as the injury of peripheral nerves, like sciatic nerve, and in the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury."

This study investigates whether dietary supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) improves functional recovery after SCI. Female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either with a normal diet or a dietary regiment supplemented with vitamin E (51 IU/g) for eight weeks. The rats were subsequently exposed either to a contusive SCI or sham operation, and evaluated using standard functional behavior analysis. We report that the rats that consumed the vitamin E-enriched diet showed an accelerated bladder recovery and significant improvements in locomotor function relative to controls, as determined by residual volumes and Basso, Beatie, and Bresnaham BBB scores, respectively. Interestingly, the prophylactic dietary intervention did not preserve neurons in the ventral horn of injured rats, but it significantly increased the numbers of oligodendrocytes. Vitamin E supplementation attenuated the depression of the H-reflex (a typical functional consequence of SCI) while increasing the levels of supraspinal serotonin immunoreactivity. Our findings support the potential complementary use of vitamin E to ameliorate sensory and autonomic dysfunctions associated with spinal cord injury, and identified promising new cellular and functional targets of its neuroprotective effects."

In this open label study, we aim to evaluate the effect of the BoNT-A on the spinal nociception in patients affected by spasticity of the lower limbs with associated pain with predominantly neuropathic features. Ten patients with stroke, 10 with multiple sclerosis and 5 with spinal cord injury were enrolled in the study. They were tested with clinical scales (neuropathic pain scale inventory (NPSI), numerical rating scale (NRS), modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and with the nociceptive withdrawal reflex at lower limbs to explore the spinal temporal summation threshold at baseline and 30 day after BoNT-A injection. OnabotulinumtoxinA (50 to 200 units per site) was injected in the lower limb muscles according to the distribution of spasticity. No significant differences were found at baseline for neurophysiological features across groups. After the BoNT-A injection, we recorded a significant reduction in MAS and NRS scores. Regarding the neurophysiological parameters, we described a significant increase in the temporal summation threshold after the BoNT-A injection. Our data supports the hypothesis that peripherally injected OnabotulinumtoxinA modulates the excitability of spinal cord nociceptive pathways. This activity may take place irrespective of the effect of the drug on spasticity."

Injections of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) into the urethral sphincter have been used to treat urethral sphincter dysfunction (USD) refractory to conventional treatment. Since its first use for patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in 1988, BoNT-A has been applied to various causes of USD, including dysfunctional voiding, Fowler's syndrome, and poor relaxation of the external urethral sphincter. BoNT-A is believed to decrease urethral resistance via paralysis of the striated sphincter muscle through inhibition of acetylcholine release in the neuromuscular junction. Recovery of detrusor function in patients with detrusor underactivity combined with a hyperactive sphincter also suggested the potential neuromodulation effect of sphincteric BoNT-A injection. A large proportion of patients with different causes of USD report significant improvement in voiding after sphincteric BoNT-A injections. However, patient satisfaction might not increase with an improvement in the symptoms because of concomitant side effects including exacerbated incontinence, urinary urgency, and over-expectation. Nonetheless, in terms of efficacy and safety, BoNT-A is still a reasonable option for refractory voiding function. To date, studies focusing on urethral sphincter BoNT-A injections have been limited to the heterogeneous etiologies of USD. Further well-designed studies are thus needed."

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in RM group and SMTC group compared with their corresponding controls, respectively. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the common DEGs identified in both RM group and SMTC group. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of the overlapping DEGs were performed. Furthermore, the common DEGs enriched in each pathway were analyzed to identify significant regulatory elements. Totally, 173 overlapping DEGs (130 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated) were identified in both RM and SMTC samples. These overlapping DEGs were enriched in different GO terms. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly related to inflammation and immunity. CD68 molecule (CD68) was a hub protein in the PPI network. Moreover, the regulatory network showed that ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (RAC2), CD44 molecule (CD44), and actin related protein 2/3 complex (ARPC1B) were hub genes. RAC2, CD44, and ARPC1B may be significantly involved in the pathogenesis of SCI by participating significant pathways such as extracellular matrix-receptor signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway."

Spinal reflex abnormalities contribute to these impairments. Spinal reflex measurements play important roles in characterizing and monitoring neurological disorders and their associated motor impairments, such as spasticity, which affects nearly half of those with neurological disorders. Spinal reflexes can also serve as therapeutic targets themselves. Operant conditioning protocols can target beneficial plasticity to key reflex pathways; they can thereby trigger wider plasticity that improves impaired motor skills, such as locomotion. These protocols may complement standard therapies such as locomotor training and enhance functional recovery. This paper reviews the value of spinal reflexes and the therapeutic promise of spinal reflex operant conditioning protocols; it also considers the complex process of translating this promise into clinical reality."

Injury at cervical region poses additional problems for any surgical intervention with life-threatening risks of i) endangering respiratory function, ii) cavitation, cysts, and syringomyelia formation extending cephalad to the injury, and iii) mid-lower cervical injuries, lower motor neuron death, and the resultant degeneration of brachial plexus axons would still leave the upper limbs denervated and paralyzed even as treatment procedures might successfully salvage the lower limbs. With these apparently, insurmountable impediments in quadriplegic cord repair, it would be wise to turn to alternative treatment strategies. Conventional treatment models since the days of Ralph Gerard (1940) have all used intra-vertebral procedures. We present here a plausible extra-vertebral repair model suitable for incomplete cord injuries at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. The procedure consists of identifying the extent of viable grey-white matter in the injured area and to utilize it efficiently as a ""neural tissue bridge."" Next, labile state is induced by using botulinum toxin/colchicine (Krishnan, 1983, 1991; Krishnan et al., 2001a,b) and Ca+ channel blockers in the motor-sensory nerve terminals of polisegmentally innervated skeletal muscles that ""bridge"" the injured cord segments. This would retrogradely induce a redundant state of intra-spinal growth of nerve terminals and new synaptic connections within those viable neural tissues, as well as promote effective relinking of the injured cord ends and enhance motor-sensory recovery."

BoNT-A-induced temporal muscle weakness has been used to manage skeletal muscle spasticity, such as poststroke spasticity, cerebral palsy, and cervical dystonia. However, the combined effect of treadmill exercise and BoNT-A treatment is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that for rats, following BoNT-A injection in the gastrocnemius muscle, treadmill running improved the recovery of the sciatic functional index (SFI), muscle contraction strength, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and area. Treadmill training had no influence on gastrocnemius mass that received BoNT-A injection, but it improved the maximal contraction force of the gastrocnemius, and upregulation of GAP-43, IGF-1, Myo-D, Myf-5, myogenin, and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits alpha and beta was found following treadmill training.

Developing locomotor system and computer simulation studies show that motor learning requires the presence of redundant sets of competing synapses within the spinal cord interneurons. The new exercise regimens have not addressed this essential prerequisite; this could perhaps explain the long delays in recovery. We recommend that inclusion of inductive lability procedure (Krishnan, 1983, 1991, 2003) will help hasten and enhance the recovery."

Embase and Medline databases were used to identify literature relevant to the early urological care of SCI patients. Recommendations were developed by consensus and graded using a modified Oxford system which identifies level of evidence (LOE) and grade of recommendation (GOR).ResultsClinicians must ensure appropriate bladder emptying immediately after SCI (LOE 3, GOR A) and perform the initial neuro-urological assessment within 3months after injury (LOE 3, GOR A), including history, validated questionnaires, bladder diary, physical examination, measurement of renal function, and urinary tract imaging (LOE 4, GOR B). Urodynamics, if available video-urodynamics, must be performed to detect and specify lower urinary tract dysfunction (LOE 1, GOR A). Spontaneous voiding and/or intermittent catheterization must be considered in appropriate patients once they are medically stable (LOE 3, GOR A). Antimuscarinics are the first-line and intradetrusor botulinum toxin A injections are the second-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity (LOE 1, GOR A). Irreversible surgical interventions should be delayed until the second year after injury due to the potential for neurological recovery (LOE 4, GOR B).ConclusionsCareful clinical assessment and pertinent urological testing including urodynamic investigation are necessary for appropriate counselling and treatment of new SCI patients."

Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings we evaluated the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons in female rats at the L6/S1 level when urinary bladder pressure was abruptly increased. Intravesical infusion of ATP and systemic application of suramin allowed us to evaluate the contribution of urothelial purinergic receptors. Rats were anesthetized with isofluorane. Suprapubic, venous and tracheal catheters were implanted. Laminectomy was performed at the L6-51 spinal levels. The cervical spinal cord was transected, and rats were mechanically pithed. Anesthesia was stopped, rats were ventilated, and a muscle relaxant was administered. The frequency of spinal neural activity was recorded via tungsten electrodes inserted into the dorsal horn at the L6-S1 level. The signal was amplified, filtered and recorded with a data acquisition system at 10 kHz sampling rate. Vital signs as well as bladder pressure were monitored in real time. We evaluated field potentials during intravesical pressure steps ranging from 0 to 60 cm H2O in (A) control (saline in the bladder), (B) after stimulation of urothelial purinergic receptors (1 mM vesical ATP), and (C) after the intravenous application of the non-specific purinergic antagonist suramin (100 mg/kg). Pressure steps were maintained for 1 min followed by 3 min for recovery. Only neurons that showed an increased activity during bladder distention were evaluated. Under control conditions, the generation of field potentials increased concomitantly with bladder pressure steps, showing an activity change threshold between 20 and 40 cm H2O. Intravesical application of 1 mM ATP produced an increase in baseline activity, indicative of noxious stimulation, and spinal neuronal activity markedly increased above 40 cm H2O pressure. Systemic suramin prevented the increase in neural activity in response to pressure changes, even after intravesical ATP. These results suggest that urothelial purinergic receptors are important modulators of lumbosacral dorsal spinal neuronal activity. The inhibitory effects of suramin imply that enhanced lumbosacral neuronal signals result from activation of C-fibers during noxious bladder stimulation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc."

Neuropathic pain (NP) results from a dysfunction and derangement in the transmission and signal processing along the nervous system and it is a recognized disease in itself. The prevalence of NP is estimated to be between 6.9% and 10% in the general population. This condition can complicate the recovery from stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord lesions, and several neuropathies promoting persistent disability and poor quality of life. Subjects suffering from NP describe it as burning, itching, lancing, and numbness, but hyperalgesia and allodynia represent the most bothersome symptoms. The management of NP is a clinical challenge and several non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions have been proposed with variable benefits. Botulinum toxin (BTX) as an adjunct to other interventions can be a useful therapeutic tool for the treatment of disabled people. Although BTX-A is predominantly used to reduce spasticity in a neuro-rehabilitation setting, it has been used in several painful conditions including disorders characterized by NP. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms that operate in reducing pain are still unclear and include blocking nociceptor transduction, the reduction of neurogenic inflammation by inhibiting neural substances and neurotransmitters, and the prevention of peripheral and central sensitization. Some neurological disorders requiring rehabilitative intervention can show neuropathic pain resistant to common analgesic treatment. This paper addresses the effect of BTX-A in treating NP that complicates frequent disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system such as spinal cord injury, post-stroke shoulder pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy, which are commonly managed in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, BTX-A has an effect in relief pain that may characterize less common neurological disorders including post-traumatic neuralgia, phantom limb, and complex regional pain syndrome with focal dystonia. The use of BTX-A could represent a novel therapeutic strategy in caring for neuropathic pain whenever common pharmacological tools have been ineffective. However, large and well-designed clinical trials are needed to recommend BTX-A use in the relief of neuropathic pain."

For example, in both animals and people, an operant-conditioning protocol can increase or decrease the spinal stretch reflex or its electrical analog, the H-reflex. Reflex change is associated with plasticity in the pathway of the reflex as well as elsewhere in the spinal cord and brain. Because these pathways serve many different behaviors, the plasticity produced by this conditioning can change other behaviors. Thus, in animals or people with partial spinal cord injuries, appropriate reflex conditioning can improve locomotion. Furthermore, in people with spinal cord injuries, appropriate reflex conditioning can trigger widespread beneficial plasticity. This wider plasticity appears to reflect an iterative process through which the multiple behaviors in the individual's repertoire negotiate the properties of the spinal neurons and synapses that they all use. Operant-conditioning protocols are a promising new therapeutic method that could complement other rehabilitation methods and enhance functional recovery. Their successful use requires strict adherence to appropriately designed procedures, as well as close attention to accommodating and engaging the individual subject in the conditioning process."

Moreover, rodent models of SCI at lumbar levels have been widely used to validate therapeutic scenarios aimed at the restoration of locomotor activities. Despite the growing use of the rat as a model of locomotor dysfunction, knowledge regarding the anatomical relationship between spinal cord motor neurons and the hindlimb muscles that they innervate is incomplete. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have shown the details of the muscle/motor neuron topographical relationship for the mouse forelimb and hindlimb as well as for the rat forelimb. The present analysis aims to characterize the segmental distribution of the motor neuron pools that innervate the muscles of the rat hindlimb, hence completing this series of studies. The location of the motor end plate (MEP) regions on the main muscles of the rat hindlimb was first revealed with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. For each muscle under scrutiny, injections of Fluoro-Gold were then performed along the length of the MEP region. Targeting the MEPs gave rise to columns of motor neurons that span more spinal cord segments than previously reported.

Spinal cord transection was performed at the T-9-T-10 level 2-3 weeks prior to the experiment and a microdialysis fiber was inserted in the L-6-S-1, lumbosacral spinal cord one day before the experiments. Mechanically evoked (i.e. 10 cm/W bladder pressure) ATP release into the bladder lumen was approximately 6.5-fold higher in SCI compared to NI rats (p < 0.05). Intravesical carbachol (CCh) induced a significantly greater release of ATP in the bladder from SCI as compared to NI rats (3424.32 +/- 1255.57 pmol/ml versus 613.74 +/- 470.44 pmol/ml, respectively, p < 0.05). However, ATP release in NI or SCI rats to intravesical CCh was not affected by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Atr). Spinal release of ATP to bladder stimulation with 10 cm/W pressure was five-fold higher in SCI compared to NI rats (p < 0.05). CCh also induced a significantly greater release of spinal ATP in SCI rats compared to controls (4.3 +/- 0.9 pmol versus 0.90 +/- 0.15 pmol, p < 0.05). Surprisingly, the percent inhibitory effect of Atr on CCh-induced ATP release was less pronounced in SCI as compared to NI rats (49% versus 89%, respectively). SCI induces a dramatic increase in intravesical pressure and cholinergic receptor evoked bladder and spinal ATP release. Muscarinic receptors do not mediate intravesical CCh-induced ATP release into the bladder lumen in NI or SCI rats. In NI rats sensory muscarinic receptors are the predominant mechanism by which CCh induces ATP release from primary afferents within the lumbosacral spinal cord. Following SCL however, nicotinic or purinergic receptor mechanisms become active, as evidenced by the fact that Atr was only partially effective in inhibiting CCh-induced spinal ATP release.

Morphologically, the acute loss of bone tissue appeared to arise primarily due to osteoclastic bone resorption. Given that the loss of muscle function in this model is transient, we speculated that the stimulus for osteoclastic activation would be rapid and morphologic evidence of bone resorption would appear before 21 days. We therefore utilized high-resolution in vivo serial micro-CT to assess longitudinal alterations in lower hindlimb muscle volume, proximal tibia trabecular, and tibia mid-diaphysis cortical bone morphology in 16-week-old female C57 mice following transient calf paralysis from a single injection of botulinum toxin A (BtA; 2U/100 g body weight). In an acute study, we evaluated muscle and bone alterations at days 0, 3, 5, and 12 following transient calf paralysis. In a chronic study, following day 0 imaging, we assessed the recovery of these tissues following the maximum observed trabecular degradation (day 12) through day 84 post-paralysis. The time course and degree of recovery of muscle, trabecular, and cortical bone varied substantially. Significant atrophy of lower limb muscle was evident by day 5 of paralysis, maximal at day 28 (-34.1 +/- 0.9%) and partially recovered by day 84. Trabecular degradation within the proximal tibia metaphysis occurred more rapidly, with significant reduction in BV/TV by day 3, maximal loss at day 12 (-76.8 +/- 2.9%) with only limited recovery by day 84 (-51.7 +/- 5.1% vs. day 0). Significant cortical bone volume degradation at the tibia mid-diaphysis was first identified at day 12, was maximal at day 28 (-9.6 +/- 1.2%), but completely recovered by day 84. The timing, magnitude, and morphology of the observed bone erosion induced by transient muscle paralysis were consistent with a rapid recruitment and prolific activation of osteoclastic resorption. In a broader context, understanding how brief paralysis of a single muscle group can precipitate such rapid and profound bone resorption in an adjacent bone is likely to provide new insight into how normal muscle function modulates bone homeostasis.

To explore the therapeutic application of these protocols, we studied the impact of down-conditioning the soleus H-reflex in people with impaired locomotion caused by chronic incomplete spinal cord injury. After a baseline period in which soleus H-reflex size was measured and locomotion was assessed, subjects completed either 30 H-reflex down-conditioning sessions (DC subjects) or 30 sessions in which the H-reflex was simply measured [unconditioned (UC) subjects], and locomotion was reassessed. Over the 30 sessions, the soleus H-reflex decreased in two-thirds of the DC subjects (a success rate similar to that in normal subjects) and remained smaller several months later. In these subjects, locomotion became faster and more symmetrical, and the modulation of EMG activity across the step cycle increased bilaterally. Furthermore, beginning about halfway through the conditioning sessions, all of these subjects commented spontaneously that they were walking faster and farther in their daily lives, and several noted less clonus, easier stepping, and/or other improvements. The H-reflex did not decrease in the other DC subjects or in any of the UC subjects; and their locomotion did not improve. These results suggest that reflex-conditioning protocols can enhance recovery of function after incomplete spinal cord injuries and possibly in other disorders as well. Because they are able to target specific spinal pathways, these protocols could be designed to address each individual's particular deficits, and might thereby complement other rehabilitation methods."

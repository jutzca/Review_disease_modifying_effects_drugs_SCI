McClellan","Regulation of axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury in the lamprey",2017,"Journal Of Neurophysiology","Amer Physiological Soc","","",4,"2021-01-16 13:09:14","Article","10.1152/jn.00986.2016","0022-3077","",118,3,1439,1456,2,0.50,0,8,4,"Following rostral spinal cord injury (SCI) in larval lampreys, injured descending brain neurons, particularly reticulospinal (RS) neurons, regenerate their axons, and locomotor behavior recovers in a few weeks. However, axonal regeneration of descending brain neurons is mostly limited to relatively short distances, but the mechanisms for incomplete axonal regeneration are unclear. First, lampreys with rostral SCI exhibited greater axonal regeneration of descending brain neurons, including RS neurons, as well as more rapid recovery of locomotor muscle activity right below the lesion site, compared with animals with caudal SCI. In addition, following rostral SCI, most injured RS neurons displayed the ""injury phenotype,"" whereas following caudal SCI, most injured neurons displayed normal electrical properties. Second, following rostral SCI, at cold temperatures (similar to 4-5 degrees C), axonal transport was suppressed, axonal regeneration and behavioral recovery were blocked, and injured RS neurons displayed normal electrical properties. Cold temperatures appear to prevent injured RS neurons from detecting and/or responding to SCI. It is hypothesized that following rostral SCI, injured descending brain neurons are strongly stimulated to regenerate their axons, presumably because of elimination of spinal synapses and reduced neurotrophic support. However, when these neurons regenerate their axons and make synapses right below the lesion site, restoration of neurotrophic support very likely suppress further axonal regeneration. In contrast, caudal SCI is a weak stimulus for axonal regeneration, presumably because of spared synapses above the lesion site. These results may have implications for mammalian SCI, which can spare synapses above the lesion site for supraspinal descending neurons and propriospinal neurons."

But what are the prospects for quadriplegics? Certain fundamental issues make treatment approaches to quadriplegia different and difficult. Injury at cervical region poses additional problems for any surgical intervention with life-threatening risks of i) endangering respiratory function, ii) cavitation, cysts, and syringomyelia formation extending cephalad to the injury, and iii) mid-lower cervical injuries, lower motor neuron death, and the resultant degeneration of brachial plexus axons would still leave the upper limbs denervated and paralyzed even as treatment procedures might successfully salvage the lower limbs. With these apparently, insurmountable impediments in quadriplegic cord repair, it would be wise to turn to alternative treatment strategies. Conventional treatment models since the days of Ralph Gerard (1940) have all used intra-vertebral procedures. We present here a plausible extra-vertebral repair model suitable for incomplete cord injuries at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. The procedure consists of identifying the extent of viable grey-white matter in the injured area and to utilize it efficiently as a ""neural tissue bridge."" Next, labile state is induced by using botulinum toxin/colchicine (Krishnan, 1983, 1991; Krishnan et al., 2001a,b) and Ca+ channel blockers in the motor-sensory nerve terminals of polisegmentally innervated skeletal muscles that ""bridge"" the injured cord segments. This would retrogradely induce a redundant state of intra-spinal growth of nerve terminals and new synaptic connections within those viable neural tissues, as well as promote effective relinking of the injured cord ends and enhance motor-sensory recovery."

As this was not part of the original experimental design, we subsequently compared pathological and functional outcomes of SCI in female C57BL/6 mice who received fenbendazole (150 ppm, 8 mg/kg body weight/day) for 4 weeks prior to moderate contusive SCI (50 kdyn force) as compared to mice on the same diet without added fenbendazole. The fenbendazole-treated mice exhibited improved locomotor function, determined using the Basso mouse scale, as well as improved tissue sparing following contusive SCI. Fenbendazole may exert protective effects through multiple possible mechanisms, one of which is inhibition of the proliferation of B lymphocytes, thereby reducing antibody responses. Autoantibodies produced following SCI contribute to the axon damage and locomotor deficits. Fenbendazole pretreatment reduced the injury-induced CD45R-positive B cell signal intensity and IgG immunoreactivity at the lesion epicenter 6 weeks after contusive SCI in mice, consistent with a possible effect on the immune response to the injury. Fenbendazole and related benzimadole antihelmintics are FDA approved, exhibit minimal toxicity, and represent a novel group of potential therapeutics targeting secondary mechanisms following SCI.

TMT (a single oral gavage of 6.0 mg TMT HCl/kg body weight) reduced hippocampal weight, decreased hippocampal cell counts, decreased autoshaped learning measures, and suppressed progressive fixed ratio (PFR) lever pressing without affecting stable lever pressing. Neither GM1 nor greater food restriction affected hippocampal weight. Greater food restriction prevented TMT's effects on a utoshaping but not on PFR behavior, was without behavioral effects in animals not treated with TMT, and did not affect hippocampal histology. GM1 prevented certain TMT-induced decremen ts in autoshaping and PFR behavior but also suppressed autoshaping and stimulated stable fixed ratio behavior in animals not treated with TMT. GM1 also reduced hippocampal serotonin concentration, another ''lesion-like'' change. GM1 blocked TMT-induced hippocampal CA3b cell loss, but did not protect CA3c cells, the main locus of TMT hippocampal damage. The results support the idea that exogenous GM1 is a potent neuroactive agent with complex actions in intact organisms, potentially beneficial and potentially toxic. Like GM1, food restriction induces complex and potentialy beneficial effects, but it lacked GM1's biochemical and behavioral ''side effects'' (i.e. toxicity) in these experiments.

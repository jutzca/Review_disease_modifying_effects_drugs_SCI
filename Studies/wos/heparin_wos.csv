Although a wide range of therapeutic agents have been shown to attenuate secondary injury or promote regeneration/repair in animal models of spinal cord injury, clinical translation of these strategies has been limited, in part due to difficulty in safely and effectively achieving therapeutic concentrations in the injured spinal cord tissue. Hydrogel-based drug delivery systems offer unique opportunities to locally deliver drugs to the injured spinal cord with sufficient dose and duration, while avoiding deleterious side effects associated with systemic drug administration. Such local drug delivery systems can be readily fabricated from biocompatible and biodegradable materials. In this review, hydrogel-based strategies for local drug delivery to the injured spinal cord are extensively reviewed, and recommendations are made for implementation."

Neuroprotective strategies have been applied aiming to prevent secondary cell death but no successful and robust effects have been observed. Recently, combinatorial approaches using biomaterials with cells and/or growth factors have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects because of the improvement of axonal growth and in vivo functional recovery in model organisms. In situ injectable hydrogels are a particularly attractive neuroregenerative approach to improve spinal cord repair and regeneration since they can be precisely injected into the lesion site filling the space prior to gelification, decrease scarring and promote axon growth due to the hydrogel?s soft structure. Important advances regarding the use of hydrogels as potential therapeutic approaches has been reported during the last 10 years. Injectable alginate hydrogel loaded with GDNF, thermoresponsives heparin-poloxamer loaded with NGF and imidazole-poly(organophosphazenes) hydrogels are just three examples of biomaterials that can promote neurite, axon growth and improve functional recovery in hemisected and resected rats. Here we will review the status of in situ injectable hydrogels for spinal cord regeneration with special focus in the advantages of using hydrogel scaffolds, the ideal polymers to be used, the gelification process and the cells or growth factors combined. The in vitro and in vivo results reported for those biomaterials will be presented, compared and discussed."

METHODS: Studies related to the treatment for acute spinal cord injury were identified via a search of National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC, 2000-11), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2011), TRIP Database (2000-11), and PubMed (1966-2011). Treatment strategies were formulated according to three basic principles: best evidence, doctor's professional experience, and wishes of the patient. RESULTS: A total of 34 articles were selected, including 1 NGC guideline, 22 systematic reviews, and 11 randomized controlled trials. Based on our review, we arrived at the following recommendations: no clinical evidence exists definitively to recommend the use of any of neuroprotective pharmaceuticals; surgery should be undertaken early; mechanical compression devices and low-molecular weight heparin should be employed to prevent thrombosis; respiratory muscle training is beneficial for pulmonary function and quality of life; and functional electrical stimulation and acupuncture can promote functional recovery. The patient accordingly underwent surgery 6 hours after trauma without receiving any neuroprotective pharmaceuticals; low-molecular weight heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression were applied to prevent thrombosis. He also underwent respiratory muscle training daily for 8 weeks and received functional electrical stimulation for 15 minutes and acupuncture for 30 minutes every day. After follow-up for 3 months, the above therapeutic regimen was confirmed efficacious for acute spinal cord injury. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based medicine provides an individualized treatment protocol for acute spinal cord injury, which can significantly improve the therapeutic effect and prognosis."

Previous studies have shown that a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) contribute to a protective effect on injured neuronal cells, but the mechanism of SCI repair is still unclear. In this study, in situ heparin (HeP) hydrogel injection containing bFGF and DPSCs (HeP-bFGF-DPSCs), as well as in vitro studies of bFGF and DPSCs, proved an effective control over inflammation. The in vivo application of HeP-bFGF-DPSCs regulated inflammatory reactions and accelerated the nerve regeneration through micro- tubule stabilization and tissue vasculature. Our mechanistic investigation also showed that bFGF-DPSCs treatment inhibited microglia/macrophage proliferation and activation. Furthermore, HeP-bFGF-DPSCs prevented microglia/macrophage activation and reduced proinflammatory cytokine release. In this paper, we discovered that bFGF and DPSCs worked together to attenuate tissue inflammation of the injured spinal cord, resulting in a superior nerve repair. Our results indicated that a thermosensitive hydrogel delivering bFGF and DPSCs could serve as a promising treatment option for spinal cord injuries."

The indispensable importance and distinct physiological structure of cerebrospinal area bring about challenges to biomaterials in LDDS. Thus, properties of drug delivery systems are necessitated with prudently concern.

However, the poor physicochemical stability of GDNF, as well as its limited ability to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier, hampers the development of GDNF as an effective therapeutic intervention in clinical practice. In this study, a novel temperature-sensitive heparin-poloxamer (HP) hydrogel with high GDNF-binding affinity was developed. HP hydrogels showed a supporting scaffold for GDNF when it was injected into the lesion epicenter after SCI. GDNF-HP by orthotopic injection on lesioned spinal cord promoted the beneficial effects of GDNF on neural stem cell proliferation, reactive astrogliosis inhibition, axonal regeneration or plasticity, neuroprotection against cell apoptosis, and body functional recovery. Most interestingly, GDNF demonstrated a bidirectional regulation of autophagy, which inhibited cell apoptosis at different stages of SCI.

CSPG-mediated inhibition is mainly associated with the glycosaminoglycan chains of CSPGs, and chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) is the predominant sulfated structure that regulates axonal guidance and growth in the adult nervous system. With the aim to find molecules that neutralize the inhibitory functions of C4S, we screened a phage display library for peptides binding to C4S. From the phage clones binding to C4S we selected three peptides for further analysis. We observed that these peptides bind to C4S, but not chondroitin-6-sulfate, heparin sulfate or dermatan sulfate, in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, whereas the scrambled peptides showed highly reduced or no binding to C4S. The C4S-binding peptides, but not their scrambled counterparts, when added to cultures of mouse cerebellar neurons and human neuroblastoma cells, neutralized the inhibitory functions of the C4S- and CSPG-coated substrate on cell adhesion, neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that the C4S-binding peptides neutralize several inhibitory functions of CSPGs, suggesting that they may be beneficial in repairing mammalian nervous system injuries."

To maintain radial glial cell (RGC) character of primitive neural precursors, fibronectin was adsorbed to chitosan. The chitosan was further modified by covalently linking heparin using genipin, which then served as a linker to immobilize fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), creating a multifunctional film. Fetal rat neural precursors plated onto this multifunctional film proliferated and remained multipotent for at least 3 days without providing soluble FGF-2. Moreover, they remained less mature and more highly proliferative than cells maintained on fibronectin-coated substrates in culture medium supplemented with soluble FGF-2. To create a vehicle for cell transplantation, a 3% chitosan solution was electrosprayed into a coagulation bath to generate microspheres (range 30-100 mu m, mean 64 mu m) that were subsequently modified. Radial glial cells seeded onto these multifunctional microspheres proliferated for at least 7 days in culture and the microspheres containing cells were small enough to be injected, using 23 Gauge Hamilton syringes, into the brains of adult rats that had previously sustained cortical contusion injuries. When analysed 3 days later, the transplanted RGCs were positive for the stem cell/progenitor marker Nestin.

These patients with polytrauma pose unique challenges to clinicians. The current review evaluates existing guidelines and updates the evidence for prehospital transport, immobilization, initial resuscitation, critical care, hemodynamic stability, diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, and timing appropriate for the patient with SCI who has multisystem trauma. Initial management should be systematic, with focus on spinal immobilization, timely transport, and optimizing perfusion to the spinal cord. There is general evidence for the maintenance of mean arterial pressure of > 85 mm Hg during immediate and acute care to optimize neurological outcome; however, the selection of vasopressor type and duration should be judicious, with considerations for level of injury and risks of increased cardiogenic complications in the elderly. Level II recommendations exist for early decompression, and additional time points of neurological assessment within the first 24 hours and during acute care are warranted to determine the temporality of benefits attributable to early surgery. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended by current guidelines for SCI. For these patients, titration of tidal volumes is important to balance the association of earlier weaning off the ventilator, with its risk of atelectasis, against the risk for lung damage from mechanical overinflation that can occur with prolonged ventilation. Careful evaluation of infection risk is a priority following multisystem trauma for patients with relative immunosuppression or compromise. Although patients with polytrauma may experience longer rehabilitation courses, long-term neurological recovery is generally comparable to that in patients with isolated SCI after controlling for demographics. Bowel and bladder disorders are common following SCI, significantly reduce quality of life, and constitute a focus of targeted therapies.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the endothelial response to anoxia to determine whether recovery of fibrinolytic potential occurs in patients subjected to forced bedrest because of a spinal cord injury and whether this recovery is related to the incidence and/or evolution of DVT. We evaluated vascular endothelium reactivity in the lower limbs no longer submitted to the hydrostatic pressure of the erected position in 15 patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia and in 10 normal volunteers after venous occlusion produced by the application of 10 cm Hg pressure to the lower limb for 15 min comparatively to the upper limb used as reference. Among the 15 patients, 10 whose spinal cord injury had occurred 1 to 6 months earlier were still receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, whereas the five other patients were not receiving prophylactic anticoagulants because the injury dated back 6 months or more. After venostasis, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) increased significantly in both patients and controls in the upper limb (tPA levels twofold and threefold respectively in controls and patients) but showed no significant changes in the lower limb; prolonged immobility did not allow recovery in the lower limbs of a level of fibrinolytic responsiveness identical to that in the upper limbs. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI(1)) remained unchanged after anoxia, although wide interindividual variations were seen. Natural coagulation inhibitors and circulating blood stigmates of hypercoagulability were measured.

Clinical management in the acute setting needs to occur in the intensive care unit in order to identify, prevent, and treat secondary insults from local ischemia, hypotension, hypoxia, and inflammation. Maintenance of adequate perfusion and oxygenation is quintessential and a mean arterial pressure >85-90 mm Hg should be kept for at least 1 week. A cervical collar and full spinal precautions (log-roll, flat, holding C-spine) should be maintained until the spinal column has been fully evaluated by a spine surgeon. In patients with SCI, there is a high incidence of other bodily injuries, and there should be a low threshold to assess for visceral, pelvic, and long bone injuries. Computed tomography of the spine is superior to plain films, as the former rarely misses fractures, though caution needs to be exerted as occipitocervical dislocation can still be missed. To reliably assess the spinal neural elements, soft tissues, and ligamentous structures, magnetic resonance imaging is indicated and should be obtained within 48-72 h from the time of injury. All patients should be graded daily using the American Spinal Injury Association classification, with the first prognostic score at 72 h postinjury. Patients with high cervical cord (C4 or higher) injury should be intubated immediately, and those with lower cord injuries should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, in the acute setting, respiratory mechanics will be disrupted with any spinal cord lesion above T11. Steroids have become extremely controversial, and the professional societies for neurosurgery in the United States have given a level 1 statement against their use in all patients. We, therefore, do not advocate for them at this time. With every SCI, a spine surgeon must be consulted to discuss operative vs nonoperative management strategies. Indications for surgery include a partial or progressive neurologic deficit, instability of the spine not allowing for mobilization, correction of a deformity, and prevention of potential neurologic compromise. Measures to prevent pulmonary emboli from deep venous thromboembolisms are necessary: IVC filters are recommended in bedbound patients and low-molecular weight heparins are superior to unfractionated heparin. Robust prevention of pressure ulcers as well as nutritional support should be a mainstay of treatment. Lastly, it is important to note that neurologic recovery is a several-year process. The most recovery occurs in the first year following injury, and therefore aggressive rehabilitation is crucial."

Most approaches have been focused on providing supportive substrates for guiding neurons and overcoming the physical and chemical barriers to healing that arise after SCI. Although collagen has become a promising natural substrate with good compatibility, its low mechanical properties restrict its potential applications. The mechanical properties mainly rely on the composition and pore structure of scaffolds. For the composition of a scaffold, we used heparin sulfate to react with collagen by crosslinking. For the structure, we adopted a three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to fabricate a scaffold with a uniform pore distributions. We observed that the internal structure of the scaffold printed with a 3D bioprinter was regular and porous. We also found that both the compression modulus and strengths of the scaffold were significantly enhanced by the collagen/heparin sulfate composition compared to a collagen scaffold. Meanwhile, the collagen/heparin sulfate scaffold presented good biocompatibility when it was co-cultured with neural stem cells in vitro. We also demonstrated that heparin sulfate modification significantly improved bFGF immobilization and absorption to the collagen by examining the release kinetics of bFGF from scaffolds. Two months after implantating the scaffold into transection lesions in T10 of the spinal cord in rats, the collagen/heparin sulfate group demonstrated significant recovery of locomotor function and according to electrophysiological examinations. Parallel to functional recovery, collagen/heparin sulfate treatment further ameliorated the pathological process and markedly increased the number of neurofilament (NF) positive cells compared to collagen treatment alone. These data suggested that a collagen/heparin sulfate scaffold fabricated by a 3D bioprinter could enhance the mechanical properties of collagen and provide continuous guidance channels for axons, which would improve the neurological function after SCI.

Nanofiber scaffolds represent a potential class of materials for enhancing nerve regeneration because of its biomimicking architecture. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of incorporating neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) onto electrospun collagen nanofibers for SCI treatment. By using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) mediated crosslinking, proteins were loaded onto electrospun collagen nanofibers at an efficiency of similar to 45-48%. By combining NT-3 with heparin during the protein incorporation process, a sustained release of NT-3 was obtained (similar to 96% by day 28). As indicated by dorsal root ganglion outgrowth assay, NT-3 incorporated collagen scaffolds supported neuronal culture and neurite outgrowth for a longer time period than bolus delivery of NT-3. The presence of heparin also protected ChABC from degradation. Specifically, as evaluated by dimethylmethylene blue assay, bioactive ChABC was detected from collagen scaffolds for at least 32 days in vitro in the presence of heparin (similar to 32% of bioactivity retained). In contrast, ChABC bioactivity was only similar to 1.9% by day 22 in the absence of heparin. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating NT-3 and ChABC via mTG immobilization to produce protein-incorporated collagen nanofibers. Such biofunctional nanofiber constructs may find useful applications in SCI treatment by providing topographical signals and multiple biochemical cues that can promote nerve regeneration while antagonizing axonal growth inhibition for CNS regeneration.

A heparin-based delivery system (HBDS) was used to immobilize NT-3 within fibrin scaffolds via non-covalent interactions. The fibrin scaffolds were implanted in lesions immediately after injury in an adult rat model of SCI (complete ablation of a 2 min segment of the cord at T9). Delivery of NT-3 was controlled by an affinity-based delivery system that limits drug loss by diffusion and releases the drug via cell-mediated processes. Twelve weeks after injury and treatment, animals treated with fibrin scaffolds and NT-3, with or without the delivery system, did not show functional improvement over saline controls. Substantial cavitation at edges of the lesion was present, and while neuronal fibers were present inside the lesion, traced corticospinal and dorsal sensory tracts did not regenerate into the lesion. Therefore, while previous studies indicate that the controlled delivery of NT-3 from fibrin scaffolds may increase the short term regenerative response, the continued degeneration of the cord, indicative of the severity of the injury, limits the long term regeneration stimulated by this treatment. Chronic or repeated treatments or a less severe injury model may prove useful in assessing the utility of controlled delivery systems for the treatment of spinal cord injury. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the time course of expression of PTN, MK and FGF-2 during EAE and determined the cellular origin of FGF-2 and FGFR1 in normal spinal cord and during inflammatory demyelination. Basal expression of PTN and MK mRNAs in normal spinal cords was significantly upregulated after induction of EAE. MK expression was upregulated two to threefold correlating with disease progression, whereas PTN expression reached peak levels threefold above basal levels during the clinical recovery period. FGF-2 mRNA expression was low in normal spinal cord and dramatically increased in correlation with progressive demyelination. FGF-2 was confined to neurons in normal tissue and shifted dramatically to microglia, paralleling their activation during EAE. Double immunohistochemistry revealed colocalization of FGF-2 to activated microglia/macrophages with strongest expression in the macrophage-rich perivascular core area and microglial expression at the edges of white and gray matter perivascular regions. FGFR1, like its ligand, was induced in activated macrophages/microglia. Growth factor expression in demyelinating diseases could serve several functions, e.g., to modulate the activity of microglia/macrophage in an autocrine fashion, to induce the expression of other factors like insulin-like growth factor 1 or plasminogen activator, which can effect regeneration or degeneration, respectively, and finally to stimulate directly localized proliferation and/or regeneration of oligodendrocytes within the lesion area.

We have previously demonstrated that contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) increases the levels of mRNA for basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). To determine whether FGF2 protein levels also increase, Western blot analysis was performed on extracts of spinal cord tissue after a standardized SCI and compared to laminectomy controls, In spinal cord extracts, a monoclonal antibody to FGF2 recognized various molecular forms of FGF2 (18-24 kDa) and some characteristic proteolytic fragments. Extracts of spinal cords 1 day after SCI showed a slight increase in the levels of these polypeptides. By 4 days, a significant increase (twofold) was detected ill the levels of the 18-kDa and higher molecular weight forms as well as the proteolytic fragments. Immunohistochemical analyses on spinal cord tissue sections confirmed an increased cellular (glial) FGF2 as well as interstitial immunoreactivity surrounding neurons and along blood vessels. Heparin-purified spinal cord extracts from tissue 4 days after SCI showed increased biological activity as indicated by their ability to (i) increase [H-3]thymidine incorporation in cultures of Balb/c 3T3 cells and (ii) induce phosphorylation of suc-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target, a FGF2 target protein. These data suggest that SCI induces increased FGF2 expression and support the hypothesis that FGF2 may play a role in the partial recovery of function seen following SCI.

The injured spinal cords were evaluated for morphological differences using markers for neurons, astrocytes, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans 2 weeks after treatment. The addition of 500 ng/mL of NT-3 with the delivery system resulted in an increase in neural fiber density compared to fibrin alone.

In this review, the authors summarize the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system as well as the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of major cardiovascular complications that can occur following acute (up to 30 days) traumatic SCI. Hypotension (both supine and orthostatic), autonomic dysreflexia, and cardiac arrhythmias (including persistent bradycardia) are attributed to the loss of supraspinal control of the sympathetic nervous system that commonly occurs in patients with severe spinal cord lesions at T-6 or higher. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend: 1) monitoring of cardiac and hemodynamic parameters in the acute phase of SCI; 2) maintenance of a minimum mean arterial blood pressure of 85 mm Hg during the hyperacute phase (1 week after SCI); 3) timely detection and appropriate treatment of neurogenic shock and cardiac arrhythmias; and 4) immediate and adequate treatment of episodes of acute autonomic dysreflexia. In addition to these forms of cardiovascular dysfunction, individuals with acute SCIs are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to loss of mobility and, potentially, altered fibrinolytic activity, abnormal platelet function, and impaired circadian variations of hemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters. Current evidence supports a recommendation for thromboprophylaxis using mechanical methods and anticoagulants during the acute stage up to 3 months following SCI, depending on the severity and level of injury. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the first choice for anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend (or refute) the use of screening tests for DVT in asymptomatic adults with acute SCI, this strategy may detect asymptomatic DVT in at least 9.4% of individuals who undergo thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin. Indications and treatment of DVT and acute pulmonary embolism are well established and are summarized in this review. Recognition of cardiovascular complications after acute SCI is essential to minimize adverse outcomes and to optimize recovery. (DOI: 10.3171/FOC.2008.25.11.E13)"

In order to achieve prolonged release of bioactive protein, an affinity-based approach was designed which exploits the specific binding of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain with short proline-rich peptides. Specifically, methyl cellulose was modified with SH3-binding peptides (MC-peptide) with either a weak affinity or strong affinity for SH3. The release profile of SH3-rhFGF2 fusion protein from hyaluronan MC-SH3 peptide (HAMC-peptide) hydrogels was investigated and compared to unmodified controls. SH3-rhFGF2 release from HAMC-peptide was extended to 10 days using peptides with different binding affinities compared to the 48 h release from unmodified HAMC. This system is capable of delivering additional proteins with tunable rates of release, while maintaining bioactivity, and thus is broadly applicable."

Little is currently known about the molecular basis for such recovery, but the increased trophic activity in injured CNS tissue and the known properties of neurotrophic factors in neuronal growth and maintenance suggest that these polypeptides are probably involved in recovery of function. Members of the neurotrophin family, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), are capable of supporting survival of injured CNS neurons both in vitro and in vivo. They also stimulate neurite outgrowth, needed for reorganization of the injured CNS, and the expression of key enzymes for neurotransmitter synthesis that may need to be upregulated to compensate for reduced innervation. The effects of the neurotrophins are mediated through specific high affinity trk receptors (trk A, B, C) as well as a common low affinity receptor designated p75(NGFR). Another class of neurotrophic polypeptides also provides candidate recovery-promoting molecules, the heparin-binding growth factors' acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, bFGF). FGFs not only sustain survival of injured neurons but also stimulate revascularization and certain glial responses to injury. Both the neurotrophins and the FGFs, as well as their respective receptors, have been shown to be upregulated after experimental CNS injury. Further, administration of neurotrophins or FGF has been shown to reduce the effects of experimental injury induced by axotomy, excitotoxins, and certain other neurotoxins. The cellular basis for the potential therapeutic use of neurotrophic molecules is discussed as well as new strategies to increase neurotrophic activity after CNS trauma based on the recently obtained information on pharmacological and molecular control of the expression of these genes."

A heparin-based delivery system (HBDS) was used to immobilize NT-3 within fibrin gels via non-covalent interactions to slow diffusion-based release of NT-3, thus allowing cell-activated degradation of fibrin to mediate release. The HBDS consists of three components: immobilized linker peptide, heparin and NT-3. The linker peptide contained a Factor XIIIa substrate and was covalently cross-linked to fibrin during polymerization. This immobilized linker peptide sequesters heparin within fibrin gels, and sequestered heparin binds NT-3, preventing its diffusion. Mathematical modeling was performed to examine the effect of heparin concentration on the fraction of NT-3 initially bound to fibrin. In vitro release studies confirmed that heparin concentration modulates diffusion-based release of NT-3. Fibrin gels containing the HBDS and NT-3 stimulated neural outgrowth from chick dorsal root ganglia by up to 54% versus unmodified fibrin, demonstrating that the NT-3 released is biologically active. In a preliminary in vivo study, fibrin gels containing the HBDS and NT-3 showed increased neural fiber density in spinal cord lesions versus unmodified fibrin at 9 days. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

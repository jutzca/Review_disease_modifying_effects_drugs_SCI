Preventing cell death by improving endogenous regenerative capability could an effective strategy for the treatment of SCI. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) on the cell survival through overexpression of BDNF and NT3 mRNA level and their receptors in the contusion rat models. Methods: Rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups (eight rats/group) including: contused animals (the non-treatment group); contused animals (the control group) which received laminectomy; contused animals received normal saline (vehicle)and contused animals received intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg LiCl three days after surgery. Injection continued for 14 days as treatment. Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale was used to assess the motor function of the rats. To evaluate the histopathological and gene expression analysis, rats were sacrificed 28 days after surgery. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to obtain the relative levels of mRNA for BDNF, NT3 and their receptors. Results: The results showed LiCl ameliorates BBB scores via up-regulation of BDNF and TrkB receptors. Also, histological analysis showed that the numerical density per area of TUNEL- positive cells and the percentage of cavity significantly decreased in the LiCl-treated group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that LiCl protects neural cells and effectively enhances locomotor function, which was done through up-regulation of endogenous BDNF expression in rats with SCI."

In the present study, the protective effect of combination treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and lithium chloride against hydrocephalus after IVH was investigated. A total of 130 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups, including the IVH control, G-CSF treatment, lithium chloride treatment, combination treatment and sham surgery groups. An IVH rat model was established in order to examine the effect of combination treatment on hydrocephalus incidence. A TUNEL assay was performed to detect neuronal apoptosis in the five groups. In addition, the protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were detected by western blot analysis. The differentiation of nerve cells in the brain tissue obtained from the five rat groups was also determined with double immunofluorescence staining. The results demonstrated that administration of G-CSF or lithium chloride alone was able to only partly relieve the incidence of hydrocephalus after IVH. By contrast, combination treatment with G-CSF and lithium chloride significantly attenuated the development of hydrocephalus following IVH. TUNEL assay showed that neuronal apoptosis was significantly reduced by the combination treatment with G-CSF and lithium chloride. Furthermore, the expression of Bcl-2 was upregulated, whereas Bax expression was downregulated in the combination treatment group. The results also detected the highest expression of BrdU/GFAP, BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/PSA-NCAM in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, the combination of endogenous neural stem cell mobilization (using G-CSF) and lithium chloride treatment resulted in highly reduced incidence of hydrocephalus after IVH by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis."

The main objective of this study is to ascertain whether combinational therapy of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) together with lithium chloride improves cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in a rat spinal contusion model, or not. Contusive spinal cord injury was implemented on Wistar male rats. Experimental groups comprised of: control, hNSCs transplanted, lithium chloride (Li), and hNSCs and lithium chloride (hNSCs+Li). In every experimental group, locomotor activity score and motor evoked potential (MEP) were performed to evaluate motor recovery as well as histological assessments to determine mechanisms of improvement. In accordance with our results, the hNSCs+Li and the Li groups showed significant improvement in locomotor scores and MEP. Also, Histological assessments revealed that transplanted hNSCs are capable of differentiation and migration along the spinal cord. Although NESTIN-positive cells were proliferated significantly in the Lithium group in comparison with control and the hNSCs+Li groups, the quantity of ED1 cells in the hNSCs+Li was significantly larger than the other two groups. Our results demonstrate that combinational therapy of hNSCs with lithium chloride and lithium chloride individually are adequate for ameliorating more than partial functional recovery and endogenous repair in spinal cord-injured rats."

Intraperitoneal lithium chloride (80 mg/kg/day for 3 days) significantly improved locomotor function at 8 days post-injury (DPI); this was maintained until 14 DPI (P<0.05). Western blotting showed significantly increased phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta (Ser9), Nrf-2, and the Nrf-2 target HO-1 in the spinal cords of lithium-treated animals. Fewer neuropathological changes (e.g., hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and tissue loss) were observed in the spinal cords of the lithium-treated group compared with the vehicle-treated group. Microglial activation (evaluated by measuring the immunoreactivity of ionized calcium-binding protein-1) was also significantly reduced in the lithium-treated group.

Autophagy is a potential therapeutic target when seeking to protect the BSCB. We explored the effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) on BSCB permeability and autophagy-induced SCI both in a rat model of SCI and in endothelial cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. We evaluated BSCB status using the Evans Blue dye extravasation test and measurement of tight junction (TJ) protein levels; we also assessed functional locomotor recovery. We detected autophagy-associated proteins in vivo and in vitro using both Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found that, in a rat model of SCI, LiCl attenuated the elevation in BSCB permeability, improved locomotor recovery, and inhibited the degradation of TJ proteins including occludin and claudin-5. LiCl significantly induced the extent of autophagic flux after SCI by increasing LC3-II and ATG-5 levels, and abolishing p62 accumulation. In addition, a combination of LiCl and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine not only partially eliminated the BSCB-protective effect of LiCl, but also exacerbated TJ protein degradation both in vivo and in vitro. Together, these findings suggest that LiCl treatment alleviates BSCB disruption and promotes locomotor recovery after SCI, partly by stimulating autophagic flux. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Usually, lithium is used as a popular mood stabilizer. Recently, growing evidence has shown that lithium has clear neuroprotective effects after SCI, and the administration of lithium can effectively improve locomotor recovery. However, the exact neuroprotective mechanism of lithium is still not understood. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the neuroprotective effects of lithium both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we discovered that lithium inhibits GSK3 beta activity through two different signaling pathways in spinal cord neurons. In the acute phase, lithium inhibited GSK3 beta activity by stimulating phosphorylation of AKT; in the chronic phase, we first discovered that lithium additionally upregulated the expression of Na+, K+-ATPase alpha 1 (NKA alpha 1), which had an inhibitory effect on GSK3 beta activity by inducing the expression of glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 is well known as a regulator of the GSK3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, the suppressed activity of GSK3 beta increased the level of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm, which gave rise to the translocation of the freely stabilized beta-catenin to the nucleus. In addition, the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus had the benefits of neuronal survival. Hopefully our findings from this study are beneficial in revealing the neuroprotective mechanism of lithium and in offering novel targets for the development of new SCI therapeutic drugs."

We injected NSCs into tibial nerve and transplanted tibial nerve into a hemisected spinal cord and investigated the effects of lithium chloride (LiCI) on the survival of spinal neurons, axonal regeneration, and functional recovery. Our results show that most of the transplanted NSCs expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, while there was no obvious expression of nestin, neuronal nuclei, or acetyltransferase found in NSCs. LiCI treatment produced less macrosialin (EDI) expression and axonal degeneration in tibial nerve after NSC injection. Our results also show that a regimen of LiCI treatment promoted NSC differentiation into NF200-positive neurons with neurite extension into the host spinal cord. The combination of tibial nerve transplantation with NSCs and LiCI injection resulted in more host motoneurons surviving in the spinal cord, more regenerated axons in tibial nerve, less glial scar area, and decreased ED I expression. We conclude that lithium may have therapeutic potential in cell replacement strategies for central nervous system injury due to its ability to promote survival and neuronal generation of grafted NSCs and reduced host immune reaction."

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of EA therapy on Wnt/beta-catenin-regulated gene expression and neuronal recovery in rats with SCI. The Allen method was used to establish SCI in rats, and alterations in Wnt1 and Nestin mRNA and protein expression levels in response to SCI were determined on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-injury using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. To evaluate the effects of EA treatment on SCI, the following four treatment groups were employed: SCI, SCI + EA, SCI + lithium chloride (LiCl) and SCI + LiCl + EA. The protein expression levels of Wnt1, Nestin and nuclear beta-catenin were evaluated on day 3 post-treatment, and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) protein expression levels were evaluated on day 21 post-treatment using western blot analysis. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scoring method was used to evaluate spinal cord recovery on day 28 post-treatment across the four treatment groups. EA therapy at the Dazhui and Mingmen acupuncture points significantly increased the expression levels of Wnt1, Nestin, beta-catenin and NeuN, thus suggesting that EA therapy may promote spinal cord recovery following injury. The underlying mechanism was demonstrated to involve enhanced Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which may promote the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. However, further studies are required to elucidate the detailed effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of EA therapy on SCI."

In the lithium and 3-MA groups, rats were intraperitoneally injected with lithium (LiCl; 30 mg/kg) 6 hours after SCI and thereafter once daily until sacrifice. At 2, 3 and 4 weeks after SCI, neurological function and diffusion tensor imaging indicators were remarkably improved in the lithium group compared with the SCI and 3-MA groups.

Immunohistochemical staining showed that immunoreactivities for Beclin-1 and light-chain 3B peaked 1 day after SCI in the lithium and SCI groups. Immunoreactivities for Beclin-1 and light-chain 3B were weaker in the 3-MA group than in the SCI group, indicating that 3-MA inhibits lithium-induced autophagy. Furthermore, NeuN(+) neurons were more numerous in the lithium group than in the SCI and 3-MA groups, with the fewest in the latter. Our findings show that lithium reduces neuronal damage after acute SCI and promotes neurological recovery by inducing autophagy.

The effect of a GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl), on the regeneration of axotomized RST neurons was also assessed. Adult rats received a unilateral hemisection at the seventh cervical spinal cord segment (C7). Four weeks after different treatments, regeneration of RST axons across the lesion scar was examined by injection of Fluoro-Gold at spinal segment T2, and locomotor recovery was studied by a test of forelimb usage. Injured RST axons did not regenerate spontaneously after spinal cord injury, and intraperitoneal injection of LiCl alone did not promote the regeneration of RST axons. Administration of ChABC at the lesion site enhanced the regeneration of RST axons by 20%. Combined treatment of LiCl together with ChABC significantly increased the regeneration of RST axons to 42%. Animals receiving combined treatment used both forelimbs together more often than animals that received sham or single treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LiCl induced the expression of inactive GSK-3beta as well as the upregulation of Bcl-2 in injured RST neurons. These results indicate that in vivo, LiCl inhibits GSK-3beta and reinforces the regeneration-promoting function of ChABC through a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism. Combined use of LiCl together with ChABC could be a novel treatment for spinal cord injury."

The failure of axonal elongation is principally attributed to the nonpermissive environment and reduced intrinsic growth capacity. In this report, we studied the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inactivation on neurite and axon growth from adult neurons via combined in vitro and in vivo approaches. We found that the major CNS inhibiting substrates including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans could inactivate protein kinase B (Akt) and activate GSK-3 beta signals in neurons. GSK-3 inactivation with pharmacologic inhibitors enhances neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons derived from adult mice or cerebellar granule neurons from postnatal rodents cultured on CNS inhibitors. Application of GSK-3 inhibitors stimulates axon formation and elongation of mature neurons whether in presence or absence of inhibitory substrates. Systemic application of the GSK-3 inhibitor lithium to spinal cord-lesioned rats suppresses the activity of this kinase around lesion. Treatments with GSK-3 inhibitors including a clinical dose of lithium to rats with thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injuries induce significant descending corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery. Our studies suggest that GSK-3 signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting functional recovery of adult CNS injuries and that administration of GSK-3 inhibitors may facilitate the development of an effective treatment to white matter injuries including spinal cord trauma given the wide use of lithium in humans."

Specifically, in the case of spinal injuries, these factors can stimulate neuronal recovery. They are applied both in experimental models and in clinical trials in patients. The trophic factors analysed in this review include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), growth hormone (GH), melatonin, oestrogens, the family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), the family of neurotrophins and the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). There are some trophic (neurotrophic) factors that already been tested in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), but only shown partial recovery effect. It is possible that, the administration of these trophic factors together with physical rehabilitation, act synergistically and, therefore, significantly improve the quality of life of patients with SCI."

However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of MT on SCI have not been elucidated. An experiment was performed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of MT on the neuronal autophagy after SCI and its effect on the recovery of nerve function. The rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: the SCI+MT+EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor), SCI+MT, SCI, and sham operation groups. On the 14th day after SCI, MT significantly promoted the recovery of motor function in the hind limbs according to the results of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores. At the same time, MT treatment resulted in reduced activation of cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive neurons and increased the survival of motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord on the 14th day after SCI, which exerted its neuroprotection. Furthermore, western blot and immunofluorescence double staining were performed to verify the molecular mechanism of effect of MT on SCI, and results showed the significantly upregulated expressions of Beclin-1, light chain-3B, SIRT1, p-AMPK proteins in the spinal cord tissue of MT-treated rats on the 14th day after SCI, however, the effect of MT on autophagy was reversed by EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor), which implied that MT activated autophagy via SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway after SCI. Similarly, the neuroprotective effects of MT on SCI were also inhibited after the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway was suppressed by EX527. Taken together, these results suggest that MT inhibits the apoptosis and activates autophagy of nerve cells after SCI and ultimately exerts the neuroprotective effect by SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway."

The effects of frostbite on the skin have been extensively studied and many drugs for its treatment have been tested over the years. The effects of melatonin in the treatment of tissue injuries have also been investigated. The present study was performed to examine the effects of melatonin on frostbite of the skin. Material and Methods: This study was performed in 2006 in the Anatomy Department of Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine. Ears of five rabbits were used in each group and specimens were taken by punch biopsy. Groups were allocated as follows: Control group: rabbit ears with no induced injury or treatment; Trauma group: rabbit ears subjected to cold injury; Treatment group: rabbit ears treated with melatonin after cold injury; and Sham group: rabbit ears treated with 0.9% NaCl after cold injury. Specimens were evaluated by transmission electron microscope and were scored statistically. Results: In the trauma group, the cells of the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis had separated. Intro-cytoplasmic edema and vacuoles in these cells were visible. Although there was loss of chromatin and evident edema in the nucleus of some of these cells, there was no clear defect in the distribution of the nuclear chromatin in general. Separation between the cells of the stratum corneum of the melatonin group was absent. The cells were normal, collagen fibers were regular and the fibroblasts were inactive. Conclusion: The results obtained in this rabbit model are significant for suggesting the favorable effects of melatonin on cold injury."

In this study, MT's effects on the accumulation and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes and their related inflammatory response were investigated in an acute SCI model. The effects of MT on oxidative stress, neuronal survival and behavioral performance were also tested. It was found that MT treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation and the proliferation of microglia and astrocytes. Quantitative PCR data showed that MT significantly down-regulated the pro-inflammatory markers iNOS, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha expressions. The data showed that MT led to the rise in SOD, CAT and GSH-Px contents and the decrease in MDA content. Western blotting analysis verified that MT significantly down-regulated caspase-3, Bax and GFAP expressions, up-regulated Bcl-2 expression. Compared with the SCI vehicle-treated group, the SCI MT-treated group exhibited a greater Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) locomotor rating score. On the whole, these findings implied that MT exerts its neuroprotective effects by suppressing the accumulation and the proliferation of microglia and astrocytes and reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which might be one of the underlying mechanisms of the MT's neuroprotective effect after SCI. Accordingly, MT may be a promising therapeutic candidate for acute SCI."

Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (12 animals in each group): sham, SCI, and melatonin groups. Melatonin (50 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at 30 min after a moderate injury at T10 in the melatonin group (twice a day). At 24 h postinjury, spinal cord perfusion was estimated using laser Doppler flowmetry, the permeability of BSCB was detected by Evan's blue, and edema was estimated by calculating the water content. A linear regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation between spinal cord perfusion and the permeability of BSCB or water content. Our results showed that melatonin significantly upregulated spinal cord blood flow and oxygen saturation in SCI rats using laser Doppler perfusion monitoring. Simultaneously, laser Doppler perfusion imaging indicated that melatonin markedly meliorated spinal cord perfusion in regions rostral and caudal to the injury site, rather than the epicenter site. Consistent with the results of laser Doppler flowmetry, melatonin significantly reduced the amount of Evan's blue dye and water content in regions of rostral and caudal cords. In addition, perfusion correlated with the permeability of BSCB and water content. These findings indicated that melatonin might exert a protective effect by meliorating microcirculation, which coordinated a corresponding response in the integrity of BSCB and edema.

Here, we explore the potential proliferative and neuroprotective mechanism of melatonin on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). NSCs were induced from iPSCs, then pretreated with 500 mu M H2O2, 1 mu M melatonin, 1 mu M melatonin receptor antagonist (Luzindole), or 10 mu M Phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002). The results showed that melatonin stimulated proliferation of iPSC-derived NSCs on H2O2 exposure. Melatonin also markedly improved stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the rate of apoptosis. Treatment with Luzindole or LY294002 inhibited the increasing proliferative and neuroprotective effects of melatonin on iPSC-derived NSCs with H2O2 treatment. Our results further demonstrated that these promotional effects of melatonin were related with the activity of phosphorylation of AKT. Therefore, these outcomes propose that melatonin protects iPSC-derived NSCs from H2O2-induced injury through the mediation of melatonin receptor and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway."

Melatonin (MT) has been shown to have good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Chondroitin sulfate ABC (ChABC) has been shown to metabolize chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and can reduce colloidal scar formation. However, the effect of any of these drugs alone in the recovery of nerve function after injury is not completely satisfactory. Therefore, this experiment aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of combined application of melatonin and chondroitin sulfate ABC on nerve regeneration and functional recovery after nerve-root avulsion of the brachial plexus. Fifty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and their C5-7 nerve roots were avulsed. Then, the C6 nerve roots were replanted to construct the brachial plexus nerve-root avulsion model. After successful modeling, the injured rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group (injury) did not receive any drug treatment, but was treated with a pure gel-sponge carrier nerve-root implantation and an ethanol-saline solution via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The second group (melatonin) was treated with melatonin via i.p. injection. The third group (chondroitin sulfate ABC) was treated with chondroitin sulfate ABC through local administration. The fourth group (melatonin + chondroitin sulfate ABC) was treated with melatonin through i.p. injection and chondroitin sulfate ABC through local administration. The upper limb Terzis grooming test was used 2-6 weeks after injury to evaluate motor function. Inflammation and oxidative damage within 24 hours of injury were evaluated by spectrophotometry. Immunofluorescence and neuroelectrophysiology were used to evaluate glial scar, neuronal protection, and nerve regeneration. The results showed that the Terzis grooming-test scores of the three groups that received treatment were better than those of the injury only group. Additionally, these three groups showed lower levels of C5-7 intramedullary peroxidase and malondialdehyde. Further, glial scar tissue in the C6 spinal segment was smaller and the number of motor neurons was greater. The endplate area of the biceps muscle was larger and the structure was clear. The latency of the compound potential of the myocutaneous nerve-biceps muscle was shorter. All these indexes were even greater in the melatonin + chondroitin sulfate ABC group than in the melatonin only or chondroitin sulfate ABC only groups. Thus, the results showed that melatonin combined with chondroitin sulfate ABC can promote nerve regeneration after nerve-root avulsion injury of the brachial plexus, which may be achieved by reducing oxidative damage and inflammatory reaction in the injury area and inhibiting glial scar formation."

Controlled light/dark cycle was pre-applied 2 weeks before induction of spinal cord injury. There was a significant increase in motor recovery as well as body weight from postoperative day (POD) 7 under constant darkness. However, spontaneous elevation of endogenous melatonin in cerebrospinal fluid was seen at POD 3 in all of the SCI rats, which was enhanced in SCI + DD group. Augmented melatonin concentration under constant dark condition resulted in facilitation of neuronal differentiation as well as inhibition of primary cell death. In the rostrocaudal region, elevated endogenous melatonin concentration promoted neural remodeling in acute phase including oligodendrogenesis, excitatory synaptic formation, and axonal outgrowth. The changes were mediated via NAS-TrkB-AKT/ERK signal transduction co-regulated by the circadian clock mechanism, leading to rapid motor recovery. In contrast, exposure to constant light exacerbated the inflammatory responses and neuroglial loss. These results suggest that light/dark control in the acute phase might be a considerable environmental factor for a favorable prognosis after SCI."

Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats received moderate thoracic (T)-9 contusion SCI (or sham surgery). First, SCI disrupted diurnal rhythms in two metabolic behaviors: fecal production and food intake rhythms were ablated acutely. SCI also expedited whole-gut transit time. In parallel, acute SCI increased plasma glucose. Diurnal glucose storage-release cycles regulated by the liver were disrupted by SCI, which also increased liver glucose metabolism messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Further, SCI disrupted liver clock gene expression and suppressed inflammatory gene rhythms. Together, our novel data suggest that SCI disrupts typical metabolic and circadian function. Improving post-SCI metabolic function could enhance recovery of homeostasis."

In this study, we showed that daily intraperitoneal injection with melatonin following spinal cord contusion at thoracic level 10 in mice improved intestinal barrier integrity and GI motility, reduced expression levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, improved animal weight gain and metabolic profiling, and promoted locomotor recovery. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed that melatonin treatment decreased the Shannon index and reshaped the composition of intestinal microbiota. Melatonin-treated SCI animals showed decreased relative abundance of Clostridiales and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillales and Lactobacillus, which correlated with alteration of cytokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) expression and GI barrier permeability, as well as with locomotor recovery. Experimental induction of gut dysbiosis in mice before SCI (i.e., by oral delivery of broad-spectrum antibiotics) exacerbates neurological impairment after SCI, and melatonin treatment improves locomotor performance and intestinal integrity in antibiotic-treated SCI mice.

Microglial/macrophages polarization plays an important role in regulating immune responses. To examine whether melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects after acute SCI by regulating microglial/macrophages polarization in the spinal cord, we administered intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (50 mg/kg) in female rats immediately after SCI and then daily for seven consecutive days (n = 6). Compared with the vehicle-treated group (n = 6), the melatonin-treated group exhibited a greater Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating score, smaller spinal cavity, and less cleaved caspase 3 immunofluorescence staining in the injured spinal segments. Realtime PCR data revealed decreases in the expression levels of M1 microglia phenotypic markers and increases in M2 markers in the spinal cord of melatonin-treated SCI rats, as compared to levels in the vehicle-treated group. Melatonin increased the number of CD206(+) and Arg1(+) cells, decreased the number of CD16(+) and iNOS(+) cells and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta) in the spinal cord tissue of female SCI rats.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of MT in the treatment of SCI. Methods Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scaling was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MT on post-SCI locomotion recovery. In addition, the measurement of spinal cord water content was performed together with Nissl staining to evaluate the protective effect of MT against SCI. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, Western blot analysis, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were also conducted to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of MT in the treatment of SCI. Results BBB scores of SCI + MT rats were increased compared with the BBB scores of SCI rats, thus confirming the beneficial role of MT treatment in post-SCI functional recovery. Meanwhile, the administration of MT could alleviate SCI by reducing spinal cord water content and by exerting a neuroprotective effect on motor neurons. Furthermore, in the treatment of SCI, MT also attenuated cell apoptosis. Moreover, the relative expression of NLRP3, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and caspase-1 were markedly elevated in the SCI group compared with that in the sham group, while the administration of MT reduced the expression of NLRP3 in SCI rats. Conclusions MT treatment accelerated the recovery of SCI by suppressing the activation of inflammasomes."

An increasing number of preclinical studies suggest that melatonin may be useful for the treatment of SCI. Melatonin is an indolamine that is primarily secreted by the pineal gland and known to be regulated by photoperiodicity. However, it is also a versatile hormone with antioxidative, antiapoptotic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we review the neuroprotective properties of melatonin and the potential mechanisms by which it might be beneficial in the treatment of SCI. We also describe therapies that combine melatonin with exercise, oxytetracycline, and dexamethasone to attenuate the secondary injury after SCI and limit potential side effects.

Melatonin (MT), a hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, is associated with neuroprotective effects against SCI. Enhanced autophagy can promote the recovery of locomotor function and reduce apoptosis after SCI. Interestingly, MT increases autophagy in SCI in vivo. Nevertheless, the ability of MT to increase autophagy and decrease apoptosis, and the potential effects on the recovery of motor neurons in the anterior horn after SCI remain to be clarified. In this study, we discovered that MT treatment improved motor function recovery in a rat SCI model. Indeed, MT upregulated the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), while expression of protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was downregulated after SCI. Additionally, MT increased the expression of autophagy-activating proteins, while the expression of apoptosis-activating proteins in neurons was decreased following SCI. Furthermore, autophagy was inhibited, while apoptosis was induced in SCI model rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary neurons by treatment with MT, the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa). Collectively, our results suggest that MT can improve the recovery of locomotor function by enhancing autophagy as well as reducing apoptosis after SCI in rats, probably via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."

In this study, we demonstrated that melatonin exhibited neuroprotective effects on neuronal apoptosis and supported functional recovery in a rat SCI model by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. We found that melatonin administration after SCI significantly upregulated the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 phosphorylation (p-LRP-6), lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1) and beta-catenin protein in the spinal cord. Melatonin enhanced motor neuronal survival in the spinal cord ventral horn and improved the locomotor functions of rats after SCI. Melatonin administration after SCI also reduced the expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in the spinal cord and the proportion of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells, but increased the expression level of Bcl-2.

In this study, the amniotic epithelial cells ( AECs) were isolated from bovine amnion and incubated with various melatonin concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 m) and 5 x 10(-5) m all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for screening optimum culture medium of neural differentiation, compared with each groups, 1 m melatonin and 5 x 10(-5) m RA were selected to induce neural differentiation of AECs, and then siMT1, siMT2, oWnt-4, and siWnt-4 were expressed in AECs to research role of these genes in neural differentiation. Efficiency of neural differentiation was evaluated after expressed above genes using flow cytometry. Cell function of neural cells was demonstrated in vivo using spinal cord injury model after cell transplantation, and damage repair of spinal cord was assessed using cell tracking and Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale scores. Results demonstrated that melatonin stimulated melatonin receptor 1, which subsequently increased bovine amniotic epithelial cell vitality and promoted differentiation into neural cells. This took place through cooperation with Wnt-4. Additionally, following cotreatment with melatonin and Wnt-4, neurogenesis gene expression was significantly altered. Furthermore, single inhibition of melatonin receptor 1 or Wnt-4 expression decreased expression of neurogenesis-related genes, and bovine amniotic epithelial cell-derived neural cells were successfully colonized into injured spinal cord, which suggested participation in tissue repair."

Unfortunately, we still do not have suitable therapeutic agents for treatment of SCI and prevention of its devastating consequences. However, we have gained a good understanding of pathological mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration leading to paralysis or even death following SCI. Primary injury to the spinal cord initiates the secondary injury process that includes various deleterious factors for ultimate activation of different cysteine proteases for degradation of cellular key cytoskeleton and other crucial proteins for delayed death of neurons and glial cells at the site of SCI and its penumbra in different animal models. An important aspect of SCI is the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration within a short time of primary injury. Various studies in different laboratories demonstrate that the most important cysteine protease for neurodegeneration in SCI is calpain, which absolutely requires intracellular free Ca2+ for its activation. Furthermore, other cysteine proteases, such as caspases and cathepsin B also make a contribution to neurodegeneration in SCI. Therefore, inhibition of cysteine proteases is an important goal in prevention of neurodegeneration in SCI. Studies showed that individual inhibitors of cysteine proteases provided significant neuroprotection in animal models of SCI. Recent studies suggest that physiological hormones, such as estrogen and melatonin, can be successfully used for prevention of neurodegeneration and preservation of motor function in acute SCI as well as in chronic SCI in rats."

After 4 h SCI, all animals in control or DNT-treated groups became paraparesic. Significant improvement was observed in DNT-treated group, 24 h after SCI, with respect to control. Traumatic SCI led to an increase in the lipid peroxidation and a decrease in enzymic or non-enzymic endogenous antioxidative defense systems, and increase in apoptotic cell numbers.

The 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: tadalafil, methylprednisolone, non-treatment and sham groups. Rats were neurologically tested at 24 hours after trauma. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p < 0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p < 0.05). The increase in serum SOD levels was greater in the tadalafil group than the methylprednisolone group. Serum MDA levels in the tadalafll and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group (p > 0.05). Tissue MDA levels in the taclalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group and sham groups (p > 0.05). Although there was no difference in neurological outcome scores between the taclalafil, methylprednisolone and non-treatment groups (p > 0.05), the animals in the taclalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to have better Scores than the non-treatment group. Thus, tadalafil appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of injury to the spinal cord by increasing tissue levels of NO and serum activity of SOD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Melatonin, known as a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have an effect on lipid peroxidation following experimental SCI. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of MP and melatonin on neurological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological recovery. Female albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into five groups of 18 rats each and six rats for the control group. Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of NIP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action."

Subsequent to SCI in humans, many individuals have residual motor and sensory deficits that impair functional performance and quality of life. The available treatments for SCI are rehabilitation therapy, activity-based therapies, and pharmacological treatment using antioxidants and their agonists. Among pharmacological treatments, the most efficient and commonly used antioxidant for experimental SCI treatment is melatonin, an indolamine secreted by pineal gland at night. Melatonin's receptor-independent free radical scavenging action and its broad-spectrum antioxidant activity makes it an ideal antioxidant to protect tissue from oxidative stress-induced secondary damage after SCI. Owing to the limitations of an activity-based therapy and antioxidant treatment singly on the functional recovery and oxidative stress-induced secondary damages after SCI, a melatonin plus exercise treatment may be a more effective therapy for SCI. As suggested herein, supplementation with melatonin in conjunction with exercise not only would improve the functional recovery by enhancing the beneficial effects of exercise but would reduce the secondary tissue damage simultaneously. Finally, melatonin may protect against exercise-induced fatigue and impairments. In this review, based on the documented evidence regarding the beneficial effects of melatonin, activity-based therapy and the combination of both on functional recovery, as well as reduction of secondary damage caused by oxidative stress after SCI, we suggest the melatonin combined with exercise would be a novel neurorehabilitative strategy for the faster recovery after SCI."

Despite the importance of oxidative stress in TBI, its role in apoptosis and Ca2+ entry in TBI is poorly understood. Therefore, we tested the effects of melatonin on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca2+ entry through the TRPM2 channel in the hippocampal neurons of TBI-induced rats. Thirty-two rats were divided into the following four groups: control, melatonin, TBI, and TBI + melatonin groups. Melatonin (5 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally given to animals in the melatonin group and the TBI + melatonin group after 1 h of brain trauma.

Apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-9, intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) values were high in the TBI group, and low in the TBI + melatonin group. The [Ca2+](i) concentration was decreased in the four groups by 2-APB.

METHODS: The weight-dropping method was used to produce the experimental SCI in adult rats. Res (50, 100 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (MPSS) 100 mg/kg were injected ip immediately after the induction of SCI. The effects of Res on edema, LDH, Na+, K+-ATPase, and MDA were determined at 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h after SCI compared with MPSS. The electron microscope was employed to investigate the ultrastructural effects of Res on axons, neurons, and subcellular organelles after SCI. RESULTS: Res obviously inhibited the secondary spinal cord edema with the most remarkable suppressing rate by 11.5 % at 48 h. Res significantly suppressed the activities of the lactate dehydrogenase with the highest suppressing rate > 40 % at 24 h. Res markedly improved the Na+, K+-ATPase activities that were promoted to the biggest extent of 60 % at 48 h. At the same time, Res (50 and 100 mg/kg) obviously reduced MDA production in the injured spinal cord tissue in comparison with the SCI model, the most remarkable effect of Res was detected at 48 h with the inhibitory rate >40 %. The ultrastructural findings suggested that SCI caused profound spinal cord damage, which could be protected or improved by injection of Res and MPSS. CONCLUSION: Both Res and MPSS effectively protected the spinal cord from secondary spinal cord injures. But the effects of Res 50 and 100 mg/kg were stronger in improving the energy metabolism system and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation in the local injured spinal cord after SCI than MPSS at the dose of 100 mg/kg. Res might have greatly potent therapeutic effects on SCI."

Recent evidence shows that melatonin is a scavenger of oxyradicals and peroxynitrite and exerts protective effects in septic shock, hemorrhagic shock and inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of melatonin treatment, in a model of spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 50 g) to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy. SCI in rats resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis (measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling staining). Infiltration of spinal cord tissue with neutrophils (measured as increase in myeloperoxidase activity) was associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation (increased tissue levels of malondialdehyde). Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated a marked increase in immunoreactivity for nitrotyrosine and Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) in the spinal cord tissue. In contrast, the degree of (a) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), (b) nitrotyrosine and PAR formation, (c) neutrophils infiltration and (d) apoptosis was markedly reduced in spinal cord tissue obtained from rats treated with melatonin (50 mg/kg i.p., 30 min before SCI, 30 min, 6 hr, 12 hr and 24 hr after SCI). In a separate set of experiment we have clearly demonstrated that melatonin treatment significantly ameliorated the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). Taken together, our results demonstrate that treatment with melatonin reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury events associated with spinal cord trauma."

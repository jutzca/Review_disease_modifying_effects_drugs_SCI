Specifically, in the case of spinal injuries, these factors can stimulate neuronal recovery. They are applied both in experimental models and in clinical trials in patients. The trophic factors analysed in this review include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), growth hormone (GH), melatonin, oestrogens, the family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), the family of neurotrophins and the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). There are some trophic (neurotrophic) factors that already been tested in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), but only shown partial recovery effect. It is possible that, the administration of these trophic factors together with physical rehabilitation, act synergistically and, therefore, significantly improve the quality of life of patients with SCI.","acetate"

Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the most commonly used drug for Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients that exerts an immunomodulatory effect against Myelin basic protein (MBP) antigen. Materials and methods: High-dose (2mg/kg) treatment of GA for 28 consecutive days after SCI was compared with its low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) treatment, SCI control and Sham control rat groups. Results: High-dose GA group had significantly worsened outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control and low-dose GA groups, which was confirmed by augmented spinal cavity volume and reduced ventral horn motor neurons in high-dose GA group; however, there was no significant difference between low-dose GA and control SCI group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that high-dose GA injection has more significant effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to low-dose GA and control SCI groups, which was associated with significant increase in IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-17A secretion. Conclusion: Along with confirmation of deleterious aspects of autoimmunity resulting from autoreactive lymphocytes against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that high-dose immunotherapy using GA, especially in acute phase after SCI, overwhelms any neuroprotective effect of adoptive immune system.","acetate"

NF-kappa B may be involved in the secondary injury of SCI that is mediated by inflammation and aggravates damage. Our study was aimed to investigate the role of NF-kappa B signaling in DUSP19-mediated cleaved Caspase-3 expression and the release of inflammatory factors in vivo and in vitro. Materials and Methods: DUSP19 mRNA expression and the content of IL-6 and IL-8 in patients with traumatic SCI (TSCI) were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The levels of p-NF-kappa Bp65, NF-kappa Bp65 and cleaved Caspase-3 expression and the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured by western blotting and ELISA, respectively. Results: Patients with TSCI showed lower DUSP19 expression and higher concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with healthy controls. DUSP19 overexpression inhibited p-NF-kappa Bp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and production of IL-8 and IL-6 in the mice induced by TSCI. DUSP19 silencing increased p-NF-kappa Bp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in mouse primary microglia cells. DUSP19 overexpression had an inverse effect. Importantly, DUSP19 silencing and overexpression mediated p-NF-kappa Bp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in mouse primary microglia cells were reversed by NF-kappa B inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and NF-kappa B activator 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), respectively.

Guanabenz acetate was administered twice daily for 8 weeks. In the first group, the treatment significantly increased blood flow in the abdominal aorta. All cats treated with guanabenz acetate 3 hr after spinal cord contusion had return of micturition and none suffered complete paraplegia. Four animals had partial and the other four had complete motor recovery. A superoxide (O2-.) generating system, horseradish peroxidase, decreased [C-14]gamma amino butyric acid uptake by mouse cortical slices by 33% but when superoxide dismutase was added to the medium, the uptake was reduced by only 9%. The nerve endings were also protected by superoxide dismutase from morphologic damage by O2-. as observed by electron microscopy. The agents used in these studies produce their ameliorating effects by virtue of their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and membrane stabilizing properties, and enhancing the regional microcirculation. In addition to having these properties, guanabenz acetate is also an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist.","acetate"

In neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, there is prominent infiltration and a long-lasting representation of various leukocyte subsets in the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma. Even in classic neurodegenerative disorders, where such immense inflammatory infiltrates are absent, there is still evidence of activated CNS-intrinsic microglia. The consequences of excessive and uncontrolled neuroinflammation are injury and death to neural elements, which manifest as a heterogeneous set of neurological symptoms. However, it is now readily acknowledged, due to instructive studies from the peripheral nervous system and a large body of CNS literature, that aspects of the neuroinflammatory response can be beneficial for CNS outcomes. The recognized benefits of inflammation to the CNS include the preservation of CNS constituents (neuroprotection), the proliferation and maturation of various neural precursor populations, axonal regeneration, and the reformation of myelin on denuded axons. Herein, we highlight the benefits of neuroinflammation in fostering CNS recovery after neural injury using examples from multiple sclerosis, traumatic spinal cord injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. We focus on CNS regenerative responses, such as neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, and remyelination, and discuss the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation is proregenerative for the CNS. Finally, we highlight treatment strategies that harness the benefits of neuroinflammation for CNS regenerative responses.","acetate"

Moreover depression can be induced by administration of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 or IFN-alpha. However, recent studies in specific pathogen-free (SPF) rodents suggest a different and potentially contradictory relationship between immune processes and mental health. These studies suggest that effector T cells specific for central nervous system (CNS) antigens can assist recovery from an array of environmental insults ranging from nerve injury to psychological stress, while in contrast, regulatory T cells (Treg) oppose such recovery. Indeed, some reported effects of this so-called ""protective autoimmunity"" seem of direct relevance to depressive disorders. These findings pose a dilemma for those intending to manipulate inflammatory pathways as a treatment for depression. Should we administer anti-inflammatory treatments, or should we induce self-reactive T cells? We re-examine the rodent findings and outline immunological peculiarities of SPF rodents, the abnormal properties of their regulatory T cells, and the impact of gut microbiota. We find that ""protective autoimmunity"" is likely to be relevant only to very clean SPF animals that lack normal levels of activated T cells, CNS T cell traffic and mature Treg. The data indicate that even in SPF models the effectors of beneficial effects are not the proinflammatory autoimmune cells themselves, but rather unidentified regulatory cells. This reinterpretation of findings relevant to ""protective autoimmunity"" suggests that ongoing, and planned, clinical trials of anti-inflammatory strategies to treat depressive disorders are justified.

A 56-year-old man reported immediate sharp shooting pain to the upper extremities on introduction of epidural toughy needle. A total of 5 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine and 120 mg methylprednisolone acetate suspension was administered at the C6-7 interspace. Within half an hour, a neurologic deficit occurred at C7-8 and right Brown-Sequard syndrome developed. Once SEH was suspected (3 hours after onset of neurologic deficit), a protocol of high-dose MP intravenous infusion was initiated. Immediate incomplete recovery of motor, sensory, and sphincteric functions was noted within 30 minutes of infusion. Emergency spinal C6-T2 bilateral decompressive laminectomies and evacuation SEH were performed within an expected delay (10 hours from the onset of neurologic deficit). Fluoroscopic guidance does not take the place of adherence to meticulous technique. An unexplained neurologic deficit after invasive spinal procedures should raise the concern for SEH. Early recognition and emergent evacuation remain the mainstay management for SEH. This case suggests some neuroprotection from IMP in cases of cervicothoracic cord compression secondary to traumatic SEH. When potential risks for SEH exist, it is advisable not to administer local anesthetic so as not to interfere with neurologic assessment and delaying the diagnosis.","acetate"

Here we show that in mice with closed head injury, the immune system plays a key role in the spontaneous recovery. Strain-related differences were observed in the ability to harness a T cell-dependent protective mechanism against the effects of the injury.

Consequently, the purpose of this study was to test the capacity of alpha tocopherol, the major lipid antioxidant in cellular membranes and a compound that limits the injury-induced lipid hydrolysis and peroxidation in spinal cord tissue, to promote functional recovery in a static loading model of spinal cord injury. After laminectomy, the L2 spinal cord of cats was compressed with 180 g for 5 min. For 5 days before injury and for 5 days postinjury, treated cats received orally 1000 IUD-alpha tocopherol acetate daily. Control cats were similarly injured but untreated. All cats were blindly evaluated weekly for 4 weeks for their neurologic recovery based on an 11 point behavioral scale that assessed walking, running, and stair climbing.

By 4 weeks, treated cats had recovered 72% of their preinjury function as compared with 20% for untreated controls, i.e., a 3.5-fold difference.

Due to the unique nature of the central nervous system (CNS) as an immune privileged site, it was commonly believed that the nervous system functions optimally without any immune intervention, and that any immune cell infiltration to the CNS is a sign of pathology. However, since the immune system constitutes the body's major defense and repair mechanism, it seemed unreasonable that the CNS would have completely lost the need for assistance from this system. This insight prompted us to revisit the entire question of whether immune cells are required for recovery from CNS injuries. We subsequently made numerous fundamental observations that led us to formulate a unified theory linking all neurodegenerative conditions; thus, we suggested that ""T-cell immunity to self maintains the self,"" at least in the CNS. According to this view, immunity to self (""protective autoimmunity"") provides a pivotal role in maintenance, protection, and repair of the healthy and diseased CNS. We further showed that the T cells mediate their effect, at least under pathological conditions, by controlling the recruitment of blood-borne monocytes, which play a crucial local role that cannot be replaced by the resident microglia. Boosting of such a T cell response specific for brain proteins, while carefully choosing the antigen, the carrier, timing, dosing, and regimen should be considered as a way of augmenting a physiological repair mechanism needed to ameliorate disease conditions while restoring equilibrium needed for protection, repair and renewal; such therapy is not intended to modify a single mediator of a single disease, but rather, would serve as an approach for adjusting the levels of the immune response needed to restore a lost balance.

Established literature has shown that oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of acute CNS injuries. Recently, there have been many studies on the topic of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Some studies have revealed an emerging connection between acute CNS injuries and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, induced by the abnormal metabolism of lipids, glutathione (GSH), and iron, can accelerate acute CNS injuries. However, pharmaceutical agents, such as iron chelators, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), and liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), can inhibit ferroptosis and may have neuroprotective effects after acute CNS injuries. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this connection has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this paper, we discuss the general mechanisms of ferroptosis and its role in stroke, TBI, and SCI. We also summarize ferroptosis-related drugs and highlight the potential therapeutic strategies in treating various acute CNS injuries. Additionally, this paper suggests a testable hypothesis that ferroptosis may be a novel direction for further research of acute CNS injuries by providing corresponding evidence.","acetylcysteine"

This lipid peroxidation is catalyzed by labile ferric iron. Therefore, iron import mediated via transferrin receptors and both, enzymatic and non-enzymatic iron-dependent radical formation are crucial prerequisites for the execution of ferroptosis. Intriguingly, the dynamin inhibitor dynasore, which has been shown to block transferrin receptor endocytosis, can protect from ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as neuronal cell death following spinal cord injury. Yet, it is unknown how dynasore exerts these cell death-protective effects. Using small interfering RNA suppression, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron tracers and bona fide inducers of ferroptosis, we find that dynasore treatment in lung adenocarcinoma and neuronal cell lines strongly protects these from ferroptosis. Surprisingly, while the dynasore targets dynamin 1 and 2 promote extracellular iron uptake, their silencing was not sufficient to block ferroptosis suggesting that this route of extracellular iron uptake is dispensable for acute induction of ferroptosis and dynasore must have an additional off-target activity mediating full ferroptosis protection. Instead, in intact cells, dynasore inhibited mitochondrial respiration and thereby mitochondrial ROS production which can feed into detrimental lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death in the presence of labile iron. In addition, in cell free systems, dynasore showed radical scavenger properties and acted as a broadly active antioxidant which is superior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in blocking ferroptosis. Thus, dynasore can function as a highly active inhibitor of ROS-driven types of cell death via combined modulation of the iron pool and inhibition of general ROS by simultaneously blocking two routes required for ROS and lipid-ROS driven cell death, respectively. These data have important implications for the interpretation of studies observing tissue-protective effects of this dynamin inhibitor as well as raise awareness that off-target ROS scavenging activities of small molecules used to interrogate the ferroptosis pathway should be taken into consideration.","acetylcysteine"

The sciatic functional index (SFI) was also measured to assess the functional recovery post-nerve lesion. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided equally into the following groups: Naive (rats did not undergo surgical manipulation); Sham (rats in which all surgical procedures involved in CCI were used except the ligature), and CCI (rats in which four ligatures were tied loosely around the right common sciatic nerve), which received 2, 4, or 8 intraperitoneal injections of NAC (150 mg.kg(-1) . day(-1)) or saline beginning 4 h after CCI.

CCI induced a decrease in SFI as well as an increase in p-p38 expression and SAG in the spinal cord. The SFI showed a partial recovery at day 7 in saline-treated CCI rats, but recovery was improved in NAC-treated CCI rats. NAC induced a downregulation in p-p38 expression at all time-points evaluated, but did not reverse the increased SAG induced by CCI.

To generate the guidance pathway, adenovirus encoding these transcripts was injected at four positions along the corpus callosum. In all groups, GDNF adenovirus was also injected on the right side 2.5 mm from the midline at the desired transplant site. Four days later, a piece of VM tissue from embryonic day 14 rats was injected at the transplant site. All rats also received daily subcutaneous injections of N-acetyl-L-cysteinamide (NACA; 100 mu g per rat) as well as chondroitinase ABC at transplant site (10 U/ml, 2 mu l). Two weeks after transplantation, the rats were perfused and the brains dissected out. Coronal sections were cut and immunostained with antibody to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to identify and count dopaminergic fibers in the corpus callosum. In GFP-expressing pathways, TH+ fibers grew out of the transplants for a short distance in the corpus callosum. Very few TH+ fibers grew across the midline. However, pathways expressing GDNF supported more TH+ fiber growth across the midline into the contralateral hemisphere. Significantly greater numbers of TH+ fibers grew across the midline in animals expressing a combination of GDNF and GFR alpha 1 in the corpus callosum. These data suggest that expression of GDNF or a combination of GDNF and GFR alpha 1 can support the long-distance dopaminergic fiber growth from a VM transplant, with the combination having a superior effect.

The amide form of N-acetylcysteine (NACA) overcomes these limitations while maintaining a high antioxidant potential, and shows promise for combating secondary pathogenesis attributed to oxidative stress. Neurotrauma precipitates a rapid and prolonged disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics, whereby the production of reactive oxygen species overwhelms the endogenous antioxidant capacity of the cells. Two noteworthy papers from collaborative teams have recently been published in Experimental Neurology, in which NACA was applied to rodent models of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, respectively. Using sensitive methods to measure respiratory rates in isolated mitochondrial populations, treatment with NACA was shown to maintain mitochondrial function and boost antioxidant reserves, which corresponded with improvements in structural and functional outcomes in both studies. This commentary aims to highlight key findings from this research in a broader context, with an emphasis on methodological advances, future research possibilities, and potential applicability to brain and/or spinal cord injured patients.

Sciatic axotomy and nerve grafting were performed at 1 week after sural DRG neurons and motoneurons were retrogradely labeled with the fluorescent tracer Fast Blue. To assess the efficacy of axonal regeneration, a second fluorescent dye Fluoro-Ruby was applied distal. to the graft at 12 weeks after nerve repair. At 8-13 weeks after axotomy, only 52-56% of the sural sensory neurons remained in the lumbar DRG, while the majority of motoneurons survived the sciatic nerve injury. Nerve grafting alone or continuous intrathecal NAC treatment (2.4 mg/day) improved survival of sural DRG neurons. Combined treatment with nerve graft and NAC had significant additive effect on neuronal survival and also increased the number of sensory neurons regenerating across the graft. However, NAC treatment neither affected the number of regenerating motoneurons nor the number of myelinated axons in the nerve graft or in the distal nerve stump. The present results demonstrate that NAC provides a highly significant effect of neuroprotection in an animal nerve injury model and that combination with nerve grafting further attenuates retrograde cell death and promotes regeneration of sensory neurons.

The myriad of protective mechanisms of hypothermia include the slowing down of metabolism, decreasing free radical generation, inhibiting excitotoxicity and apoptosis, ameliorating inflammation, preserving the blood spinal cord barrier, inhibiting astrogliosis, promoting angiogenesis, as well as decreasing axonal damage and encouraging neurogenesis. Hypothermia has also been combined with other interventions, such as antioxidants, anesthetics, alkalinization and cell transplantation for additional benefit. Although a large body of work has reported on the effectiveness of hypothermia as a neuroprotective approach after SCI and its application has been translated to the clinic, a number of questions still remain regarding its use, including the identification of hypothermia's therapeutic window, optimal duration and the most appropriate rewarming rate.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of long-term antioxidant treatment on the survival of descending rubrospinal neurons after spinal cord injury in rats. It also examines the short-and long-term effects of treatment on apoptosis, inflammation, and regeneration in the spinal cord trauma zone. Spinal cord hemisection performed at the level C3 induced a significant loss of rubrospinal neurons 8 weeks after injury. At 2 weeks, an increase in the expression of the apoptosis-associated markers BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and caspase 3, as well as the microglial cell markers OX42 and ectodermal dysplasia 1 (ED1), was seen in the trauma zone. After 8 weeks, an increase in immunostaining for OX42 and the serotonin marker 5HT was detected in the same area. Antioxidant therapy reduced the loss of rubrospinal neurons by approximately 50%. Treatment also decreased the expression of BAX, caspase 3, OX42 and ED1 after 2 weeks. After 8 weeks, treatment decreased immunoreactivity for OX42, whereas it was increased for 5HT.

Restoration of mitochondria dysfunction during the acute phases of secondary injury after SCI represents a potentially effective therapeutic strategy. This review discusses the past and present pharmacological options for the treatment of SCI as well as current research on mitochondria-targeted approaches. Increased antioxidant activity, inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition, alternate energy sources, and manipulation of mitochondrial morphology are among the strategies under investigation. Unfortunately, many of these tactics address single aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately proving largely ineffective.

This secondary injury cascade causes nonmechanical tissue damage, which is where therapeutic interventions may be efficacious for intervention. One therapeutic target that has shown much promise following brain injury are mitochondria. Mitochondria are complex organelles found within the cell. At a superficial level, mitochondria are known to produce the energy substrate used within the cell called ATP. However, their importance to overall cellular homeostasis is even larger than their production of ATP. These organelles are necessary for calcium cycling, ROS production and play a role in the initiation of cell death pathways. When mitochondria become dysfunctional, they can become dysregulated leading to a loss of cellular homeostasis and eventual cell death. Within this review there will be a deep discussion into mitochondrial bioenergetics followed by a brief discussion into traumatic brain injury and how mitochondria play an integral role in the neuropathological sequelae following an injury.

Combined use of NAC and hypothermia resulted in highly significant recovery of spinal cord function. (C) 2003 The International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the current study we evaluated the efficacy of cell-permeating thiol, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), a precursor of endogenous antioxidant glutathione (GSH), on mitochondrial function acutely, and long-term tissue sparing and hindlimb locomotor recovery following upper lumbar contusion SCI. Some designated injured adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 120) received either vehicle or NACA (75, 150,300 or 600 mg/kg) at 15 mm and 6 h post-injury. After 24 h the total, synaptic, and non-synaptic mitochondrial populations were isolated from a single 1.5 cm spinal cord segment (centered at injury site) and assessed for mitochondrial bioenergetics. Results showed compromised total mitochondrial bioenergetics following acute SCI that was significantly improved with NACA treatment in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum effects at 300 mg/kg (n = 4/group). For synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria, only 300 mg/kg NACA dosage showed efficacy. Similar dosage (300 mg/kg) also maintained mitochondrial GSH near normal levels. Other designated injured rats (n = 21) received continuous NACA (150 or 300 mg/kg/day) treatment starting at 15 mm post-injury for one week to assess long-term functional recovery over 6 weeks post-injury. Locomotor testing and novel gait analyses showed significantly improved hindlimb function with NACA that were associated with increased tissue sparing at the injury site. Overall, NACA treatment significantly maintained acute mitochondrial bioenergetics and normalized GSH levels following SCI, and prolonged delivery resulted in significant tissue sparing and improved recovery of hindlimb function.

Ca2+ entry induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI) has deleterious effects on human hippocampal function. TRPM2 is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective channel in hippocampal neurons, and its activation of during oxidative stress has been linked to cell death. Despite the importance of oxidative stress in TBI, its role in apoptosis and Ca2+ entry in TBI is poorly understood. Therefore, we tested the effects of melatonin on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca2+ entry through the TRPM2 channel in the hippocampal neurons of TBI-induced rats. Thirty-two rats were divided into the following four groups: control, melatonin, TBI, and TBI + melatonin groups. Melatonin (5 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally given to animals in the melatonin group and the TBI + melatonin group after 1 h of brain trauma. Hippocampal neurons were freshly isolated from the four groups, incubated with a nonspecific TRPM2 blocker (2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate, 2-APB), and then stimulated with cumene hydroperoxide. Apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-9, intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) values were high in the TBI group, and low in the TBI + melatonin group. The [Ca2+](i) concentration was decreased in the four groups by 2-APB. In our TBI experimental model, TRPM2 channels were involved in Ca2+ entry-induced neuronal death, and the negative modulation of the activity of this channel by melatonin pretreatment may account for the neuroprotective activity of TRPM2 channels against oxidative stress, apoptosis, and Ca2+ entry.","acetylcysteine"

We demonstrate that spinal cord compression (5 s with a 50 g aneurysm clip) at T6 in rats results in oxidative stress that is extensive (significant increases in oxidative stress seen at C3 and L4) and rapid in onset. Indices of oxidative stress used were GSH content, protein carbonyl content, and inactivation of glutathione reductase. Administration of OTC resulted in a marked decrease in oxidative stress associated with a sparing of white matter at T6 (16 +/-1.9% retained in OTC-treated animals vs, less than 1% in saline-treated). Behavioral indices in control, saline-treated, and OTC-treated animals after 6 wk were respectively: angle board scores (59 degrees, 32 degrees, and 42 degrees), modified Tarlov score (7, 2.4, and 4.1), and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score (21, 5.3, and 12.9). We conclude that administration of OTC after spinal cord trauma greatly decreases oxidative stress and allows tissue preservation, thereby enabling otherwise paraplegic animals to locomote.","acetylcysteine"

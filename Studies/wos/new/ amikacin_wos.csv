As regard its use in the inner ear, stem cell transplantation was examined in many previous studies, while the mobilization idea is a new method to be experimented in inner ear hair cell regeneration. The present work assessed the possibility of mobilizing endogenous bone marrow derived stem cells (SCs) in rats using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to induce regeneration and repair to experimentally damaged inner ear hair cells by Amikacin injection.","amikacin"

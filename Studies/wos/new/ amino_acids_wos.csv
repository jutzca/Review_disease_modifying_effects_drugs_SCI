After injury, BSCB damage results in increasing capillary permeability and release of inflammatory factors. Recent studies have reported that haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) fragments lacking 23 amino acids at the C-terminus (HO-1C23) exert novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in vitro. However, no study has identified the role of HO-1C23 in vivo. We aimed to investigate the protective effects of HO-1C23 on the BSCB after spinal cord injury (SCI) in a rat model. Here, adenoviral HO-1C23 (Ad-GFP-HO-1C23) was intrathecally injected into the 10th thoracic spinal cord segment (T10) 7 days before SCI. In addition, nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction and immunofluorescence staining of HO-1 were used to examine the effect of Ad-GFP-HO-1C23 on HO-1 nuclear translocation. Evan's blue staining served as an index of capillary permeability and was detected by fluorescence microscopy at 633nm. Western blotting was also performed to detect tight junction protein expression. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score was used to evaluate kinematic functional recovery through the 28th day after SCI. In this study, the Ad-GFP-HO-1C23 group showed better kinematic functional recovery after SCI than the Ad-GFP and Vehicle groups, as well as smaller reductions in TJ proteins and capillary permeability compared with those in the Ad-GFP and Vehicle groups. These findings indicated that Ad-GFP-HO-1C23 might have a potential therapeutic effect that is mediated by its protection of BSCB integrity.","amino_acids"

One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan, but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to those of control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 d before and 28 d following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-T11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 d recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs. The results suggest that ketogenic diets need to be assessed based on the type and location of neurotrauma.","amino_acids"

In the current study, we identify the role of the T1R1/T1R3 receptor in granulocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in a rat spinal cord injury (SCI) model. We found that T1R1 and T1R3 were substantially expressed in both circulating and infiltrating granulocytes. In vitro stimulation of T1R1/T1R3 receptor with L-serine notably reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several pro-inflammatory cytokines. To evaluate the role of T1R1/T1R3 receptor in vivo, gurmarin, a selective T1R3 inhibitor, was injected into rats before and after SCI. Gurmarin administration significantly upregulated expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, myeloperoxidase, and matrix metallopeptidase 9, as well as production of ROS in infiltrating granulocytes. Signal pathway analysis revealed that gurmarin promoted nuclear factor (NF)-kappa beta signaling in infiltrating granulocytes. Consistently, cell apoptosis and inflammatory mediator levels at the injury sites were increased by gurmarin, together with higher T lymphocyte recruitment. Our research indicates that the T1R1/T1R3 receptor is an anti-inflammatory receptor for infiltrating granulocytes after SCI.

Evidence from blockage experiments suggests that over-expression and activation of purinergic receptors, especially P2X(7), produces excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases and trauma of the central nervous system. We hypothesize that the down-regulation of specific miRNAs after the SCI contributes to the over-expression of P2X(7) and that restorative strategies can be used to reduce the excitotoxic response. In the present study, we have employed bioinformatic analyses to identify microRNAs whose down-regulation following SCI can be responsible for P2X(7) over-expression and excitotoxic activity. Additional luciferase assays validated microRNA-135a-5p (miR-135a) as a posttranscriptional modulator of P2X(7). Moreover, gene expression analysis in spinal cord samples from a rat SCI model confirmed that the decrease in miR-135a expression correlated with P2X(7) over-expression after injury. Transfection of cultures of Neuro-2a neuronal cell line with a miR-135a inhibitory sequences (antagomiR-135a), simulating the reduction of miR-135a observed after SCI, resulted in the increase of P2X(7) expression and the subsequent ATP-dependent rise in intracellular calcium concentration. Conversely, a restorative strategy employing miR-135a mimicked reduced P2X(7) expression, attenuating the increase in intracellular calcium concentration that depends on this receptor and protecting cells from excitotoxic death. Therefore, we conclude that miR-135a is a potential therapeutic target for SCI and that restoration of its expression may reduce the deleterious effects of ATP-dependent excitotoxicity induced after a traumatic spinal cord injury.","amino_acids"

It is well known that taurine protects the brain from further damage after a traumatic event. However, only a few ex vivo studies have looked at the possible role of taurine in the regulation of axon regeneration after injury. Here, we aimed to reveal the possible role for taurine in the modulation of axonal regeneration following a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) using lampreys as an animal model. The brainstem of lampreys contains several individually identifiable descending neurons that differ greatly in their capacity for axonal regeneration after SCI. This offers a convenient model to promote or inhibit axonal regrowth in the same in vivo preparation. First, we carried out high performance liquid chromatography experiments to measure taurine levels in the spinal cord following SCI. Our results revealed a statistically significant increase in taurine levels 4 weeks post-lesion, which suggested that taurine might have a positive effect on axonal regrowth. Based on these results, we decided to apply an acute taurine treatment at the site of injury to study its effect on axon regeneration. Results from these experiments show that an acute taurine treatment enhances axonal regeneration following SCI in lampreys. This offers a novel way to try to promote axon regeneration after nervous system injuries in mammalian models.","amino_acids"

The use of specific antagonists can attenuate this secondary damage in marine models. However, the kinetics of this phenomenon must be precisely documented before launching clinical trials of multidrug therapy. Axonal regeneration, previously considered impossible within the mammalian central nervous system, depends on appropriate control of glial reactivity. This may be achieved through gene therapy (si RNA) targeting glial obstacles.

One of the earliest processes that follow SCI is the excitotoxicity resulting from the massive release of excitotoxicity mediators, including ATP, which induce an excessive and/or prolonged activation of their receptors and a deregulation of the calcium homeostasis. Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) is an endogenous purinergic agonist, present in both extracellular and intracellular fluids, with promising cytoprotective effects in different diseases including neurodegenerative processes. In a search for efficient neuroprotective strategies for SCI, we have tested the capability of Ap(4)A to reduce the excitotoxic death mediated by the ATP-induced deregulation of calcium homeostasis and its consequences on tissue preservation and functional recovery in a mouse model of moderate contusive SCI. Our analyses with the murine neural cell line Neuro2a demonstrate that treatment with Ap(4)A reduces ATP-dependent excitotoxic death by both lowering the intracellular calcium response and decreasing the expression of specific purinergic receptors. Follow-up analyses in a mouse model of contusive SCI showed that acute administration of Ap(4)A following SCI reduces tissue damage and improves motor function recovery. These results suggest that Ap(4)A cytoprotection results from a decrease of the purinergic tone preventing the effects of a massive release of ATP after SCI, probably together with a direct induction of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways via activation of P2Y(2) proposed in previous studies. In conclusion, Ap(4)A may be a good candidate for an SCI therapy, particularly to reduce excitotoxicity in combination with other modulators and/or inhibitors of the excitotoxic process that are being tested.","amino_acids"

We also detected a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1)?interacting Nogo-66 domain on the exosome surface. Enzyme inhibitor treatment and siRNA knockdown revealed that ?-secretase 1 (BACE1) is the protease responsible for Nogo-A cleavage.

Here, we asked whether similar recovery occurs following lumbar injury that impacts more directly on the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). As in thoracic injuries, lumbar injuries caused about 90% neuronal loss at the injury site and increased serotonergic innervation below the injury. Motor recovery was slower after lumbar than thoracic injury, but virtually normal function was attained by P25 in both cases. Locomotor CPG status was tested by eliciting fictive locomotion in isolated spinal cords using a widely used neurochemical cocktail (NMDA, dopamine, serotonin). No fictive locomotion could be elicited 1 day post-injury, but could within 3days post-injury as readily as in age-matched uninjured control spinal cords. Burst patterning and coordination were largely similar in injured and control spinal cords but there were differences. Notably, in both groups there were two main locomotor frequencies, but injured spinal cords exhibited a shift towards the higher frequency. Injury also altered the neurochemical dependence of locomotor CPG output, such that injured spinal cords, unlike control spinal cords, were incapable of generating low frequency rhythmic coordinated activity in the presence of NMDA and dopamine alone. Thus, the neonatal spinal cord also exhibits remarkable functional recovery after lumbar injuries, but the neurochemical sensitivity of locomotor circuitry is modified in the process.","amino_acids"

Further, we found that dietary LC-O3PUFAs impacted the levels of neurotransmitters and the mitochondrial metabolism, as evidenced by significant increases in the levels of N-acetylglutamate (+43 %) and acetyl CoA levels (+27 %), respectively. Interestingly, this dietary intervention resulted in a global correction of the pro-oxidant metabolic profile that characterized the SCI-mediated sensorimotor dysfunction. In summary, the significant benefits of metabolic homeostasis and increased antioxidant defenses unlock important neurorestorative pathways of dietary LC-O3PUFAs against SCI.","amino_acids"

The spinal cord ischemia was induced at midthoracic level by a recently developed photochemical technique using laser irradiation and photoactivatable intravascular dyes. An allodynia-like sensory disturbance, where the animals reacted by vocalization to non-noxious mechanical stimuli in the flank area, was consistently seen during several days after ischemia. Pretreatment with 10 and 20 mg/kg, but not 5 mg/kg naltrexone i.v. 10 min before irradiation decreased the incidence of allodynia. However, even the effect of the highest dose of naltrexone (20 mg/kg) was incomplete, which is in contrast to the effect of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, which has been tested in the same model and found to completely prevent the incidence of allodynia at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Pretreatment with sub- or suprathreshold doses of naltrexone (5 and 20 mg/kg respectively) combined with a subthreshold dose of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) did not produce a synergistic effect. When naltrexone (20 mg/kg) was administered 10 min after induction of ischemia, it was totally ineffective in decreasing the occurrence and severity of allodynia. In contrast, MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) still had a good protective effect when injected as this time. Histological examination showed slight morphological damage in the spinal cord in 38% of control rats after 1 min laser irradiation without pretreatment with naltrexone. No morphological abnormalities were observed in rats after pretreatment with naltrexone (20 mg/kg). The results suggest that opioid receptor antagonists and NMDA receptor antagonists prevent a consequence of transient spinal cord ischemia through different mechanisms. High doses of opioid antagonists may have anti-ischemic effects by improving local spinal cord microcirculation and therefore may have a role in preventing ischemia after traumatic spinal cord injury. On the other hand, the NMDA receptor may have a role in the secondary neuronal death resulting from ischemia. Thus, NMDA receptor antagonists may contribute to the prevention of tissue damage by antagonizing the excitotoxic action of glutamate and/or aspartate released by ischemia into the spinal cord. Finally, since only high doses of naltrexone had an effect in the present study, we cannot rule out the possiblity that this drug may act through non-opioid mechanisms.","amino_acids"

Finding factors that reduce the inflammatory response and glial scar formation, and increase neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, are of major importance for improving the outcome after spinal cord injury (SCI). In the present study, we evaluated a new treatment aiming to remove central nervous system (CNS) Glu into the systemic blood circulation by intravenous (IV) administration of blood Glu scavengers (BGS) such as the enzyme recombinant glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (rGOT1) and its co-substrate. In this study we induced in mice an SCI (hemisection), and 1h post-injury started administering BGS treatment for 5 consecutive days. The treatment reduced the expression levels of p-p38, which regulates apoptosis and increased the expression of p-Akt, which mediates cell survival. Moreover, this treatment decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and microglia activation, reduced astrocytes' reactivity, and facilitated expression of radial glia markers such as Pax6 and nestin. BGS treatment increased the survival of neurons at lesion site and enabled axonal regeneration into the injury site. These effects were correlated with improved functional recovery of the left paretic hindlimb. Thus, early pharmacological intervention with BGS following SCI may be neuroprotective and create a pro-regenerative environment by modulating glia cell response. In light of our results, the availability of the method to remove excess Glu from CNS without the need to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and with minimal or no adverse effects may provide a major therapeutic asset.","amino_acids"

However, nutritional intervention (such as with branched chain amino acids [BCAAs]) has emerged as a promising treatment option for TBI. Objectives: (1) To determine whether TBI patients have lower levels of endogenous BCAAs postinjury; and (2) to evaluate whether post-TBI BCAA supplementation improves clinical outcome. Design: A systematic review of primary research articles examining the relationship between BCAAs and TBI recovery indexed in Ovid/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Results: Of the 11 studies identified, 3 examined the effects of TBI on endogenous BCAA levels and consistently reported that BCAA concentrations were depressed postinjury. The remaining 8 studies examined the effects of BCAA supplementation on TBI outcome in animals (n = 3) and humans (n = 5). The animal studies (in mild-to-moderate TBI) showed that BCAAs improved post-TBI outcome. Similar results were found in human trials (conducted primarily in patients with severe TBI), with 4 of the 5 studies reporting improved outcome with BCAA supplementation. Conclusion: Although our review demonstrates an overall positive association between BCAAs and TBI outcome, the evidence of the efficacy of supplementation has been limited to severe TBI. To date, there is insufficient evidence to determine the benefits of BCAAs in mild TBI. Given the high frequency of mild TBI and the promise of BCAAs as an intervention in severe TBI, future research should examine the effects of BCAAs in milder brain injury.","amino_acids"

Although the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood, previous studies from our laboratory indicate that inhibiting activation of the nuclear factor-B transcription factor in astrocytes reduces white matter damage and improves functional recovery following spinal cord injury. In the current study, we demonstrate that activation of the nuclear factor-B transcription factor within astrocytes results in a significant increase in oligodendrocyte death following trauma by reducing extracellular zinc levels and inducing glutamate excitotoxicity. By using an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (CNQX), we show that astroglial nuclear factor-B-mediated oligodendrocyte death is dependent on glutamate signaling despite no change in extracellular glutamate concentrations. Further analysis demonstrated a reduction in levels of extracellular zinc in astrocyte cultures with functional nuclear factor-B signaling following trauma. Cotreatment of oligodendrocytes with glutamate and zinc showed a significant increase in oligodendrocyte toxicity under low-zinc conditions, suggesting that the presence of zinc at specific concentrations can prevent glutamate excitotoxicity. These studies demonstrate a novel role for zinc in regulating oligodendrocyte excitotoxicity and identify new therapeutic targets to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death in central nervous system trauma and disease.

Thus, it is of crucial importance to find ways to promote axonal regeneration. In addition, the prevention of retrograde degeneration leading to the atrophy/death of descending neurons is an obvious prerequisite to activate axonal regeneration. Lampreys show an amazing regenerative capacity after SCI. Recent histological work in lampreys suggested that GABA, which is massively released after a SCI, could promote the survival of descending neurons. Here, we aimed to study if GABA, acting through GABAB receptors, promotes the survival and axonal regeneration of descending neurons of larval sea lampreys after a complete SCI. First, we used in situ hybridization to confirm that identifiable descending neurons of late-stage larvae express the gabab1 subunit of the GABAB receptor. We also observed an acute increase in the expression of this subunit in descending neurons after SCI, which further supported the possible role of GABA and GABAB receptors in promoting the survival and regeneration of these neurons. So, we performed gain and loss of function experiments to confirm this hypothesis. Treatments with GABA and baclofen (GABAB agonist) significantly reduced caspase activation in descending neurons 2 weeks after a complete SCI. Long-term treatments with GABOB (a GABA analogue) and baclofen significantly promoted axonal regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. These data indicate that GABAergic signalling through GABAB receptors promotes the survival and regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. Finally, we used morpholinos against the gabab1 subunit to knockdown the expression of the GABAB receptor in descending neurons. Long-term morpholino treatments caused a significant inhibition of axonal regeneration. This shows that endogenous GABA promotes axonal regeneration after a complete SCI in lampreys by activating GABAB receptors.","amino_acids"

We studied the levels of glutamate and glycine in the lumbar spinal cord of spinally transected rats. Rats (n = 48) received spinal cord transection at 5 days of age, and 4 weeks later half were trained to step using a robotic treadmill system and the remaining half were untrained controls.

The cost of treating both of them (initial regeneration failure and following complications) would be prohibitive, particularly in less developed nations. The well-recognized circumstances arose from primary SCI include excitotoxicity and inflammation. SCI increases concentrations of extracellular amino acids (EAAs) in the severity-dependent manner and the maximum level of EAAs at the injury site will be reduced by distance from the injury site. Increased concentrations of EAAs and their signaling result in energy and metabolic changes and eventually neurotoxicity. Therefore EAAs play a crucial role in moving towards secondary stage of SCI. There is a close correspondence between severity of SCI and intensity of acute inflammatory response, which includes proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) and immune cells (neutrophils, microglia, and mast cells). The communication between microglia and astrocytes mediate formation of astroglial scar. The scar is thought to diminish the spread of inflammation and lesion volume, and on the other side poses an obstacle to achieving axon regeneration. Moreover, mast cells exert an anti-inflammatory role in the ground of injured spinal cord by degradation of proinflammatory mediators, while mast cells-derived histamine may cause excitotoxicity. Therefore research suggests a very double-sword remark about the work of inflammatory mediators in the injured spinal cord. Myelin associated inhibitors (MAIs) are among the growing list of extrinsic inhibitors of neuroregeneration in the injured-CNS. They function via NgR-dependent mechanisms. The time for intervention by NgR antagonists must be fixed according to the expression pattern of this receptor and its dependent MAIs after SCI. Altogether, experimental studies suggest potential benefits of combating EAAs, inflammatory mediators, and MAIs during the first minutes, hours and weeks after SCI, respectively. However, acute inflammation initially induced by SCI tends to be permanent, even at several years after SCI. This supports the notion that paying attention to inflammation must persist through time. The consideration of seconds-dependent state of spinal cord after primary injury is a very therapeutic and also preventive approach against future possible complications. It is thereby possible to propose ""timing"", which is perfectly practicable throughout the world, as an effective campaign against the final failure of SCI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This pain negatively affects quality of life and is difficult to treat. Opioids are among the most effective drug treatments, and are commonly prescribed, but experimental evidence suggests that opioid treatment in the acute phase of injury can attenuate recovery of locomotor function. In fact, spinal cord injury and opioid administration share several common features (e.g. central sensitization, excitotoxicity, aberrant glial activation) that have been linked to impaired recovery of function, as well as the development of pain. Despite these effects, the interactions between opioid use and spinal cord injury have not been fully explored. A review of the literature, described here, suggests that caution is warranted when administering opioids after SCI. Opioid administration may synergistically contribute to the pathology of SCI to increase the development of pain, decrease locomotor recovery, and leave individuals at risk for infection. Considering these negative implications, it is important that guidelines are established for the use of opioids following spinal cord and other central nervous system injuries.

Neuroprotection soon after injury using pharmacological tools to reduce the progressive secondary injury processes that follow during the first week after the initial lesion. This strategy was conducted up to clinical trials, showing that a pharmacological therapy can reduce the permanent neurological deficit that usually follows an acute injury of the central nervous system (CNS). A second strategy, which is initiated not long after the lesion, aims at promoting axonal regeneration by acting on the main barrier to regeneration of lesioned. axons: the glial scar. Finally a mid-term substitutive strategy is the management of the sublesional spinal cord by sensorimotor stimulation and/or supply of missing key afferents, such as monoaminergic systems. These three strategies are reviewed. Only a combination of these different approaches will be able to provide an optimal basis for potential therapeutic interventions directed to functional recovery after spinal cord injury.","amino_acids"

Two IV doses were administrated (placebo, 2x0.005mg/kg, 2x0.001mg/kg, 2x0.02mg/kg): the first dose was given within 2 hours following the trauma, and the second dose 4 hours after the first. Fifty-one patients were enrolled and 48 studied between March 1995 and June 1997 in France. Evaluation criteria for safety were physical examination, cardiovascular parameters, blood chemistry, hematology, ECG, and neuropsychological changes monitored after medication. Primary evaluation criteria for efficacy was the Glasgow coma scale complemented by the initial CT-scan and Glasgow outcome scale, motor deficiencies, neuropsychological changes, and functional indenpendence at D90 and D365 or endpoint. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was not taken into account because all the clinical centers participating in this study did not use this technique in daily practice during the inclusion period. Twelve patients died during the follow-up period, none of these deaths being related to the drug. Serious adverse events (181) were reported by most of the patients with no significant differences between groups. Only 10 of these adverse events were considered to be drug-related. Safety-related laboratory tests did not show any relevant. Concerning efficacy, the predefined prognostic factors (initial CT-scan score, initial Glasgow Coma Scale and occurrence of low systolic blood pressure during the first 24 hours) largely determinated the patient's outcome. When the prognostic factors were taken into account together with the dose level in a logistic regression model, gacyclidine showed a beneficial long-term effect and a best dose-result in the 0.04mg/kg treated group.

Spinal cord injury causes tissue damage in two successive waves. The initial injury is mechanical and directly causes primary tissue damage, which induces subsequent ischemia, inflammation, and neurotoxic factor release resulting in the secondary tissue damage. These lead to activation of glial cells. Activated glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes are common pathological observations in the damaged lesion. Activated microglia release glutamate, the major neurotoxic factor released into the extracellular space after neural injury, which causes neuronal death at high concentration. In the present study, we demonstrate that reduction of glutamate-mediated exitotoxicity via intraperitoneal administration of INI-0602 in the microenvironment of the injured spinal cord elicited neurobehavioral recovery and extensive suppression of glial scar formation by reducing secondary tissue damage.

In dorsal column white matter, total intensity of GLT1-eGFP expression per region was significantly reduced following SCI at both lesion epicenter and at rostral and caudal areas where no tissue loss occurred. This regional decrease in GLT1 expression was due to significant loss of GLT1-eGFP 1 cells, partially accounted for by apoptosis of eGFP(+)/GFAP(+) astrocytes in both white and gray matter. There were also decreased numbers of GLT1-eGFP-expressing cells in multiple gray matter regions following injury; nevertheless, there was sustained or even increased regional GLT1-eGFP expression in gray matter as a result of up-regulation in astrocytes that continued to express GLT1-eGFP. Although there were increased numbers of GFAP(+) cells both at the lesion site and in surrounding intact spinal cord following SCI, the majority of proliferating Ki67(+)/GFAP(+) astrocytes did not express GLT1-eGFP. These findings demonstrate that spatial and temporal alterations in GLT1 expression observed after SCI result from both astrocyte death and gene expression changes in surviving astrocytes. Results also suggest that following SCI a significant portion of astrocytes lacks GLT1 expression, possibly compromising the important role of astrocytes in glutamate homeostasis.

In this work, the extent and time courses of glutamate-induced losses of neurons and oligodendrocytes are established. Glutamate was administered into the spinal cords of anesthetized rats at approximately the concentration and duration of its release following SCI. Cells in normal tissue, in tissue exposed to artificial cerebrospinal fluid and in tissue exposed to glutamate were counted on a confocal system in control animals and from 6 h to 28 days after treatment to assess cell losses. Oligodendrocytes were identified by staining with antibody CC-1 and neurons by immunostaining for Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN) or Neurofilament H. The density of oligodendrocytes declined precipitously in the first 6 h after exposure to glutamate, and then relatively little from 24 h to 28 days post-exposure. Similarly, neuron densities first declined rapidly, but at a decreasing rate, from 0 h to 72 h post-glutamate exposure and did not change significantly from 72 h to 28 days thereafter. The nuclei of many cells strongly and specifically stained for activated caspase-3, an indicator of apoptosis, in response to exposure to glutamate. Caspase-3 was localized to the nucleus and may participate in apoptotic cell death. However, persistence of caspase-3 staining for at least a week after exposure to glutamate during little to no loss of oligodendrocytes and neurons demonstrates that elevation of caspase-3 does not necessarily lead to rapid cell death. Beyond about 48 h after exposure to glutamate, locomotor function began to recover while cell numbers stabilized or declined slowly, demonstrating that functional recovery in the experiments presented involves processes other than replacement of oligodendrocytes and/or neurons.

Mechanical thresholds were measured behaviorally, and the excitability of wide-dynamic-range (WDR) dorsal horn neurons in the lumbar cord (L4-L5) was measured to assess central neuropathic pain.

Western blots revealed expression of GluR1, 3, and 4, but not GluR2, in spinal cord white matter. Immumohistochemistry was used to examine the distribution of AMPARs in spinal cord white matter. Quantification of AMPAR-expressing cells in spinal cord white matter indicated predominantly GluR3 expression in oligodendrocytes and predominantly GluR4 expression in astrocytes. A clip compression model of SCI was used to examine the changes in AMPAR expression in dorsal column white matter after injury. Quantitative analysis of GluR3 levels of expression indicated a significant decrease at 3 days postinjury compared to uninjured animals, followed by a recovery of expression by 2 weeks. GluR4 subunits followed a similar expression pattern. Gene message expression of GluR3 and GluR4 flip/flop mRNA splice variants exhibited a pattern of expression that correlated with protein expression. GluR3-expressing glia appeared to be more susceptible to apoptosis than GluR4-expressing cells.

We have studied the effect of pretreatment with CMZ on motor function recovery and nerve cell damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats were randomized and 30 min before SCI they received a single intraperitoneal dose of CMZ (150 mg/kg) or saline. The spinal cord was injured with a 50 g (4.5 g/mm(2)) load, applied over the exposed dura, through a curved rectangular plate (2.2 x 5.0 mm) for 5 min at T8-9. The animals became paraplegic 1 day after injury. The rats were evaluated for recovery of hind limb motor function. All animals recovered to some extent over the observation period of 12 weeks. However, hind limb motor function was significantly better in the animals pretreated with CMZ. At 12 weeks the rats were killed and perfused/fixed for morphological investigations. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunostaining was used to stain neurons and dendrites and Luxol-fast blue to stain myelinated tracts of the white matter. The injured segment of the spinal cord showed severe atrophy, distortion, cavitation and necrosis of grey and white matter. Compared to uninjured controls the transverse sectional area was reduced to 32.7 +/- 4% in untreated animals but only to 38.5% +/- 4.1 in CMZ-treated animals. MAP2 staining showed that, compared to uninjured controls, grey matter was reduced to 7.4 +/- 2.7% in saline-treated injured animals and to 22.7 +/- 5.4% in CMZ-treated rats. Our results thus show that in this model CMZ improves hind limb motor function and attenuates the morphological damage to the spinal cord.","amino_acids"

Microdialysis probes were inserted into exposed grey matter of the dorsal horn at the level of Th 7-8, and perfused with mock cerebrospinal fluid. The trauma was produced 2 hours later by compression of the cord with a 9-, 35-, or 50-g load for 5 min. Microdialysis samples (10-minute fractions) were collected for another 2 hours following decompression. The trauma was associated with an accumulation of lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine, and an increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio in the ECF, indicating a profound disturbance in energy metabolism. These changes were related to the severity of spinal cord injury as well as to the spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) reductions and neurological deteriorations previously determined. Following decompression, all ECF metabolites normalized within 20-40 min after mild (9 g) to moderate (35 g) trauma. After severe trauma (50 g), resulting in complete ischemia during compression, followed by irreversible paraplegia, there was a partial recovery of ECF inosine and hypoxanthine, whereas the increase in lactate and the lactate/pyruvate ratio persisted. The results suggest that penumbra conditions prevail during the early posttraumatic period when the degree of trauma results in severe neurological deterioration and that ECF lactate levels in the spinal cord is a sensitive indicator of secondary ischemia after compression injury.","amino_acids"

The spinal cord of rats was damaged by a photochemical method and the animals were treated by saline or gacyclidine at doses of 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg 10 min after injury or gacyclidine 1 mg/kg 10, 30, 60, and 120 min after injury. The time-course of the motor score (walking and inclined-plane stability) was evaluated until day 18, and somatosensory evoked potentials were determined on day 18. The animals were then sacrificed, and the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord (at the epicenter of the injury, above and below the injury) was measured. Walking recovery was better in most of the groups treated after injury than in the untreated injured animals. Motor performances were related to preservation of a larger undamaged area of spinal cord at the level of the injury and, interestingly, with prevention of extension of the anatomical lesion above the level of the injury. Somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes were often higher in treated groups. These results confirm that gacyclidine induces dose-dependent and time-dependent attenuation of spinal cord damage after an experimental vascular lesion. Although all three doses induced neuroprotective effects, recovery was greater and very homogeneous in the group treated with 1 mg/kg. Moreover, recovery was slightly better and more homogeneous within the groups treated 10 and 30 min after injury compared to the other groups. It appears that, according to the existing evidence, NMDA antagonists are an essential component in the elaboration of a neuroprotective strategy after spinal cord trauma.","amino_acids"

To determine the role of GLT1 in secondary cell loss following SCI, mice heterozygous for the GLT1 astrocyte glutamate transporter (GLT1(+/-)) and wild-type mice received thoracic crush SCI. Compared with wild-type controls, GLT1(+/-) mice had an attenuated recovery in hindlimb motor function, increased lesion size, and decreased tissue sparing.

Phrenic motoneurons express multiple serotonergic (5-HTR) and glutamatergic (GluR) receptors, but the timing and possible role of these different neurotransmitter receptor subtypes in the neuroplasticity following SH are not clear. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that there is an increased expression of serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors within phrenic motoneurons after SH. In adult male rats. phrenic motoneurons were labeled retrogradely by intrapleural injection of Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin B. In thin (10 mu m) frozen sections of the spinal cord. fluorescently-labeled phrenic motoneurons were visualized for laser capture microdissection (LCM). Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR in LCM samples, the time course of changes in 5-HTR and GluR mRNA expression was determined in phrenic motoneurons up to 21 days post-SH. Expression of 5-HTR subtypes 1b, 2a and 2c and GluR subtypes AMPA, NMDA, mGluR1 and mGluR5 was evident in phrenic motoneurons from control and SH rats. Phrenic motoneuron expression of 5-HTR2a increased similar to 8-fold (relative to control) at 14 days post-SH, whereas NMDA expression increased similar to 16-fold by 21-days post-SH. There were no other significant changes in receptor expression at any time post-SH. This is the first study to systematically document changes in motoneuron expression of multiple neurotransmitter receptors involved in regulation of motoneuron excitability. By providing information on the neuroplasticity of receptors expressed in a motoneuron pool that is inactivated by a higher-level spinal cord injury, appropriate pharmacological targets can be identified to alter motoneuron excitability.

(2) Do observed high interstitial concentrations or depletion of substances in the intracellular space by microdialysis affect release measurements upon spinal cord injury? Amino acid concentrations around microdialysis fibres in the spinal cord of rats were found to approach those in the circulation and to be much higher than interstitial concentrations previously estimated in the CNS. However, much lower concentrations of amino acids were derived in the hippocampus by analogous experiments. Considerable Evans Blue/albumin leaked from the circulation into the interstitial space in the spinal cord immediately after fibre insertion. However, this movement diminished considerably by 4 h later, demonstrating substantial resealing of the blood-brain barrier, at least to large molecules. There is either substantial damage-induced movement of amino acids from the circulation into the dialysis zone after insertion of a microdialysis probe, or there is much less impediment to movement of amino acids across the blood-brain barrier in the spinal cord than in the brain. At low flow rates through the fibre, adding concentrations of amino acids to the inside of the fibre equal to the concentrations around the fibre to prevent their depletion by removal through the microdialysis fibre did not affect increases in concentrations of amino acids in microdialysates following injury.","amino_acids"

Anatomical MRI findings were confirmed in histological spinal cord tissue preparations. In healthy spinal cord, gray and white matter were easily discerned in proton density-weighted images. An infield resolution of max. 76 mu m per pixel was achieved. In animals with chronic spinal cord transection changes in gray-white matter structure and contrast were observed toward the cut end, The spinal cord stumps showed a tapering off. This coincided with changes in the longitudinal/transverse ADC ratio.

Herein, we will review advances in the understanding of the role of several proteins of the UPS in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). The UPS consists of many factors that include E3 ubiquitin ligases, ubiquitin hydrolases, ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules, and the proteasome itself. An extensive body of work links UPS dysfunction with AD pathogenesis and progression. More recently, the UPS has been shown to have vital roles in recovery of function after SCI. The ubiquitin hydrolase (Uch-L1) has been proposed to increase cellular levels of mono-ubiquitin and hence to increase rates of protein turnover by the UPS. A low Uch-L1 level has been linked with A beta accumulation in AD and reduced neuroregeneration after SCI. One likely mechanism for these beneficial effects of Uch-L1 is reduced turnover of the PKA regulatory subunit and consequently, reduced signaling via CREB. The neuron-specific F-box protein Fbx2 ubiquitinates beta-secretase thus targeting it for proteasomal degradation and reducing generation of A beta. Both Uch-L1 and Fbx2 improve synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in mouse AD models. The role of Fbx2 after SCI has not been examined, but abolishing B-secretase reduces neuronal recovery after SCI, associated with reduced myelination. UBB(+)1, which arises through a frame-shift mutation in the ubiquitin gene that adds 19 amino acids to the C-terminus of ubiquitin, inhibits proteasomal function and is associated with increased neurofibrillary tangles in patients with AD, Pick's disease and Down's syndrome. These advances in understanding of the roles of the UPS in AD and SCI raise new questions but, also, identify attractive and exciting targets for potential, future therapeutic interventions.","amino_acids"

Coadministration of the vasodilator hydralazine substantially eliminated the paralytic, anaerobic metabolic and neuropathological responses to dynorphin A. In contrast, in concentrations up to 1 mM, dynorphin A did not alter the viability of cultured rat spinal cord neurons. Thus, it appears that this peptide lacks direct neurotoxic effects and that neuronal injuries in vivo result primarily from ischemia associated with dynorphin A-induced blood flow reductions. NMDA receptor antagonists significantly improved recovery from dynorphin A-induced hindlimb paralysis, and substantially eliminated neuropathological changes without attenuating the acute blood flow reductions or lactic acid elevations. Additionally, glutamate and aspartate concentrations were increased significantly in spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid samples removed during the time that peptide-induced spinal cord blood flow reductions were observed. In contrast, neither amino acid concentration was elevated in media removed after 1-hr exposure of spinal cord neuronal cell cultures to 100 mu M concentrations of dynorphin A.

Furthermore, a locomotor rating scale was developed by which the functional outcome of the spinal cord injury could be assessed. The introduction of such a model will be useful for further studies on the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of spinal cord injury. To assess hindlimb motor function, a 10-point. scale was used. Initially, the animals were allowed to move freely in an open field and were rated 0-5, 0 being no movement and 5 being almost normal. Animals scoring a 5 were then assessed using steel bars with decreasing widths from 2 cm to 5 mm. For each bar successfully crossed over, they gained additional points. Before injury the hindlimb motor function score (MFS) in all the animals was 10. In mice with mild compression, MFS was decreased slightly on day 1 and recovered to 9 +/- 0.6 on day 14. For mice with moderate compression, the MFS decreased to 4.6 +/- 0.4 on day 1 after injury and gradually improved to 8.1 +/- 0.6 on day 14. Severe injury resulted in paraplegia of the hindlimbs day 1 after injury with a score of 0.6 +/- 0.2. By day 14 after injury, these animals gradually recovered to 3.9 +/- 0.1, could bear the weight on the hindlimbs and walk with a severe deficit. There was a 3%, 9% and 19% decrease in the total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord 14 days after mild, moderate and severe injury, respectively. Microtubule-associated protein immunostaining revealed that the gray matter decreased to 61 +/- 7% in moderately injured animals, while severe compression resulted in a complete loss of gray matter. White matter decreased to 86 +/- 6% in moderately injured animals and 29 +/-11% in severely injured animals. This study shows that the mouse can be used to achieve reproducible spinal cord compression injuries of various degrees of severity. The force of the impact correlates well with the neurological and light microscopic outcome. The motor function test presented in this paper and the computerized quantification of tissue damage can be used to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment strategies.","amino_acids"

The influence of aquaporins (AQPs) in the balance of water distribution between intracranial compartments is getting much experimental support. The importance of AQPs in fluid clearance during vasogenic brain edema seems well established but their role in cytotoxic swelling and in brain cell shrinkage is not known in detail. The main AQPs function as water channels anticipates their influence on cell volume changes as well as on the mechanisms of volume recovery, which include notably the osmolyte translocation across the cell membrane. Osmolyte fluxes permit the reestablishment of an osmotic balance and volume recovery in anisosmotic-elicited cell volume changes, but are also causal factors per se of brain cell swelling or shrinkage in pathological situations. This review aims to inform on the so far described functional interactions between AQPs and osmolyte fluxes and their volume-sensitive pathways. It also points to the coincidence of AQPs and activation of osmolyte fluxes in physiological and pathological conditions and to the importance of finding possible functional links between these two events, thus enlarging the possibilities via AQP manipulations, to prevent the adverse consequences of cell volume changes in brain.

However, these differences between 17 beta-estradiol-treated and control rats disappeared after 4 weeks. These results suggest that 17 beta-estradiol protects the spinal cord by stimulating early cytokines release and astroglial responses. These stimulations may prevent the area of damage from expanding and inflammatory cells to spread in the surrounding tissue during the critical first week following SCI. Although transient, these effects improved the locomotor recovery that was sustained over 4 weeks after injury. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","amino_acids"

A dorsal column segment was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, maintained in vitro, and injured by compression for 15 sec with a clip having a 2g closing force. Under control conditions after SCI, the compound action potential (CAP) amplitude was reduced to 69.1 +/- 5.4% of baseline. Blockade of group I mGluR receptors with MCPG, 4CPG, or AIDA resulted in improved recovery of CAP amplitude (82.2 +/- 2.0%, 86.2 +/- 3.9%, and 86.0 +/- 2.5% of baseline, respectively). The group I/II agonist trans-ACPD and selective group I agonist DHPG exacerbated the posttraumatic reduction of CAP amplitude. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 improved recovery of CAP amplitude after traumatic spinal cord axonal injury. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of mGluR1 alpha-immunopositive astrocytes and the absence of mGluR5 in spinal cord white matter. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of group I mGluR receptors after SCI exacerbates posttraumatic axonal injury through a phospholipase C dependent mechanism, The presence of mGluR1 alpha labeling on astrocytes suggests a role for these cells in the pathophysiology of SCI. Additional studies in vivo, are required to further clarify the role of mGluRs in acute traumatic SCI.","amino_acids"

Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole - after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), plienytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p < 0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na+ blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","amino_acids"

In this study, the spinal cord of rats was damaged by a contusive method and the animals were treated by saline or 1 mg/kg of Gacyclidine i.v., 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after injury. The time-course of the motor score was evaluated on days 1, 7 and 18 after injury, and somatosensory evoked potentials were determined on day 20. The animals were then killed and the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord (at the epicenter of the injury, above and below the injury), was measured. Walking recovery was better (P<0.0125) in the group treated 10 min after injury than in the untreated injured animals after 18 days of injury. Motor performances were related to the preservation of a larger undamaged area of spinal cord at the level of the injury (P<0.0125). Somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes were also higher in this group. These results confirm that Gacyclidine attenuates spinal cord damage after an experimental spinal cord lesion. Recovery was better within the group treated 10 min after injury compared with the other groups, which certainly confirms that the acute time-course of glutamate release requires rapid pharmacological intervention to achieve good results.

Furthermore, we provide a brief overview of TMS studies to date. Main findings: We describe the rationale for the use of these techniques in TBI, discuss their possible mechanisms of action, and raise a number of considerations relevant to translation of these methods to clinical use. Depending on the stimulation parameters, NBS may enable suppression of the acute glutamatergic hyperexcitability following TBI and/or counter the excessive GABAergic effects in the subacute stage. In the chronic stage, brain stimulation coupled to rehabilitation may enhance behavioral recovery, learning of new skills, and cortical plasticity. Correlative animal models and comprehensive safety trials seem critical to establish the use of these modalities in TBI. Conclusions: Different forms of NBS techniques harbor the promise of diagnostic and therapeutic utility, particularly to guide processes of cortical reorganization and enable functional restoration in TBI.

Over the last 100 years researchers have found that the spinal cord is also capable of supporting other forms of plasticity including several forms of learning. To study instrumental (response-outcome) learning in the spinal cord, we use a preparation in which spinally transected rats are given shock to the hind leg when the leg is extended. The spinal cord rapidly learns to hold the leg in a flexed position when given this controllable shock. However, if shock is independent of leg position (uncontrollable shock), subjects fail to learn. Uncontrollable shock also impairs future learning. As little as 6 min of uncontrollable shock to either the leg or the tail generates a learning deficit that lasts up to 48 h. Recent data suggest links between the learning deficit and the sensitization of pain circuits associated with inflammation or injury (central sensitization). Here, we explored whether central sensitization and the spinal learning deficit share pharmacological and behavioral features. Central sensitization enhances reactivity to mechanical stimulation (allodynia) and depends on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). The uncontrollable shock stimulus that generates a learning deficit produced a tactile allodynia (Exp. 1) and administration of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 blocked induction of the learning deficit (Exp. 2). Finally, a treatment known to induce central sensitization, intradermal carrageenan, produced a spinal learning deficit (Exp. 3).

Focal microinjection experiments have demonstrated that 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f) quinoxaline (NBQX), a highly selective and potent antagonist of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate ionotropic EAA receptors, i.e., those preferring alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) or kainate, can reduce histopathology and functional deficits when administered at 15 min after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Similarly, intravenous infusion of NBQX, beginning at 15 min postinjury (p.i.), results in a significant amelioration of the functional deficits produced by experimental SCI. However, if antagonists of AMPA/kainate receptors were to be used therapeutically for patients with SCI, administration would likely be delayed for several hours after injury. We therefore examined the effects of NBQX administered at 4 h after SCI on functional deficits and histopathology in a standardized rat model of contusive SCI. An incomplete SCI was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats at T8 with a weight-drop device (10 g x 2.5 cm). NBQX (15 nmol), or vehicle alone, was microinjected into the injury site 4 h later Recovery of hind limb reflexes, postural control, and locomotor function was determined by a battery of behavioral tests performed for 8 weeks. Spinal cord tissue was then fixed by perfusion and used for morphometric and immunocytochemical analyses. Previous studies with acute NBQX treatment showed significant functional improvement by 1 week; the effects of delayed NBQX treatment on functional deficits were not discernible until 3-4 weeks after SCI. Thereafter, significant reductions in hindlimb deficits were demonstrated in two independent studies. The nature and magnitude of the reductions in chronic deficits were similar to those observed previously when NBQX was administered acutely at 15 min after SCI. Morphometric analyses showed that delayed treatment with NBQX resulted in sparing of gray matter adjacent to the injury site but no significant effect on the area of white matter at the epicenter. However, serotonin immunoreactivity below the lesion, used as a marker for preservation of one supraspinal pathway, was significantly higher in the NBQX-treated group. These results support a therapeutic potential for NBQX, and presumably other AMPA antagonists, in SCI by demonstrating effectiveness in a clinically relevant time frame. They indicate the importance of assessing chronic functional deficits in evaluating the therapeutic potential of a treatment paradigm. Further, they suggest the intriguing hypothesis that mechanisms underlying early functional recovery after SCI are, at least in part, distinct those from those involved in reducing chronic functional deficits.

Preventive measures are highly recommended to reduce the risk and number of TBI cases. The primary injury to the brain initiates a secondary injury process that spreads via multiple molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of TBI. The events leading to both neurodegeneration and functional recovery after TBI are generalized into four categories: (i) primary injury that disrupts brain tissues; (ii) secondary injury that causes pathophysiology in the brain; (iii) inflammatory response that adds to neurodegeneration; and (iv) repair-regeneration that may contribute to neuronal repair and regeneration to some extent following TBI. Destructive multiple mediators of the secondary injury process ultimately dominate over a few intrinsic protective measures, leading to activation of cysteine proteases such as calpain and caspase-3 that cleave key cellular substrates and cause cell death. Experimental studies in rodent models of TBI suggest that treatment with calpain inhibitors (e.g., AK295, SJA6017) and neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGF, BDNF) can prevent neuronal death and dysfunction in TBI. Currently, there is still no precise therapeutic strategy for the prevention of pathogenesis and neurodegeneration following TBI in humans.

These extremely debilitating conditions are major contributors to morbidity. Our understanding of SCI has certainly increased during the last decade, but remains far from clear. SCI consists of two defined phases: the initial impact causes primary injury, which is followed by a prolonged secondary injury consisting of evolving sub-phases that may last for years. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms driving this condition are complex. Derangement of the vasculature is a notable feature of the pathology of SCI. In particular, an important component of SCI is the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) that leads to endothelial dysfunction and changes in vascular permeability. Indeed, together with endothelial cell damage and failure in homeostasis, ischemia reperfusion injury triggers full-blown inflammatory cascades arising from activation of residential innate immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) and infiltrating leukocytes (neutrophils and macrophages). These inflammatory cells release neurotoxins (proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, free radicals, excitotoxic amino acids, nitric oxide (NO)), all of which partake in axonal and neuronal deficit. Therefore, our review considers the recent advances in SCI mechanisms, whereby it becomes clear that SCI is a heterogeneous condition. Hence, this leads towards evidence of a restorative approach based on monotherapy with multiple targets or combinatorial treatment. Moreover, from evaluation of the existing literature, it appears that there is an urgent requirement for multi-centered, randomized trials for a large patient population. These clinical studies would offer an opportunity in stratifying SCI patients at high risk and selecting appropriate, optimal therapeutic regimens for personalized medicine.","amino_acids"

Little is currently known about the molecular basis for such recovery, but the increased trophic activity in injured CNS tissue and the known properties of neurotrophic factors in neuronal growth and maintenance suggest that these polypeptides are probably involved in recovery of function. Members of the neurotrophin family, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), are capable of supporting survival of injured CNS neurons both in vitro and in vivo. They also stimulate neurite outgrowth, needed for reorganization of the injured CNS, and the expression of key enzymes for neurotransmitter synthesis that may need to be upregulated to compensate for reduced innervation. The effects of the neurotrophins are mediated through specific high affinity trk receptors (trk A, B, C) as well as a common low affinity receptor designated p75(NGFR). Another class of neurotrophic polypeptides also provides candidate recovery-promoting molecules, the heparin-binding growth factors' acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, bFGF). FGFs not only sustain survival of injured neurons but also stimulate revascularization and certain glial responses to injury. Both the neurotrophins and the FGFs, as well as their respective receptors, have been shown to be upregulated after experimental CNS injury. Further, administration of neurotrophins or FGF has been shown to reduce the effects of experimental injury induced by axotomy, excitotoxins, and certain other neurotoxins.

Because of the critical role of Ca2+ ions in regulating innumerable cellular functions, this major homeostatic disturbance is thought to trigger neuronal and axonal degeneration and produce clinical disability. We review those aspects of normal and pathological Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons that relate to neurodegeneration and to the application of neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of CNS injury.

The sharpest peak of MPO activity was localized between 4 mm rostral and caudal to the injury. Macrophages/microglia were visualized with antibodies against ED1 and OX-42. Numerous cells with a phagocytic morphology were present by 24 h, with a higher number by 48 h. These cells were predominantly located within the gray matter and dorsal funiculus white matter. The number of cells gradually declined through 6 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion. OX-42 staining also revealed reactive microglia with blunt processes, particularly at levels distant to the lesion. The number of macrophages/microglia was significantly correlated with the amount of tissue damage at each level. Treatments to decrease the inflammatory response are likely to be beneficial to recovery of function after traumatic spinal cord injury. (C) 1998 Academic Press.","amino_acids"

Here we report that broad regions of the peritraumatic zone are characterized by a sustained process of pathologic, high ATP release. Spinal cord neurons expressed P2X7 purine receptors (P2X7R), and exposure to ATP led to high-frequency spiking, irreversible increases in cytosolic calcium and cell death. To assess the potential effect of P2X7R blockade in ameliorating acute spinal cord injury (SCI), we delivered P2X7R antagonists OxATP or PPADS to rats after acute impact injury. We found that both OxATP and PPADS significantly improved functional recovery and diminished cell death in the peritraumatic zone. These observations demonstrate that SCI is associated with prolonged purinergic receptor activation, which results in excitotoxicity-based neuronal degeneration. P2X7R antagonists inhibit this process, reducing both the histological extent and functional sequelae of acute SCI.","amino_acids"

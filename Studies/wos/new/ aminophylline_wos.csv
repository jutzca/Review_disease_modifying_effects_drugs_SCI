Systemically administered theophylline activates a functionally latent crossed phrenic pathway (CPP) which decussates caudal to the hemisection and activates phrenic motoneurons ipsilateral to the hemisection. The result is return of function to the paralyzed hemidiaphragm. Unfortunately, in humans, systemically administered theophylline at a therapeutic dose produces many unwanted side effects.","aminophylline"

Although theophylline had been used clinically in the treatment of various pulmonary diseases, its effects on respiratory muscle function in cervical spinal cord injured tetraplegics has not been studied. In the present case study, we evaluated a patient injured in 1979 with a chronic asymmetric C5-7 tetraplegia (left C5-6, right C6-7) before and alter receiving theophylline chronically by mouth for three weeks and again before and after receiving acute intravenous (IV) aminophylline after the effects of the chronic drug administration wore off. Neural activation to inspiratory muscles was assessed by right and left parasternal intercostal and diaphragm EMGs during quiet breathing and maximal inspiratory efforts. Global respiratory drive was assessed by P-100, and inspiratory muscle force was assessed by maximal inspiratory pressures and vital capacity. Both long-term orally administered and acute IV theophylline increased neural activation to the diaphragm, especially on the more affected left aide. Theophylline treatment was also associated with an increase in global central respiratory drive and inspiratory muscle force, without changing expiratory airflows. Left diaphragm EMG activity was markedly increased following the administration of theophylline. Of interest, upper parasternal intercostal EMG activity was also recruited on the left in spite of being below the level of cervical injury. We speculate that the administration of theophylline in selected patients with an asymmetric cervical spinal cord injury may activate latent bulbospinal respiratory pathways and improve inspiratory muscle function, reducing the likelihood of associated respiratory failure.","aminophylline"

IV aminophylline was administered in increasing doses (2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 6 mg/kg) over the course of 1 day. Diaphragm surface electromyography (sEMG), measures of respiration (tidal volume, minute ventilation, and frequency), and serum theophylline levels were captured. Diaphragm sEMG activity increased by a maximum of 50% at therapeutic levels. The rapid shallow breathing index dropped from 112 to 86. The subject was successfully weaned from ventilatory support. We conclude that administration of aminophylline facilitated weaning from ventilatory support in this tetraplegic patient.","aminophylline"

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A(1) adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine Al receptors. Theophylline induced, and maintained, hemidiaphragmatic recovery for prolonged periods after C(2) spinal cord hemisection in rats and may prove to be beneficial in assisting respiration in spinal cord injury patients.","aminophylline"

The absence of respiratory-related activity in the left phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm of rats subjected to an ipsilateral C2 spinal cord hemisection was confirmed electrophysiologically 24 h after injury. Theophylline was then injected i.p. for 3-30 consecutive days. Recovery of respiratory-related activity was observed in the majority (29 out of 32) of the experimental animals.

There were three separate groups of spinal hemisected rats and one nonhemisected group studied. Twenty-four hours following C2 spinal hemisection, ipsilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded under standardized, normoxic and then hypoxic conditions. After 30 min, theophylline was administered and the recordings were repeated in group 1 animals. In group 2, activity in both phrenic nerves was recorded simultaneously before and after drug administration. In a third group of rats, both ipsilateral phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragmatic activities were monitored before and after the drug. In control nonhemisected animals under standardized recording conditions, the effects of theophylline were quantitatively assessed by determining the mean area under integrated phrenic nerve discharge waveforms before and after drug administration. Generally, theophylline induced biphasic effects; i.e., at a low dose (15 mg/kg) it evoked excitation, while at a high dose (30 mg/kg) depression of respiratory activity predominated. In group 2 animals, respiratory activity was induced in the nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve for up to 3 h after a single standard dose of theophylline (15 mg/kg). Prior to drug administration, there was an absence of respiratory-related activity in both the phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to C2 spinal cord hemisection. A standard dose of theophylline, however, induced recovery of activity in both the phrenic nerve and the left hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection in group 3 animals. In control (nonhemisected) animals, theophylline enhanced phrenic nerve activity, but decreased the duration of respiratory bursts. These results show for the first time that theophylline can activate latent respiratory motor pathways and thus restore the respiratory drive to phrenic motoneurons lost by spinal cord injury. Respiratory activity is not only reestablished in the phrenic nerve made quiescent by hemisection, but it is also enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve. The drug also restores function to the hemidiaphragm paralyzed by the spinal cord hemisection. The findings may have clinical relevance to human cases of cervical spinal cord injury in which respiratory function is compromised. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.","aminophylline"

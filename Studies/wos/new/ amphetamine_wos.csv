The strong link between dopamine and motor learning has been well-established in the animal literature with similar findings reported in healthy adults and the elderly. Objective. We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. Methods. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. Results. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. Conclusions. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.","amphetamine"

Here, we investigated whether this same drug/training regimen could enhance functional recovery following either thoracic (T9) or cervical (C5) spinal cord injury. Different groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a beam walking task, and in a straight alley for assessment of hindlimb locomotor recovery using the BBB locomotor scale. For rats that received C5 hemisections, forelimb grip strength was assessed using a grip strength meter. Three separate experiments assessed the consequences of training rats on the beam walking task 24 h following a thoracic lateral hemisection with administration of either amphetamine or saline. Beginning 1 h following drug administration, rats either received additional testing/retraining on the beam hourly for 6 h, or they were returned to their home cages without further testing/retraining. Rats with thoracic spinal cord injuries that received amphetamine in conjunction with testing/retraining on the beam at 1 day post injury (DPI) exhibited significantly impaired recovery on the beam walking task and BBB. Rats with cervical spinal cord injuries that received training with amphetamine also exhibited significant impairments in beam walking and locomotion, as well as impairments in gripping and reaching abilities. Even when administered at 14 DPI, the drug/training regimen significantly impaired reaching ability in cervical spinal cord injured rats. Impairments were not seen in rats that received amphetamine without training. Histological analyses revealed that rats that received training with amphetamine had significantly larger lesions than saline controls. These data indicate that an amphetamine/training regimen that improves recovery after cortical injury has the opposite effect of impairing recovery following spinal cord injury because early training with amphetamine increases lesion severity.

Here, we tested amphetamine (AMPH)-enhanced skilled motor training following a unilateral C3-C4 contusion injury on the qualitative components of reaching and on skilled forelimb function, as assessed using single-pellet and staircase reaching tasks. Kinematic analysis evaluated the quality of the reach, and unskilled locomotor function was also tested. Animals receiving AMPH and skilled forelimb training performed better than operated control animals on qualitative reaching, but not on skilled reaching. Those that received the combination treatment and were housed in EE cages showed significantly less improvement in qualitative reaching and grasping. Kinematic analysis revealed a decrease in digit abduction during skilled reaching among all groups, with no differences among groups. Kinematics provided no evidence that improved function was related to improved quality of reach. There was no evidence of neuroprotection in the cervical spinal cord. The absence of evidence for kinematic improvement or neuroprotection suggested that AMPH-enhanced motor training is due primarily to supraspinal effects, an enhancement of attention during skilled motor training, or plasticity in supraspinal circuitry involved with motor control.","amphetamine"

While cellular pathology was evaluated in terms of spinal cord histology and profile of astrocytes following immunolabeling with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), locomotor recovery was monitored using hindlimb motor function scoring system. At 24 h post-SCI, there was a massive loss of motor function and cysts formation in the spinal cord. The SCI mice, following 3 days and onwards, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the population and hypertrophy of GFAP + astrocytes, suggesting the occurrence of reactive astrogliosis. Intra-fourth ventricular administration of CART (54-102) or intravenous treatment with MP, dose dependently improved motor function score, while CART-antibody (intra-fourth ventricular) was ineffective. This neuroprotective effect of MP was potentiated by the subeffective dose of CART and antagonized by CART-antibody. CART or MP treatment not only prevented the cysts formation, but also significantly attenuated the population of GFAP + astrocytes at days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-SCI and the hypertrophy of astrocytes at day 14 and 28. The histological consequence of SCI, like cysts formation in the spinal cord, was rapidly improved by CART and/or MP. Taken together, the data suggest that CART may exert its neuroprotective effect via inhibition of post-SCI astrogliosis and participate in the MP mediated neuroprotection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate if, like 5HT, endogenous sources of norepinephrine (NE) facilitate motoneuron PICs after chronic spinal transection. Cutaneous-evoked reflex responses in tail muscles of awake chronic spinal rats were measured after increasing presynaptic release of NE by administration of amphetamine. An increase in long-lasting reflexes, known to be mediated by the calcium component of the PIC (CaPIC), was observed even at low doses (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) of amphetamine. These findings were repeated in a reduced S2 in vitro preparation, demonstrating that the increased long-lasting reflexes by amphetamine were neural. Under intracellular voltage clamp, amphetamine application led to a large facilitation of the motoneuron CaPIC. This indicates that the increases in long-lasting reflexes induced by amphetamine in the awake animal were, in part, due to actions directly on the motoneuron. Reflex responses in acutely spinal animals were facilitated by amphetamine similar to chronic animals but only at doses that were ten times greater than that required in chronic animals (0.2 mg/kg chronic vs. 2.0 mg/kg acute), pointing to a development of supersensitivity to endogenous NE in chronic animals. In summary, the increases in long-lasting reflexes and associated motoneuron CaPICs by amphetamine are likely due to an increased release of endogenous NE, which motoneurons become supersensitive to in the chronic stages of spinal cord injury.","amphetamine"

Studies using fixed tissue have suggested that serotonin neurons might be a notable exception, but remain inconclusive. We have employed in vivo two-photon microscopy to produce time-lapse images of serotonin axons in the neocortex of the adult mouse. Serotonin axons undergo massive retrograde degeneration following amphetamine treatment and subsequent slow recovery of axonal density, which is dominated by new growth with little contribution from local sprouting. A stab injury that transects serotonin axons running in the neocortex is followed by local regression of cut serotonin axons and followed by regrowth from cut ends into and across the stab rift zone. Regrowing serotonin axons do not follow the pathways left by degenerated axons. The regrown axons release serotonin and their regrowth is correlated with recovery in behavioral tests.","amphetamine"

Olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) express a variety of growth factors and cell adhesion molecules and promote axonal regrowth and functional recovery in spinal cord injury in animal models and patients. In the present study, we explored the possibility to increase the survival, function, axonal outgrowth and striatal reinnervation of NSC by co-grafting with OEC in 6-OHDA lesioned parkinsonian rats. In the presence of OEC, significantly enhanced survival of NSC-derived DA neurons and axonal fiber outgrowth was evident in the striatum of NSC+OEC co-grafted rats at 24 weeks post-grafting as compared with NSC alone grafted rats. The increased survival of NSC and their striatal reinnervation was further manifested in the form of significant and substantial restitution of motor function and neurochemical recovery in the co-grafted group. Significant enhanced expression of p75NTR (from OEC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (from NSC) confirmed the co-localization and survival of both types of cells at the transplantation site in co-grafted rats. Co-grafting results co-related well with our in vitro studies, which suggest that OEC not only significantly increase survival, neurite outgrowth and DA release of NSC-derived DA neuron but also protect against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity in co-culture conditions. These results collectively suggest that OEC increase the survival and function of transplanted NSC in 6-OHDA lesioned parkinsonian rats.","amphetamine"

The purpose of this study was to investigate if OEC enhance the effects of grafted dopamine-neuron-rich ventral mesencephalic tissue (VM) in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease. We co-grafted VM with either OEC or astrocytes derived from the same olfactory bulbs as the OEC to rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal system. Co-grafting fetal VM with OEC, but not with astrocytes enhanced dopamine cell survival, striatal reinnervation and functional recovery of amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour compared with grafting embryonic VM alone. Grafting OEC or astrocytes alone had no effects. Intriguingly, only in the presence of OEC co-grafts, did dopamine neurons extend strikingly long neurites that reached peripheral striatal compartments. Comparable results were observed in a co-culture system where OEC promoted dopamine cell survival and neurite elongation through a mechanism involving both releasable factors and direct contact. Cell type analysis of fetal VM grafts suggested that dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra rather than of the ventral tegmental area were increased in the presence of OEC co-grafts. We conclude that the addition of OEC enhances efficacy of grafted immature dopamine neurons in a rat Parkinson's disease model.","amphetamine"

The therapeutic potential of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), the most potent neurotrophic factor for DA neurons, has been demonstrated in many experimental models of PD. However, chronic delivery of GDNF to DA neurons in the brain remains an unmet challenge. Here, we report the effects of GDNF-releasing Notch-induced human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) grafted into striatum of the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) progressively lesioned rat model of PD. Human MSC, obtained from bone marrow aspirates of young, healthy adult volunteers, were transiently transfected with the intracellular domain of the Notch1 gene (NICD) to generate SB623 cells. SB623 cells expressing GDNF and/or humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) following lentiviral transduction or nontransduced cells were stereotaxically placed into rat striatum 1 week after a unilateral partial 6-OHDA striatal lesion. At 4 weeks, rats that had received GDNF-transduced SB623 cells had significantly decreased amphetamine-induced rotation compared with control rats, although this effect was not observed in rats that received GFP-transduced or nontransduced SB623 cells. At 5 weeks, rejuvenated tyrosine hydroxylase-imnnunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers that appeared to be host DA axons were observed in and around grafts. This effect was more prominent in rats that received GDNF-secreting cells and was not observed in controls. These observations suggest that human bone-marrow derived MSC, genetically modified to secrete GDNF, hold potential as an allogeneic or autologous stem cell therapy for PD.

Subsequently, at 24 h after the lesion, the rats were forced to run on the treadmill (5 days/week, 30 min/day, 11 m/min). As behavioral evaluations, cylinder test was performed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and amphetamine-induced rotational test was per-formed at 2 and 4 weeks with consequent euthanasia for immunohistochemical investigations. The exercise group showed better behavioral recovery in cylinder test and significant decrease in the number of amphetamine-induced rotations, compared to the non-exercise group. Correspondingly, significant preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers in the striatum and TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was demonstrated, compared to the non-exercise group. Additionally, the number of migrated BrdU- and Doublecortin-positive cells toward the lesioned striatum was increased in the exercise group.

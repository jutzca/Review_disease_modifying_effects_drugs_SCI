Like other neurones in the central nervous system, RGC are not able to regenerate their damaged axons spontaneously. We used special surgical methods and pharmacological measures to achieve enhanced survival and regeneration of damaged RGC. Materials and Methods: Studies were performed using the model of RGC degeneration induced by severing the optic nerve of adult rats. RGC were loaded with a fluorescent dye, and several drugs were applied intravitreally. The effects were evaluated after two weeks by counting the surviving RGC. For regeneration studies, an autologous peripheral nerve graft was sutured to the stump of the cut optic nerve, or the ends of the cut optic nerve were re-sutured. Recovery of RGC function was assessed by VEP measurements. Results: The number of RGC surviving an axotomy increased significantly after intravitreal injections of aurintricarboxylic acid, cortisol, a caspase inhibitor, brimonidine or microglia-targeted substances. Regeneration of cut axons was enhanced by aurintricarboxylic acid or cortisol. In addition, considerable neuroprotective and regenerative effects including partial restoration of VEP were induced by lens injury, which results in a gradual release of crystallins into the vitreous, or by intravitreal injection of purified crystallins. Conclusion: The loss of vision after an optic nerve trauma can be reduced in this animal model by suitable neuroprotective measures, which raises hope for the treatment of patients.","brimonidine"

Chronic spinal cord injury may be complicated by weight loss, muscle atrophy, and bone loss. Objective. The authors identified a combination pharmacotherapy using buspirone, carbidopa, and L-DOPA (BCD) that elicits bouts of locomotor-like movements in spinal cord-transected (Tx) mice. They then evaluated the effects of 8 weeks of treadmill training in Tx mice that received BCD or BCD + clenbuterol, a monoaminergic agent with anabolic properties, on locomotor function, muscle atrophy, adipose tissue loss, and bone density measures. Methods. Induced locomotor movement, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and femoral bone properties were compared in unoperated control mice, operated controls (untreated, untrained Tx mice), and 2 groups of treated, trained Tx mice (Tx + BCD, Tx + BCD + clenbuterol) that also received training. Results. BCD-and BCD + clenbuterol-treated mice showed comparable levels of locomotor movements that significantly improved over time. Soleus muscle mass and soleus and extensor digitorum longus cross-sectional area significantly increased in both groups of BCD-treated mice, with greater effects in BCD + clenbuterol-treated animals. Fiber type conversion, adipose tissues, bone mineral density, and content were reduced in all Tx groups compared with unoperated control mice. Conclusion. These findings suggest that locomotor movement and muscle properties can be restored to near-normal levels after several weeks of BCD treatment, regular training, and clenbuterol in completely paraplegic animals.","carbidopa"

We conducted proof-of-concept experiments aimed at assessing efficacy upon oral administration of a novel combination therapy for central pattern generator (CPG) activation and corresponding locomotor movement generation in completely paraplegic animals. Co-administration orally (by gavage) of buspirone, levodopa and carbidopa was found to dose-dependently induce episodes of steady weight-bearing stepping in low-thoracic (Th9/10) spinal cord-transected (Tx) mice (with no other form of assistance or training). Robust hindlimb stepping with weight-bearing capabilities was induced with the tri-therapy but not with clinically relevant doses of these compounds administered separately. These results provide evidence suggesting that this drug combination may be ideally suited to constitute a first-in-class therapy (CPG activator) for locomotor activity induction in chronic SCI individuals, given that efficacy was shown using commercially available brain-permeable small molecules, already known as safe for the treatment of various neurological indications.","carbidopa"

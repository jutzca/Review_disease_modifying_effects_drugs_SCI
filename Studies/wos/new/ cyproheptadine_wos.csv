Little is known about the role of 5-HT receptors in the control of voluntary locomotion, so we administered inverse agonists of 5-HT2 (Cyproheptadine; Cypr), 5-HT2A neutral antagonist (Volinanserin; Volin), 5-HT2C neutral antagonist (SB 242084), and 5-HT2B/2C inverse agonist (SB 206553) receptors intrathecally in intact rats and monitored their effects on unrestrained locomotion. An intrathecal cannula was introduced at the low thoracic level and pushed caudally until the tip reached the L2/L3 or L5/L6 spinal segments. Locomotor performance was evaluated using EMG activity of hindlimb muscles during locomotion on a 2 m long runway. Motoneuron excitability was estimated using EMG recordings during dorsi- and plantar flexion at the ankle. Locomotion was dramatically impaired after the blockage of 5-HT2A receptors. The effect of Cypr was more pronounced than that of Volin since in the L5/L6 rats Cypr (but not Volin) induced significant alteration of the strength of interlimb coordination followed by total paralysis. These agents significantly decreased locomotor EMG amplitude and abolished or substantially decreased stretch reflexes. Blocking 5-HT2B/2C receptors had no effect either on locomotion or reflexes. We suggest that in intact rats serotonin controls timing and amplitude of muscle activity by acting on 5-HT2A receptors on both CPG interneurons and motoneurons, while 5-HT2B/2C receptors are not involved in control of the locomotor pattern in lumbar spinal cord.","cyproheptadine"

Several strategies have been used to activate spinal cord circuitry independent of the higher centers, including direct electrical stimulation, pharmacological agents, and training programs that involve moving the legs through the motions of walking. Ambulatory leg movements are achieved by these interventions, leading to substantial functional improvements in the subset of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury. The neurobiological basis for these phenomena likely involves activity-dependent reconfiguration of synaptic connections within the spinal cord. Fostering this process may lead to further benefits for individuals with spinal cord injury.","cyproheptadine"

While medications and physical rehabilitation are prescribed to alleviate spastic symptoms, the insufficiency of their effects remains an important problem to be addressed. Given the challenges associated with increasing the dose of medication, we hypothesized that a combination therapy with medication and physical rehabilitation can be effective. Therefore, we examined the effects of treadmill training (TMT) along with serotonergic medication using a spastic rat model after contusive injury. Spasticity-strong SCI rats were selected 4 weeks after SCI and received one of the following interventions for 2 weeks: only TMT, TMT with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), TMT with cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist), only fluoxetine, or only cyproheptadine. We performed the swimming test to quantify the frequency of spastic behaviors. We also evaluated hindlimb locomotor functions every week. At the end of the intervention, we examined the Hoffman reflex from the plantar muscle and the immunoreactivity of the 5-HT2A receptor in spinal cord tissues. While the TMT group and cyproheptadine-treated groups showed decreased spastic behaviors and reduction in spinal hyperreflexia, the fluoxetine-treated group showed the opposite effect, even with TMT. Moreover, TMT suppressed the expression of the 5-HT2A receptor in the lumbar spinal motor neurons, while cyproheptadine treatment did not change it. We did not observe any differences in locomotor functions between the groups. Taken together, our findings indicate that TMT and cyproheptadine significantly alleviated spastic symptoms, but did not show synergistic or additive effects.","cyproheptadine"

Human and animal models suggest that disruption of endogenous monoaminergic input, particularly serotonin (5-HT), from supraspinal centers contributes to this impaired motor function following SCI. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 5-HT medications on motor function in individuals with chronic (> 1 year) SCI. Clinical measures of strength, spasticity/spasms, and walking ability were assessed in 12 individuals with chronic incomplete SCI following acute administration of either 8 mg cyproheptadine, a 5-HT antagonist, or 10 mg escitalopram, a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), in a double-blinded, randomized, crossover fashion. Results indicated that 5-HT medications modulated both volitional and reflexive behaviors with little change in walking performance; 5-HT antagonist medications depressed clinical measures of strength and spasticity/spasms, whereas SSRIs augmented both strength and spasticity/spasms. These changes are consistent with the dysregulation of 5-HT sensitive spinal neurons following SCI. This understanding may augment clinicians' awareness of the motor consequences of 5-HT medications.","cyproheptadine"

Loss of descending serotonergic (5HT) input to spinal circuits is thought to contribute to motor impairments, with enhanced motor function demonstrated through augmentation of 5HT signaling. However, the presence of spastic motor behaviors in SCI is attributed, in part, to changes in spinal 5HT receptors that augment their activity in the absence of 5HT, although data demonstrating motor effects of 5HT agents that deactivate these receptors are conflicting. The effects of enhancement or depression of 5HT signaling on locomotor function have not been thoroughly evaluated in human iSCI. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate acute effects of 5HT medications on locomotion in 10 subjects with chronic (>1 year) iSCI. Peak overground and treadmill locomotor performance, including measures of gait kinematics, electromyographic (EMG) activity, and oxygen consumption, were assessed before and after single-dose administration of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a 5HT antagonist using a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over design. Results indicate that neither medication led to improvements in locomotion, with a significant decrease in peak overground gait speed observed after 5HT antagonists (from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 m/s; p = 0.01). Additionally, 5-HT medications had differential effects on EMG activity, with 5HT antagonists decreasing extensor activity and SSRIs increasing flexor activity. Our data therefore suggest that acute manipulation of 5HT signaling, despite changes in muscle activity, does not improve locomotor performance after iSCI.","cyproheptadine"

In addition, it allows interaction with therapists and others to facilitate locomotion control, particularly during the early stages of gait therapy. Neurobiological bases for this technique and early clinical results are discussed, and two case studies of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are presented.

Spinal cord injury was produced at T-10 by the weight-drop method and confirmed by the disappearance of the somatosensory-evoked response during the subsequent 15 minutes. In all experiments, drug or vehicle treatments were randomly administered as a single intravenous bolus 15 minutes after injury. Functional outcome was blindly assessed for 2 weeks after injury using a modified Tarlov scale, and in some cases, the Rivlin-Tator angleboard test. The survival of descending raphe-spinal axons was determined by the measurement of serotonin in postmortem spinal tissues located above and below the site of injury. In separate acute experiments, the physiological and hemodynamic correlates of a 50 gm cm injury and either mianserin or vehicle injection were examined, as were the effects on serotonin content and metabolism in spinal tissues harvested 30 minutes after injury. All doses of mianserin were associated with some index of improved recovery following a 50 gm cm injury, with a 1-mg/kg dose being clearly superior. Both ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (2 mg/kg) displayed marginal therapeutic actions for 50 gm cm injuries. In acute studies, mianserin at 1 mg/kg was associated with the preservation of posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow at T-12 as well as a pronounced alteration in postmortem spinal serotonin content and metabolism, in contrast to vehicle control treatments. These data lend further support to a serotonergic hypothesis of secondary spinal cord injury and suggest the potential use of mianserin for the acute treatment of spinal cord injury.","cyproheptadine"

First published December 5, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00821.2012.-In animals, the recovery of motoneuron excitability in the months following a complete spinal cord injury is mediated, in part, by increases in constitutive serotonin (5-HT2) and norepinephrine (alpha(1)) receptor activity, which facilitates the reactivation of calcium-mediated persistent inward currents (CaPICs) without the ligands serotonin and norepinephrine below the injury. In this study we sought evidence for a similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine, which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/alpha(1) receptor activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury, facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and alpha(1) receptor activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity, especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.","cyproheptadine"

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of pharmacological agents on gait in people with SCI. A keyword literature search of articles that evaluated the effects of drugs on walking after SCI was performed using the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and hand searching. Two reviewers independently evaluated each study, using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) tool for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and the modified Downs & Black scale for all other studies. Results were tabulated and levels of evidence were assigned. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. One RCT provided Level 1 evidence that GM-1 ganglioside in combination with physical therapy improved motor scores, walking velocity, and distance better than placebo and physical therapy in persons with incomplete SCI. Multiple studies (levels of evidence 1-5) showed that clonidine and cyproheptadine may improve locomotor function and walking speed in severely impaired individuals with incomplete SCI. Gains in walking speed associated with GM-1, cyproheptadine, and clonidine are low compared to those seen with locomotor training. There was also Level 1 evidence that 4-aminopyridine and L-dopa were no better than placebo in helping to improve gait. Two Level 5 studies showed that baclofen had little to no effect on improving walking in persons with incomplete SCI. There is limited evidence that pharmacological agents tested so far would facilitate the recovery of walking after SCI. More studies are needed to better understand the effects of drugs combined with gait training on walking outcomes in people with SCI.","cyproheptadine"

A motorized treadmill was used and harness support provided when necessary. A repeated single-subject design was employed for the twelve subjects. The greatest effects were found in more severely disabled subjects. Cyproheptadine was associated with greatly reduced need for assistance, increases in maximum treadmill speed (MTS) and reduced clonus. Clonidine was associated with increases in MTS and a generally more upright posture. Baclofen was associated with minor changes in walking. In many cases of drug effects, MTS increases and other changes were retained following washout of drugs. The significance and implications of the drug effects and the retention of effects during washout periods are discussed.

The EMG activity of the lower limb muscles, initially characterized by tonic discharge and abnormal timing, became more phasic with less clonus following medication, which was related to a change in the kinematic pattern. Further kinematic and functional improvement were gained by training. Previously wheelchair-bound, both patients became functionally ambulatory overground with the aid of Canadian crutches.

Here we examine how over time motoneurons compensate for lost 5-HT to regain excitability. We find that, months after a spinal transection in rats, changes in post-transcriptional editing of 5-HT2C receptor mRNA lead to increased expression of 5-HT2C receptor isoforms that are spontaneously active (constitutively active) without 5-HT. Such constitutive receptor activity restores large persistent calcium currents in motoneurons in the absence of 5-HT. We show that this helps motoneurons recover their ability to produce sustained muscle contractions and ultimately enables recovery of motor functions such as locomotion. However, without regulation from the brain, these sustained contractions can also cause debilitating muscle spasms. Accordingly, blocking constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors with SB206553 or cyproheptadine, in both rats and humans, largely eliminates these calcium currents and muscle spasms, providing a new rationale for antispastic drug therapy.","cyproheptadine"

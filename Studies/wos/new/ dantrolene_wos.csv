Sixty Wistar rats were divided into groups MSCs, MSCs + DAN, DAN, trauma and placebo (TP) and no trauma and placebo (STP). Laminectomy was performed at T12 level in all animals, followed by a weight-drop model of SCI, except for the STP group. An hour later, the MSCs + DAN and DAN groups received 10mg/kg of DAN. After seven days, the MSCs and MSCs + DAN groups received 1x10(6) cells intravenously. Behavioral tests were performed to assess functional recovery for 28 days. Traumatized animals showed paraplegia. There was a significant improvement in groups MSCs, DAN and MSCs + DAN compared to TP (p<0.05). It was concluded that DAN and MSCs for the treatment of SCI in rats have neuroprotection effect and promote functional neurological improvement.","dantrolene"

A 52-year-old man treated with oral dantrolene for spasticity after spinal cord injury was scheduled to undergo irrigation and drainage of a thigh abscess under general anesthesia. He had taken 50 mg oral dantrolene per day for 3 years. Under standard neuromuscular monitoring, anesthesia was performed with propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of ED95 (0.3 mg/kg) of rocuronium could not depress T1 up to 95%. An additional dose of rocuronium depressed T1 completely and decreased the train-of-four (TOF) count to zero. There was no apparent prolongation of the neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium. The TOF ratio was recovered to more than 0.9 within 40 minutes after the last dose of rocuronium. A small dose of oral dantrolene does not prolong the duration of action and recovery of rocuronium.","dantrolene"

A 60-year-old patient in the rehabilitation phase following cervical spine injury presented with generalised weakness and deteriorating respiratory function, requiring intensive care admission, tracheal intubation and ventilation. He had bilateral basal lung collapse and a raised diaphragm and was on high-dose oral dantrolene. The cessation of dantrolene resulted in a dramatic recovery of respiratory function within two days. High-dose oral dantrolene can cause severe respiratory insufficiency and may present difficulties in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries.","dantrolene"

Riluzole and dantrolene have been shown to provide neuroprotection by reducing neuronal apoptosis after brain and spinal cord injury (SCI) in several animal models of neurologic disorders. As these drugs protect the injured spinal cord through different mechanisms, we investigated the cumulative effects of riluzole and dantrolene.","dantrolene"

Dantrolene has been shown to be neuroprotective by reducing neuronal apoptosis after SCI. Furthermore, in addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, it appears to have a beneficial action on voiding, once this drug acts on the external urethral sphincter relaxation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dantrolene on urinary bladder injury that follows experimental SCI. Forty-six male Wistar rats were laminectomized at T13, and a compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. After euthanasia, the urinary bladder was removed for gross and histological evaluation. Traumatized animals showed urinary retention with severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Injured animals treated with dantrolene had less bladder hemorrhage and inflammatory infiltrate than those treated with placebo (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that dantrolene may protect against urinary bladder lesions that follow SCI. Treating spinal cord-injured patients with this agent may be a promising additional therapeutic strategy to alleviate the accompanying inflammatory process. The results of the current study show that dantrolene has protective effects on spinal cord contusion-induced urinary bladder injury. The impaired integrity of bladder morphology was ameliorated by dantrolene treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.","dantrolene"

We used 25 rats (Rattus norvegicus) that were divided into five groups. The negative control group (NC) consisted of animals without spinal cord trauma. In the groups with spinal cord trauma, the positive control group (PC) was given no treatment, the MS group was treated with methylprednisolone, the MS/DS group was treated with methylprednisolone and dantrolene, and the DS group was treated with dantrolene alone. The animals' motor function was evaluated daily, as measured with the open field test. Eight days after surgery, the animals were euthanized for spinal cord collection. Descriptive morphological evaluation, anti-NeuN immunohistochemistry, TUNEL, and anti-Bax immunofluorescence were performed. There was no significant difference between the PC, MS, MS/DS and DS groups with respect to BBB scores, neuronal and glial staining, or Bax expression (P < 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that methylprednisolone sodium succinate, dantrolene sodium, or the combination of these drugs did not reduce neuronal and glial loss, intrinsic pathway apoptosis, or promote functional recovery.","dantrolene"

Twenty-four New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups: Sham (no drug or operation, n = 8), Control (SCI + 1 mL saline intraperitoneally (i.p.), n = 8), and DNT (SCI + 10 mg/kg dantrolene in 1 mL, i.p., n = 8). Laminectomy was performed at T10 and balloon catheter was applied extradurally. Four and 24 h after surgery, rabbits were evaluated according to the Tarlov scoring system. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid and tissue sample from spinal cord were taken for measurements of antioxidant status or detection of apoptosis. After 4 h SCI, all animals in control or DNT-treated groups became paraparesic. Significant improvement was observed in DNT-treated group, 24 h after SCI, with respect to control. Traumatic SCI led to an increase in the lipid peroxidation and a decrease in enzymic or non-enzymic endogenous antioxidative defense systems, and increase in apoptotic cell numbers. DNT treatment prevented lipid peroxidation and augmented endogenous enzymic or non-enzymic antioxidative defense systems. Again, DNT treatment significantly decreased the apoptotic cell number induced by SCI. In conclusion, experimental results observed in this study suggest that treatment with dantrolene possess potential benefits for traumatic SCI.","dantrolene"

We examined the effects of traumatic compressive injury on (Ca2+)(i) dynamics in spinal cord white matter. We conducted electrophysiological studies with ryanodine and inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) receptor agonists and antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury (SCI). A 25-30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber (37degreesC) and injured with a modified clip (2-g closing force) for 15 sec. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential (CAP) with glass microelectrodes. The CAP decreased to 55.2 +/- 6.8% of control (p < 0.05) after spinal cord injury (SCI). Chelation of Ca-i(2+) with BAPTA-AM (a high-affinity calcium chelator) promoted significantly greater recovery of CAP amplitude (83.2 +/- 4.2% of control; p < 0.05) after injury. Infusion of caffeine (1 and 10 mM) exacerbated CAP amplitude decline (45.1 +/- 5.9% of control; p < 0.05; 44.6 +/- 3.1% of control; p < 0.05) postinjury. Blockade of Ca-i(2+) release through ryanodine-sensitive receptors (RyRs) with dantrolene (10 muM) and ryanodine (50 muM), conferred significant (p < 0.05) improvement in CAP amplitude after injury. On the other hand, blockade of Ca-i(2+) with inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate receptor (IP(3)Rs) blocker 2APB (10 muM) also conferred significant improvement i in CAP amplitude after injury (82.9 +/- 7.9%; p < 0.05). In conclusion, the injurious effects of Ca-i(2+) in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) white matter injury appear to be mediated both by RyRs and through IP3Rs calcium-induced calcium release receptors (CICRs).","dantrolene"

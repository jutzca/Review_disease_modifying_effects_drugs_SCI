Electroneurography was performed 1, 2, and 4 weeks later, and nerve regeneration was evaluated by electron and light microscopy and Western blotting in week 4. Results Regarding the comparison between preoperative values and week 4, the latency difference in group 1 (1.25 milliseconds) was significantly higher than those of groups 2 to 4 (0.56, 0.34, and 0.10 milliseconds, respectively;P= .001). The latency increment in groups 2 and 3 was higher than that of group 4 (P= .002 andP= .046) in week 4, whereas groups 2 and 3 did not differ significantly (P= .291). Amplitude difference was not statistically significant from week 4 among all groups (allP >.05). The number of myelinated axons was significantly higher in all treatment groups than in the control group (P= .001). Axon number and intensity were significantly higher in group 4 as compared with groups 2 and 3 (P= .009,P= .005). Conclusion After primary neurorrhaphy, dexamethasone and bumetanide alone promoted nerve recovery based on electrophysiologic and histologic measures.

To date, the underlying pathophysiology of such a finding remains unclear and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is considered as the potential etiology in the literature. However, no experimental research has been reported to prove this hypothesis. The present study investigated whether IRI occurs following decompression surgery using an experimental rat model of chronic compressive spinal cord injury (SCI). A chronic spinal cord compression model was developed with various sizes of polymer sheets (mild and severe compression) that were microsurgically implanted underneath the T8-9 laminae, and occurrence of IRI in the spinal cord following decompression was determined by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. In the mild compression groups, after decompression SOD activities significantly increased along with a reduction in MDA content compared with the non-decompression group (P<0.05), which exhibited diminishment of lipid peroxidation and relief of the secondary injury. These findings indicated that decompression is effective to improve neurological recovery and may deliver improved outcomes for chronic mild compression of the spinal cord. However, in severe compression groups, after decompression, SOD activities markedly reduced further along with a significant increase in MDA content compared with non-decompression group (P<0.05). The results indicated that lipid peroxidation increased immediately after decompression surgery which resulted from reperfusion of the spinal cord. These findings demonstrated IRI may occur as a result of chronic severe compression of the spinal cord. In clinical practice, sudden cord expansion and reperfusion may have lead to disruption in the blood spinal cord barrier, and triggered a cascade of IRI resulting in postoperative neurologic deterioration. Recognition of this neurological deterioration following removal for intraspinal meningiomas may improve preoperative patient counseling and merits further study for determination of the precise pathophysiology.","dexamethasone"

The administration of steroids has several side-effects that jeopardize their use and therefore safer chemical neuro-entities are required. Natural compounds such as curcumin (anti-oxidant) and quercetin (anti-inflammatory) have been investigated as alternative neuroactive, but are not as potent as the steroids. Hence, they are required in very high doses which may lead to significant toxicity causing an increase in cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, active iron chelation, inhibiting the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. A reduction in the dose of these neuroactives is possible with the administration of a 'chemically-variant' permutation with additive or synergistic therapeutic benefits. Therefore, we hypothesize that curcumin and quercetin, both natural polyphenolic flavonoids, can ""additively and synergistically"" improve the physiological outcome after traumatic SCI when used in combination and termed 'Cur(Que)min' - thereby decreasing the dose levels and hence reducing the inherent high dose-cytotoxicity of the individual neuroactives. This hypothesis provides the first-account of a curcumin-quercetin combination for SCI intervention theorizing the possible biomolecular-mechanism that may provide the scientific community with a novel neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic treatment option for SCI.

Patients often present with a history of progressive pain, paralysis, sensory loss, progressive spinal deformity, and loss of sphincter control. It is an emergency that requires rapid decision making on the part of several specialists, given the risk of permanent spinal cord injury or death. The goals of treatment in spinal metastases are pain control and improvement of neurological function in order to achieve better quality of life (QoL). The standard of care in most cases is rapid initiation of corticosteroids in combination with either surgical decompression in case of an operable candidate, followed by radiation therapy (RT) or RT alone. Surgery is associated with improved outcomes, but is not appropriate for many patients presenting with advanced symptoms of MSCC, such as paralysis, or those with a poor performance status, or cachexic state, as well as altered mental conditions, comorbidities, surgical risks, and limited life expectancy. On the other hand, aggressive surgical treatment and post-operative RT is advocated for those with more favorable prognosis, or who are expected to have higher neurological recovery potential. Many candidates may require for combined anterior and posterior approaches to effectively deal with the compressive pathology and stabilize the spine. Most patients are presently treated by primary RT, given with the aim of improving function and symptom management. However, there is still debate regarding the most appropriate RT schedule. Rehabilitation can serve to relieve symptoms, QoL, enhance functional independence, and prevent further complications. Ambulatory status has been found to be an important prognostic factor for patients with MSCC.","dexamethasone"

Recently, it has been reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in the inflammatory reaction. The present study investigates if anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody can facilitate functional recovery in the olfactory system following injury. Rat anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR16-1) was intraperitoneally injected to severe olfactory nerve injury model mice immediately after the nerve transection (NTx). Histological assessment of recovery within the olfactory bulb was made at 5-70 days. X-gal staining labeled the degenerating and regenerating olfactory nerve fibers and immunohistochemical staining detected the presence of reactive astrocytes and macrophages/microglia. MR16-1-injected animals showed significantly smaller areas of injury-associated tissue, fewer astrocytes and macrophages/microglia, and an increase in regenerating nerve fibers. Olfactory function assessments using both an olfactory avoidance behavioral test and evoked potential testing showed improved functional recovery in MR16-1-injected mice. These findings suggest that blockade of IL-6R could provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction following head injuries.

Characterized disruption of axons and irreversible loss of neurons in SCI, and further damage in spinal cord tissue caused by following secondary injuries, such as the formation of glial scar and inflammation, makes it even harder to recover for affected patients. Tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA), which possesses the capability of promoting neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in vitro, might alleviate the injuries, and facilitate the neural tissue regeneration in experimental animal models of SCI. Here, we developed a concomitant treatment of tFNA and neural stem cells (NSCs) for the synergistic therapy in treating the injury of the spinal cord. We first observed that tFNA could promote cell proliferation of NSCs then verified that the concomitant treatment of tFNA and NSCs showed the neuroprotective actions by increasing the survival of transplanted NSCs. Furthermore, the recovery of motor function and the tissue regeneration in the lesion site of the spinal cord achieved the best performance in the SCI rats treated with the combination of tFNA and NSCs than others, and the formation of glial scar was the least. Our findings provide novel evidence of a promising strategy for synergistic treatment of SCI in the future.","dexamethasone"

In this study, we established an in-vitro model of spinal cord injury to study the effects of dexamethasone on mechanical injury, autophagy, and apoptosis in spinal cord neurons. The results showed that dexamethasone inhibited the level of autophagy in the injured nerve cells in a dose-dependent manner. High doses of dexamethasone protected the damaged spinal cord neurons by inhibiting apoptosis, but a protective effect from low hormone concentrations was not obvious.

Melatonin is an indolamine that is primarily secreted by the pineal gland and known to be regulated by photoperiodicity. However, it is also a versatile hormone with antioxidative, antiapoptotic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we review the neuroprotective properties of melatonin and the potential mechanisms by which it might be beneficial in the treatment of SCI.

Previously, we showed that dexamethasone, an immunosuppressive corticosteroid, attenuated early expression of three molecules associated with microglia/macrophages activation following TBI in rats. Here, the effects of dexamethasone on the early expression of RhoA have been investigated in brains of TBI rats by immunohistochemistry. In brains of rats treated with TBI alone, significant RhoA(+) cell accumulation was observed at 18 h post-injury and continuously increased during our observed time period. The accumulated RhoA(+) cells were distributed to the areas of pannecrosis and selective neuronal loss. Most accumulated RhoA(+) cells were identified as active microglia/macrophages by double-labelling. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally injected on day 0 and 2 immediately following brain injury. Numbers of RhoA(+) cells were significantly reduced on day 1 and 2 following administration of dexamethasone but returned to vehicle control level on day 4. However, dexamethasone treatment did not change the proportion of RhoA(+) cells.

Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg was administered as a positive control. Locomotor function was evaluated using the BBB score system. H&E staining and Nissl staining were performed to observe the histological changes in the spinal cord. The levels of MDA and GSH and the activity of SOD were assessed to reflect the oxidative stress state. The production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1 was assessed using ELISA kits to examine the inflammatory responses in the spinal cord. TUNEL staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and MAPK proteins. The results demonstrated that GS Rd 25 and 50 mg/kg significantly improved the locomotor function of rats after SCI, reduced tissue injury and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord. Mechanically, GS Rd decreased MDA level, increased GSH level and SOD activity, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented cell apoptosis. The effects were equivalent to those of dexamethasone. In addition, GS Rd effectively inhibited the activation of MAPK signalling pathway induced by SCI, which might be involved in the protective effects of GS Rd against SCI. In conclusion, GS Rd attenuates SCI-induced secondary injury through reversing the redox-state imbalance, inhibiting the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the spinal cord tissue.","dexamethasone"

The number of NADPH-d positive neurons or Fos immunoreactive nuclei was studied by computer-assisted image analysis in superficial dorsal horn (Laminae I-III) and central canal area (Lamina X) below the lesion. While constitutive Fos immunoreactive nuclei were sparse in controls, SO increased Fos expression at 2 and 4 h after injury. DEX treatment significantly enhanced the number of Fos positive nuclei in Laminae I-III by 4 It after transection, although the response was not maintained by intensive steroid treatment when tested at 48 li after SCI. NADPH-d positive neurons in Laminae I-III increased at 2 and 4 h after SO while a delayed increased was found in central canal area (Lamina X). DEX treatment decreased NADPH-d positive neurons to sham-operated levels at all time points examined. Thus, while GC stimulation of Fos suggests activation of neurons involved in sympathetic outflow and/or pain, down-regulation of NADPH-d indicates attenuation of nociceptive outflow, considering the role of enzyme-derived nitric oxide in pain-related mechanisms.

For the first time, similar methodology also has been applied to study the effects of hypothermia. Canine spinal cords were injured at T13 by use of an epidural balloon and then were treated with local hypothermia or intramuscular dexamethasone or both. Motor recovery was assessed using a modified Tarlov scale. At either 6 days or 7 weeks, spinal cords T8 through L4 were removed and divided into 10 ordered blocks, which were analyzed for wet and dry weight, potassium concentration, and sodium concentration. Correlations between clinical motor and chemical results were evaluated. The conclusions drawn are as follows: 1) The canine severe rapid compressive injury model, unlike the previously published less severe feline impact injury model, is not associated with widespread early loss of spinal cord tissue potassium content (dry weight). 2) The dog compressive model, unlike the cat impact model, does not provide evidence that one fundamental mechanism of the confirmed beneficial action of steroids entails enhanced early preservation of tissue potassium content. 3) At 6 days, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and increase in sodium concentration, representing edema, occurred at and adjacent to the direct compression site in all lesioned dog groups except those treated with dexamethasone, demonstrating an antiedema effect of dexamethasone that was nullified by concurrent local hypothermia. 4) This antiedema effect of dexamethasone was associated with superior early motor improvement but did not lead to superior long-term function, in comparison with hypothermia. 5) At 7 weeks, decrease in the percentage of dry weight and potassium concentration, and increase in sodium concentration, all restricted to the directly compressed segment, signify necrosis. 6) This new chemical index of necrosis was highly correlated with clinical motor performance.","dexamethasone"

SCI induces the expression of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), that in the absence of the high affinity component, TrkA, can promote cell death by apoptosis. We therefore hypothesized that a reduction of p75NTR expression in SCI may increase tissue sparing and therefore improve recovery of function. As a tool to test our hypothesis we used the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) to down-regulate p75NTR expression. A standardized thoracic spinal cord contusion injury was produced in female rats. Laminectomized and SCI rats received various doses of DEX immediately after injury and the treatment was continued daily for 7 days. DEX, given at high doses (20 mg/kg, s.c.) but not at low doses (1 or 8 mg/kg) prevented the increase in p75NTR mRNA and protein in SCI rats, without affecting the expression of TrkA. High doses of DEX also reduced cellular apoptosis both in white and gray matters. This effect correlated with the ability of DEX to accelerate behavioral recovery of function measured by a combined behavioral score. These data suggest that reduction of p75NTR in SCI may be a therapeutic strategy to limit cell and tissue damage and therefore to improve recovery of function in SCT patients.

These events apparently include the activation of immune-derived cells and their products, as treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, limits the damage and thus improves recovery. On the other hand, immune-derived substances, such as cytokines, are thought to play an important role in post-traumatic axonal regeneration. Thus, the need to reduce inflammation to limit the spread of damage appears to be in conflict with the need to permit inflammation to promote regeneration. Comprehension and resolution of this apparent conflict may lead to the development of treatment protocols aimed at rescuing axons spared by the initial injury, without hampering the potential regeneration of directly and indirectly injured axons. In this study, carried out on rats with crushed optic nerves, daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone commencing prior to the injury significantly attenuated the injury-induced decrease in electrophysiological activity and reduced the area of tissue damage. On the other hand, dexamethasone treatment reduced the permissiveness of the injured nerves to neural adhesion and regrowth in vitro. This latter phenomenon was also observed in injured peripheral nerves. Results are discussed with respect to the possible establishment of an appropriate protocol for corticosteroid treatment of nerve injuries aimed at promoting neuronal rescue without compromising neuronal regeneration.","dexamethasone"

It is still under debate whether activated microglia promote neuronal survival, or whether they exacerbate the original extent of neuronal damage. Protagonists of the view that microglial cells cause secondary damage have proposed that inhibition of microglial activation by immunosuppression is beneficial after acute CNS damage. It is the aim of this review to analyse the effects of immunosuppressants on isolated microglial cells and neurons, and to scrutinize the effects of immunosuppression in different in vivo models of acute CNS trauma or ischemia. It is found that the immunosuppressants cytosine-arabinoside, different steroids, cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, and minocycline all have direct inhibitory effects on microglial cells. These effects are mainly exerted by inhibiting microglial proliferation or microglial secretion of neurotoxic substances such as proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. Furthermore, immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia results in improved structure preservation and, mostly, in enhanced function. However, all investigated immunosuppressants also have direct effects on neurons, and some immunosuppressants affect other glial cells such as astrocytes. In summary, it is safe to conclude that immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia is neuroprotective. Furthermore, circumferential evidence indicates that microglial activation after traumatic or ischemic CNS damage is not beneficial to adjacent neurons in the immediate aftermath of such acute lesions. Further experiments with more specific agents or genetic approaches that specifically inhibit microglial cells are needed in order to fully answer the question of whether microglial activation is ""good or bad"".

Here, we investigated whether TLRs are involved in regulating the immune response, Wallerian degeneration (WD), and nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve lesion. Early expression of interleukin-1 beta and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was compromised in the sciatic nerve distal stump of mice deficient in TLR signaling. In addition, significantly fewer macrophages were recruited and/or activated in the sciatic nerve distal stump of TLR2-, TLR4-, and MyD88-deficient mice compared with wild-type littermates, whereas WD, axonal regeneration, and recovery of locomotor function were impaired. In contrast, animals that received a single microinjection of TLR2 and TLR4 ligands at the site of sciatic nerve lesion had faster clearance of the degenerating myelin and recovered earlier than saline-injected control rats. Finally, rats that had altered innate immune response through dexamethasone treatment exhibited three times more myelin debris in their sciatic nerve distal stump and a significant delay in recovery of locomotor function. Our results provide strong evidence that TLR signaling plays a critical role in orchestrating the innate immune response leading to efficient and rapid clearance of inhibitory myelin debris and nerve regeneration.","dexamethasone"

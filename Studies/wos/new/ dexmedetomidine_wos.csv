The disruption of blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is a major step in the secondary injury of SCI. Until recently there are no restorative therapies for traumatic SCI. BSCB is considered to be a therapeutic target for SCI, however few biomaterials have been developed to restore the disrupted BSCB in SCI. In this study, an AST-PCL membrane was fabricated with a steady release of Astragoloside IV (AST) and its effects on BSCB repair as well as the functional recovery of SCI were evaluated. Firstly, this study demonstrated that AST-PCL (polycaprolactone) degradation media protects endothelial cells from apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and decreasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, it also attenuates the stress fiber formation in vitro. Secondly, the rat model of traumatic SCI showed that AST-PCL treatment inhibits the disruption of BSCB permeability, as detected by MRI, Evan's Blue extravasation and water content. Thirdly, this study found that AST-PCL up-regulates the level of tight junction proteins including Occludin, Claudin-5 and ZO-1. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that AST-PCL treatment down-regulates Matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion and diminishes neutrophil infiltration. Finally, this study found that AST-PCL treatment could significantly inhibit apoptosis, decrease tissue damage and improve functional recovery in SCI rats. Taken together, this study shows that AST-PCL might be an efficient biomaterial for BSCB repair and a potential drug therapy for SCI.","dexmedetomidine"

Neuroinflammation at the lesion site contributes to secondary tissue injury and permanent locomotor dysfunction. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in both preclinical and clinical trials. We investigated the effect of DEX on the microglial response, and histological and neurological outcomes in a rat model of cervical spinal cord injury.","dexmedetomidine"

The rats (n = 40) were equally divided into four groups: G1, G2, G3, and G4. Rats in the Cl group underwent a laminectomy only. For the rats in the G2, G3, and G4 groups, spinal cord injury was induced by placing an aneurysm clip extradurally for 60 Sat T10. The rats in G2 did not receive any post-injury treatment. Immediately after trauma was induced, rats in G3 were given methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) and in G4, dexmedetomidine (10 mu g/kg), both intraperitoneally. The rats were sacrificed under anesthesia 24 hours later and 1.5 cm lengths of injured spinal cord were obtained. Malonyldialdehyde values were significantly increased in G2 compared to G1, G3 and G4 (p < 0.05). The neuronal cell count in G1 was significantly higher than in G2 and G3 (p = 0.0001; p = 0.007). G4 had higher cell counts compared to G2 and G3 (p = 0.0001; p = 0.05). These findings indicated that dexmedetomidine might have neuroprotective effects in spinal cord injury. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-two New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups: sham (no drug or operation, n = 6), Control [SCI + single dose of 1 mL saline intraperitoneally (i.p), after trauma; n = 8] and DEX (SCI + 1 mu g/kg dexmedetomidine in 1 mL, i.p, after trauma, n = 8). Laminectomy was performed at T10 and balloon angioplasty catheter was applied extradurally. Four and 24 h after surgery, rabbits were evaluated by an independent observer according to the Tarlov scoring system. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tissue samples from spinal cord were taken for biochemical and histopathological evaluations. After 4 h of SCI, all animals in control or DEX treated groups became paraparesic. On the other hand, 24 h after SCI, partial improvements were observed in both control and DEX treated groups. Traumatic SCI leads to increase in the lipid peroxidation and decreases enzymatic or nonenzymatic endogenous antioxidative defense systems. Again, SCI leads to apoptosis in spinal cord. DEX treatment slightly prevented lipid peroxidation and augmented endogenous antioxidative defense systems in CSF or spinal cord tissue, but failed to prevent apoptosis or neurodeficit after traumatic SCI. Therefore, it could be suggested that treatment with dexmedetomidine does not produce beneficial results in SCI.","dexmedetomidine"

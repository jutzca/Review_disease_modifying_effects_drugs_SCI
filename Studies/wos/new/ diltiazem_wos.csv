To identify pharmacological enhancers of axon regeneration, 960 compounds were screened for cortical neuron axonal regrowth using an in vitro cortical scrape assay. Diltiazem, verapamil, and bromopride were discovered to facilitate axon regeneration in rat cortical cultures, in the presence of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Diltiazem, an L-type calcium channel blocker (L-CCB), also promotes axon outgrowth in adult primary mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and induced human sensory (iSensory) neurons.","diltiazem"

Over recent years, it has emerged that extracellular adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP) regulates the function of photoreceptors in rodents and primates. Moreover, when the retina is exposed to high levels of ATP, rapid death of photoreceptors occurs, which can be blocked by pretreatment with antagonists to P2X receptors. Compounds that inhibit the action of extracellular ATP slow photoreceptor loss in an animal model of inherited retinal degeneration. In this article, I provide an overview of our work in relation to other research in this area and suggest a model by which ATP contributes to photoreceptor death in inherited retinal degenerations.

To examine the relevance of these findings to neurotrauma, we conducted electrophysiological studies with inorganic Ca2+ channels blockers and L- and N-subtype-specific calcium channel antagonists in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury. Confocal immunohistochemistry was used to examine for localization of L- and N-type calcium channels in spinal cord white matter tracts. A 30-mm length of dorsal column was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, pinned in an in vitro recording chamber and injured with a modified clip (2 g closing force) for 15 s. The functional integrity of the dorsal column was monitored electrophysiologically by quantitatively measuring the compound action potential at two points with glass microelectrodes. The compound action potential decreased to 71.4 +/- 2.0% of control (P < 0.05) after spinal cord injury. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ promoted significantly greater recovery of compound action potential amplitude (86.3 +/- 7.6% of control; P < 0.05) after injury. Partial blockade of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with cobalt (20 mu M) or cadmium (200 mu M) conferred improvement in compound action potential amplitude. Application of the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers diltiazem (50 mu M) or verapamil (90 mu M), and the N-type antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 mu M), significantly enhanced the recovery of compound action potential amplitude postinjury. Go-application of the L-type antagonist diltiazem with the N-type blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA showed significantly greater (P < 0.05) improvement in compound action potential amplitude than application of either drug alone. Confocal immunohistochemistry with double labelling for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GalC and NF200 demonstrated L- and N-type Ca2+ channels on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not axons, in spinal cord white matter.","diltiazem"

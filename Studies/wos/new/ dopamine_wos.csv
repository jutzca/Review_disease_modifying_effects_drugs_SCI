In this study, an injectable silk fibroin/polydopamine (SF/PDA) composite hydrogel was fabricated via first Schiff base reaction between the amino groups of silk fibroin and the quinone structure of oxidized dopamine (DA), and then self-polymerization of free DA with SF-conjugated DA. The physicochemical properties of the hydrogel were characterized. The cytotoxicity and biocompatibility were evaluated using L929 fibroblasts and hippocampal neurons, respectively, and the expression levels of neuritesrelated proteins were analyzed by western blot. Finally, the effect of hydrogel on SCI repair was initially evaluated by in vivo animal experiment. With the increase of DA concentration, the hydrogels color became darker, the swelling rate, water uptake and the porosity decreased. Meanwhile, the Young's modulus continued to decrease when the DA concentration was increased from 0.5 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL, whereas rheological test showed the good injectability of the prepared hydrogels. NMR, FTIR and XPS confirmed that dopamine could combine with silk fibroin via Schiff base reaction and then polymerize to form the SF/PDA composite hydrogel. The hydrogels showed no cytotoxicity and the hippocampal neurons on hydrogel with 2 mg/mL DA displayed the largest axon length, the highest cell density and expression level of neuritis-related proteins. Further on, immunohistochemical staining showed initially that the prepared hydrogel possessed the capability of promoting SCI repair. In summary, the developed injectable SF/PDA hydrogel here may contribute to the potential application for promoting functional recovery of SCI, and provide important experimental and theoretical basis for developing SCI implants.","dopamine"

We have recently reported that the locomotor CPG in neonatal mice rapidly recovers the ability to produce neurochemically induced fictive locomotion following an upper lumbar spinal cord compression injury. Here we address the question of recovery of multi-rhythmic activity and the serotonin-sensitivity of the CPG. In isolated spinal cords from control and 3 days post-injury mice, application of dopamine and NMDA elicited multi-rhythmic activity with slow and fast components. The slow component comprised 10-20 s episodes of activity that were synchronous in ipsilateral or all lumbar ventral roots, and the fast components involved bursts within these episodes that displayed coordinated patterns of alternation between ipsilateral roots. Rhythm strength was the same in control and injured spinal cords. However, power spectral analysis of signal within episodes showed a reduced peak frequency after recovery. In control spinal cords, serotonin triggered fictive locomotion only when applied at high concentration (30 M, constant NMDA). By contrast, in about 50% of injured preparations fictive locomotion was evoked by 2-3 times lower serotonin concentrations (10-15 mu M). This increased serotonin sensitivity was correlated with post-injury changes in the expression of specific serotonin receptor transcripts, but not of dopamine receptor transcripts.","dopamine"

We recently found that a crushed spinal cord lesion can minimize fibrotic scarring and grafted cell death compared with open-dura injuries. To determine if this SCI model is applicable for studying cardiovascular recovery, we examined hemodynamic consequences following crushed SCI and tested cardiovascular responses to serotonin (5-HT) or dopamine (DA) receptor agonists. Using a radio-telemetric system, multiple cardiovascular parameters were recorded prior to, 2, and 4 weeks after SCI, including resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), as well as spontaneous or colorectal distension (CRD)-induced autonomic dysreflexia (AD). The results showed that this injury caused tachycardia at rest as well as the occurrence of spontaneous or artificially induced dysreflexic events. Four weeks post-injury, specific activation of 5-HT2A receptors by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intrathecal (i.t.) delivery of Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) remarkably increased resting MAP levels in a dose-dependent fashion. During CRD-induced autonomic dysreflexia, systemic administration of DOI alleviated the severity of bradycardia responsive to episodic hypertension. In contrast, selective stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors with 8-OH-DPAT or non-selective activation of DA receptors with apomorphine did not affect cardiovascular performance. Thus, crush injuries induce cardiovascular abnormalities in rats that are sensitive to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation, indicating a reliable SCI model to study how cell-based approaches impact the severity of autonomic dysreflexia and identify a possible target for pharmacological interventions.","dopamine"

With the development of robust methods to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to specific neural subtypes, cell replacement therapy holds renewed promise to treat a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and injuries at scale. As these cell sources are evaluated in preclinical models, new transsynaptic tracing methods are making it possible to study the connectivity between host and graft neurons with greater speed and detail than was previously possible. To date, these studies have revealed that widespread, long-lasting, and anatomically appropriate synaptic contacts are established between host and graft neurons, as well as new aspects of host-graft connectivity which may be relevant to clinical cell replacement therapy. It is not yet clear, however, whether the synaptic connectivity between graft and host neurons is as cell-type specific as it is in the endogenous nervous system, or whether that connectivity is responsible for the functional efficacy of cell replacement therapy. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the new contacts established between host and graft neurons may indeed be cell-type specific, and how transsynaptic tracing can be used in the future to further elucidate the mechanisms of graft-mediated functional recovery in spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease.","dopamine"

We aimed to determine the effects of optimizing spinal cord perfusion on neurological recovery and risks for adverse events. We searched multiple databases for published and unpublished reports. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. We synthesized data and evaluated confidence in anticipated treatment effects according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We identified 20 eligible observational studies and 1 eligible randomized controlled trial. According to low or very low quality evidence, the effect of MAP support on neurological recovery after acute traumatic spinal cord injury is uncertain, and the use of vasopressors to support MAP may be associated with increased rates of predominantly cardiac adverse events. Increased SCPP appears likely to be associated with improved neurological recovery, but SCPP monitoring via intradural catheters at the anatomical site of injury may involve increased risks of cerebrospinal fluid leakage requiring revision surgery or pseudomeningocele. No study directly compared the effects of specific MAP goal ranges, SCPP ranges, SCPP monitoring techniques, or durations of treatment. Very low quality evidence suggests that norepinephrine may have less risk of adverse events than dopamine. The current literature is insufficient to make strong recommendations about interventions to support spinal cord perfusion via MAP or SCPP goals in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries. Data are compatible with a variety of treatment decisions, and individualized approaches may be optimal. Further investigation to clarify the risks, benefits, and alternatives to MAP or SCPP support in this population is warranted.","dopamine"

PDA composition could maintain the higher conduction and elastic modulus of this film after the immersion of 3 w, due to the stronger force between PDA molecule and CGO sheets or PPy particles. The results of cell experiments indicated the better adhesion and higher expression of neural proteins in rat Schwann cells (RSCs) on PDA/CGO/PPy-PLLA films, because the composition of PDA provided more absorption and immobilization site for proteins and the regular coating of PDA particles on the CGO sheets reduced the potential damage of Graphene derivatives on the cell membrane integrity. Electrical stimulation (ES) could facilitate similar to 31 % of RSCs to align along the current direction on PDA/CGO/PPy-PLLA films, significantly higher than those on PPy-PLLA and CGO/PPy-PLLA films.

The strong link between dopamine and motor learning has been well-established in the animal literature with similar findings reported in healthy adults and the elderly. Objective. We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. Methods. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. Results. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. Conclusions. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.","dopamine"

Technologies collectively called ""-omics"" enable simultaneous measurement of an enormous number of biomolecules that can capture many potential biological contributors to heterogeneity of injury/disease course and outcome. Due to the nature of injury and complex disease, and its associations with impairment, disability, and recovery, rehabilitation does not lend itself to a singular ""protocolized"" plan of therapy. Yet, by nature and by necessity, rehabilitation medicine operates as a functional model of ""Personalized Care"". Thus, the challenge for successful programs of translational rehabilitation care and research is to identify viable approaches to examine broad populations, with varied impairments and functional limitations, and to identify effective treatment responses that incorporate personalized protocols to optimize functional recovery. The Rehabilomics framework is a translational model that provides an ""-omics"" overlay to the scientific study of rehabilitation processes and multidimensional outcomes.

Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.","dopamine"

Here we studied the recovery of crawling in the leech Hirudo verbana after descending cephalic fibers were surgically separated from crawl central pattern generators shown previously to be regulated by dopamine. We observed that immediately after nerve cord transection leeches were unable to crawl, but remarkably, after a day to weeks, animals began to show elements of crawling and intersegmental coordination. Over a similar time course, excessive swimming due to the loss of descending inhibition returned to control levels. Additionally, removal of the brain did not prevent crawl recovery, indicating that connectivity of severed descending neurons was not essential. After crawl recovery, a subset of animals received a second transection immediately below the anterior-most ganglion remaining. Similar to their initial transection, a loss of crawling with subsequent recovery was observed. These data, in recovered individuals, support the idea that compensatory plasticity directly below the site of injury is essential for the initiation and coordination of crawling.

Here, we asked whether similar recovery occurs following lumbar injury that impacts more directly on the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). As in thoracic injuries, lumbar injuries caused about 90% neuronal loss at the injury site and increased serotonergic innervation below the injury. Motor recovery was slower after lumbar than thoracic injury, but virtually normal function was attained by P25 in both cases. Locomotor CPG status was tested by eliciting fictive locomotion in isolated spinal cords using a widely used neurochemical cocktail (NMDA, dopamine, serotonin). No fictive locomotion could be elicited 1 day post-injury, but could within 3days post-injury as readily as in age-matched uninjured control spinal cords. Burst patterning and coordination were largely similar in injured and control spinal cords but there were differences. Notably, in both groups there were two main locomotor frequencies, but injured spinal cords exhibited a shift towards the higher frequency. Injury also altered the neurochemical dependence of locomotor CPG output, such that injured spinal cords, unlike control spinal cords, were incapable of generating low frequency rhythmic coordinated activity in the presence of NMDA and dopamine alone. Thus, the neonatal spinal cord also exhibits remarkable functional recovery after lumbar injuries, but the neurochemical sensitivity of locomotor circuitry is modified in the process.","dopamine"

Although traditionally it is believed that in mammalian spinal cord, monoamine neurotransmitters mainly originate from the brain, accumulating evidence indicates that especially when the spinal cord is injured, they can also be produced in the spinal cord. In this review, I will present evidence for a possible pathway for two-step synthesis of dopamine and serotonin in the spinal cord. Published data from different sources and unpublished data from my own ongoing projects indicate that monoenzymatic cells expressing aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) are present in the spinal cord and that these TH and THP cells often lie in close proximity to AADC cells. Prompted by the above evidence, I hypothesize that dopamine and serotonin could be synthesized sequentially in two monoenzymatic cells in the spinal cord via a TH-AADC and a TPH-AADC cascade respectively. The monoamines synthesized through this pathway may compensate for lost neurotransmitters following spinal cord injury and also may play specific roles in the recovery of sensory, motor and autonomic functions","dopamine"

Ejaculation is a reflex and the spinal generator for ejaculatory reflexes in the rat has been located in the lumbosacral spinal cord. The effects of SCI on the rat spinal ejaculation generator and ejaculatory reflexes remain understudied. The first goal of the current study was to establish the effects of chronic SCI on the function of the spinal ejaculation generator. Male rats received a contusion injury of the spinal cord at spinal level T6-T7. Ejaculatory reflexes elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsal penile nerve (DPN) were evaluated in injured and control rats at 4-6 weeks following SCI. SCI males demonstrated significant reductions in bursting of the bulbocavernosus muscle (BCM), an indicator for expulsion phase of ejaculation, and in seminal vesicle pressure (SVP) increases, an indicator for the emission phase of ejaculation, following DPN stimulation. Thus, contusion SCI resulted in long-term impairment of ejaculatory reflexes. The D3 agonist 7-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (7OHDPAT) facilitates ejaculation in spinal cord intact rats, thus the second goal of the current study was to test whether subcutaneous infusions of 7OHDPAT can facilitate ejaculatory reflexes in rats with chronic SCI. Male rats received a contusion injury at T6-T7 and effects of systemic administration of 7OHDPAT (1mg/kg) were tested 4-5 weeks following injury. Results showed that 7OHDPAT administration facilitated ejaculatory reflexes in SCI males with or without DPN stimulation, provided that supraspinal inputs to the lumbar cord were severed by transection just prior to evaluating the reflex. Thus, 7OHDPAT administration in SCI males was able to overcome the detrimental effects of SCI on ejaculatory reflexes.","dopamine"

Following transection of the spinal cord just caudal to the anus, the animals displayed higher tail beat frequencies and lower tail beat amplitudes than before surgery, owing to the loss of power in this region. Swimming performance then progressively recovered, appearing normal within 1 month of surgery. Eels with similar transections, but given regular, repeated intraperitoneal injections (50 mg/kg) of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) showed an equivalent pattern of decline and recovery that was 10-20 days shorter than that seen in non-treated fish. Axonal growth into the denervated cord, as determined from anterograde labelling experiments, was also more rapid in the drug-treated fish. L-DOPA treatment increased the activity of all fish for up to 18 h, and accelerated the spontaneous movements ('spinal swimming') made by the denervated, caudal portion of the animal that appeared following transection. We suggest that this enhancement of locomotion underlies the accelerated axonal growth and, hence, functional recovery.","dopamine"

It is clear that the techniques of transplantation can be functionally viable under certain well-defined biological circumstances, but significant problems remain in the availability of suitable donor tissues and defining the optimal conditions for reliable survival of the implanted cells.

When exposed to light with appropriate wavelength, action potentials can be triggered in ChR2-expressing neurons, whereas inhibition of action potentials can be obtained in NpHR-expressing neurons, thus allowing for powerful control of neural activity. Optogenetics is now intensively used in laboratory animals, both in vitro and in vivo, for exploring functions of complex neural circuits and information processing in the normal brain and during various neurological conditions.

DA-mediated regulation of urinary activity is considered to occur through an interaction between midbrain DA neurons and the pontine micturition center. Here we show that DA is produced in the rat spinal cord and modulates the bladder reflex. We observed numerous tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)(+) neurons in the autonomic nuclei and superficial dorsal horn in L6-S3 spinal segments. These neurons are dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)(-) and some contain detectable dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), suggesting their capacity to produce DA. Interestingly, following a complete thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) to interrupt supraspinal projections, more TH+ neurons emerged in the lumbosacral spinal cord, coincident with a sustained, low level of DA expression there and a partially recovered micturition reflex. Non-selective blockade of spinal DA receptors reduced bladder activity whereas activation of spinal D-2-like receptors increased bladder activity and facilitated voiding. Additionally, depletion of lumbosacral TH+ neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) decreased bladder non-voiding contractions and voiding efficiency. Furthermore, injecting the transsynaptic neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the bladder detrusor labeled TH+ cells in the lumbosacral cord, confirming their involvement in spinal micturition reflex circuits. These results illustrate that DA is synthesized in the rat spinal cord; plasticity of lumbosacral TH+ neurons following SCI may contribute to DA expression and modulate the spinal bladder reflex. Thus, spinally-derived DA and receptors could be a novel therapeutic target to improve micturition recovery after SCI. Published by Elsevier Inc.","dopamine"

Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) test and MPO activity were used to assess the effect of combination therapy on locomotion and neutrophil infiltration. Inflammation factors, VEGF and BDNF expression, caspase-3 activation, phosphorylation-p38MAPK, proNGF, p75NTR and RhoA expressions were estimated using commercial kits or western blot, respectively. BBB scores were significantly increased and MPO activity was significantly undermined by combination therapy. In addition, combination therapy significantly decreased inflammation factors in SCI rats. Results from western blot showed that combination therapy significantly up-regulated the protein of VEGF and BDNF expression and down-regulated the protein of phosphorylation-p38MAPK, proNGF, p75NTR and RhoA expressions in SCI rats.

In animal models of spinal cord injury, although spontaneous regeneration of descending axons is limited, compensation by intact corticospinal axons, descending tracts from the brainstem, and local intrinsic spinal networks all contribute to the recovery of motor function. Here, we investigated spontaneous motor compensation and plasticity that occur in the absence of corticospinal tract, using Celsr3\Emx1 mice in which the corticospinal tract is completely and specifically absent as a consequence of Celsr3 inactivation in the cortex. Mutant mice had no paresis, but displayed hyperactivity in open-field, and a reduction in skilled movements in food pellet manipulation tests. The number of spinal motoneurons was reduced and their terminal arbors at neuromuscular junctions were atrophic, which was reflected in electromyography deficits. Rubrospinal projections, calretinin-positive propriospinal projections, afferent innervation of motoneurons by calretinin-positive segmental interneurons, and terminal ramifications of monoaminergic projections were significantly increased. Contrary to control animals, mutants also developed a severe and persistent disability of forelimb use following the section of the rubrospinal tract at the C4 spinal level. These observations demonstrate for the first time that the congenital absence of the corticospinal tract induces spontaneous plasticity, both at the level of the motor spinal cord and in descending monoaminergic and rubrospinal projections. Such compensatory mechanisms could be recruited in case of brain or spinal cord lesion or degeneration. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.","dopamine"

A BMT from mice transgenic for green fluorescent protein (GFP(+)) given either before or after administration of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) led to the accumulation of transplanted adult GFP(+) bone-marrow-derived cells (BMDC) in the substantia nigra, where dopaminergic neurodegeneration occurs in PD. Post-BMT, mice exposed to MPTP had substantially greater numbers of endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra and increased dopamine transporter-positive projections into the striatum compared to controls. Moreover, motor function was restored to normal within 1 month post-MPTP in BMT-treated mice assayed by a rotarod behavioral test. The effect of BMT on PD was indirect, as no evidence of BMDC fusion with or transdifferentiation into dopaminergic neurons was observed. BMDC activated by BMT or associated factors could play a trophic role in rescuing damaged cells. Alternatively, the beneficial effects of BMT are due to immunosuppression reflected by a reduction in the proportion of T-cells and a reduction of T-cell proliferation in BMT mice. These findings highlight that when immunosuppression is required for transplantation studies, the amelioration of symptoms may not be due to the transplant itself Further, they suggest that the immune system plays a role in the development of characteristics typical of PD.","dopamine"

Dopamine D1 receptor agonist A-68930 has been reported to exert neuroprotective effect via suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in some central nervous injury models. However, whether A-68930 can exert nueroprotection in rat SCI models through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation has yet to be investigated.Methods.Eighty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group, SCI group, SCI + Vehicle (Veh) group, SCI + A-68930 group. The influences of A-68930 on the proinflammatory cytokines levels, histological changes, and locomotion scale were estimated.Results.SCI significantly promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased proinflammatory cytokines productions in SCI group as compared with sham group.

A promising therapeutic intervention for SCI is the use of neural stem cells. Cell replacement strategies using neural precursor cells (NPCs) and oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) have been shown to replace lost/damaged cells, secrete trophic factors, regulate gliosis and scar formation, reduce cystic cavity size and axonal dieback, as well as to enhance plasticity, axonal elongation and neuroprotection. These progenitor cells can be obtained through a variety of sources, including adult neural tissue, embryonic blastocysts and adult somatic cells via induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology.

Few preclinical models have been used to examine alcohol use across distinct phases of the post-injury period, leaving mechanistic questions unanswered. To address this, the aim of this study was to describe the histological and behavioral outcomes of a noncontusive closed-head TBI in the mouse, after which sensitivity to and consumption of alcohol were quantified, in addition to dopaminergic signaling markers. We hypothesized that TBI would alter alcohol consumption patterns and related signal transduction pathways that were congruent to clinical observations. After midline impact to the skull, latency to right after injury, motor deficits, traumatic axonal injury, and reactive astrogliosis were evaluated in C57BL/6J mice. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation was observed in white matter tracts at 6, 24, and 72 h post-TBI. Increased intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity was observed by 24 h, primarily under the impact site and in the nucleus accumbens, a striatal subregion, as early as 72 h, persisting to 7 days, after TBI. At 14 days post-TBI, when mice were tested for ethanol sensitivity after acute high-dose ethanol (4 g/kg, intraperitoneally), brain-injured mice exhibited increased sedation time compared with uninjured mice, which was accompanied by deficits in striatal dopamine-and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein, 32 kDa (DARPP-32) phosphorylation. At 17 days post-TBI, ethanol intake was assessed using the Drinking-in-the-Dark paradigm. Intake across 7 days of consumption was significantly reduced in TBI mice compared with sham controls, paralleling the reduction in alcohol consumption observed clinically in the initial post-injury period. These data demonstrate that TBI increases sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation and affects downstream signaling mediators of striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission while altering ethanol consumption. Examining TBI effects on ethanol responsitivity will improve our understanding of alcohol use post-TBI in humans.","dopamine"

Signals emanating from the host influence the migration, survival, distribution, and fate of transplanted NSCs, which in turn can create host microenvironments that favor a return to homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of key facilitatory molecules that de. ne the injury niche might enhance this bidirectional stem cell host interaction to therapeutic advantage. As proof of concept, we investigated whether conditioning the niche with the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 might enhance recovery in a prototypical neurodegenerative milieu-the MPTP-induced model of Parkinson's disease in aged mice-where cross-talk between NSCs and imperiled host dopaminergic neurons is known to be pivotal in rescuing the function and connectivity of the latter. In lesioned mice (and in unlesioned controls), we overexpressed L1 in the NSCs to be transplanted into the ventral mesencephalon. Several pairwise experimental combinations were tested based on variations of engrafting L1 overexpressing versus nonoverexpressing NSCs into wild-type (WT) versus L1-overexpressing transgenic mice (specifically L1 transcribed from the GFAP promoter and, hence, overexpressed in host astrocytes). Enrichment for L1-particularly when expressed simultaneously in both donor NSCs and host brain-led to rapid and extensive distribution of exogenous NSCs, which in turn rescued (with an efficacy greater than in nonengineered controls) dysfunctional host dopaminergic nigral neurons, even when grafting was delayed by a month. L1 overexpression by NSCs also enhanced their own differentiation into tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in both WT and transgenic hosts. Graft-host interactions were thus favored by progressively increasing levels of L1. More broadly, this study supports the view that manipulating components of the niche (such as an adhesion molecule) that facilitate cross-talk between stem cells and the dysfunctional brain may offer new strategies for more efficacious neurotransplantation, particularly when treatment is delayed as in chronic lesions or advanced stages of a neurodegenerative disease.

In the presence of OEC, significantly enhanced survival of NSC-derived DA neurons and axonal fiber outgrowth was evident in the striatum of NSC+OEC co-grafted rats at 24 weeks post-grafting as compared with NSC alone grafted rats. The increased survival of NSC and their striatal reinnervation was further manifested in the form of significant and substantial restitution of motor function and neurochemical recovery in the co-grafted group. Significant enhanced expression of p75NTR (from OEC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (from NSC) confirmed the co-localization and survival of both types of cells at the transplantation site in co-grafted rats. Co-grafting results co-related well with our in vitro studies, which suggest that OEC not only significantly increase survival, neurite outgrowth and DA release of NSC-derived DA neuron but also protect against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity in co-culture conditions. These results collectively suggest that OEC increase the survival and function of transplanted NSC in 6-OHDA lesioned parkinsonian rats.","dopamine"

Hemisection alone was found to significantly increase 5-HT levels and significantly decrease DA levels compared to normal controls. Eight of eight saline-injected rats expressed recovery of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve during asphyxia 4 h following hemisection, while only 4/8 rats in the p-CPA-treated group expressed recovery in the ipsilateral nerve. Quantification of integrated phrenic nerve waveforms indicated that the mean amplitude of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve was significantly lower inp-CPA-treated rats than in saline controls. In addition, saline controls demonstrated significant increases in mean respiratory frequency and mean amplitude of contralateral phrenic nerve activity during asphyxia, compared to normocapnia. However, p-CPA-treated rats did not express significant differences in either mean respiratory frequency or mean amplitude of integrated respiratory waveforms during asphyxia, compared to normocapnia.

To better understand the protective effect of GM-CSF on dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigated the effect of GM-CSF on the survival of dopamine neurons and changes in locomotor behavior in a murine PD model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of GM-CSF in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated PC12 cells as well as in embryonic mouse primary mesencephalic neurons (PMNs) in vitro. To investigate the role of GM-CSF in vivo, we prepared a mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) PD model, and examined the effects of GM-CSF on dopaminergic neuron survival in the substantia nigra and on locomotor behavior. Treatment with GM-CSF significantly reduced MPP+-induced dopaminergic cell death in PC12 cells and PMNs in vitro. GM-CSF modulated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2 and Bax, in vitro.

We co-grafted VM with either OEC or astrocytes derived from the same olfactory bulbs as the OEC to rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal system. Co-grafting fetal VM with OEC, but not with astrocytes enhanced dopamine cell survival, striatal reinnervation and functional recovery of amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour compared with grafting embryonic VM alone. Grafting OEC or astrocytes alone had no effects. Intriguingly, only in the presence of OEC co-grafts, did dopamine neurons extend strikingly long neurites that reached peripheral striatal compartments. Comparable results were observed in a co-culture system where OEC promoted dopamine cell survival and neurite elongation through a mechanism involving both releasable factors and direct contact. Cell type analysis of fetal VM grafts suggested that dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra rather than of the ventral tegmental area were increased in the presence of OEC co-grafts.

The clinical outcomes have been variable, perhaps partly because of the differing levels of preclinical, basic experimental evidence that was available prior to the trials. The most promising results have been seen in PD trials, with encouraging ones in HD. A common feature of most trials is that they have concentrated on the biological and technical aspects of transplantation without presupposing that the outcomes might be influenced by events after the surgery. The growing evidence of plasticity demonstrated by the brain and grafts in response to environmental and training stimuli such as rehabilitation interventions has been mostly neglected throughout the clinical application of cell therapy. This review suggests that a different approach may be required to maximize recovery: postoperative experiences, including rehabilitation with explicit behavioral retraining, could have marked direct as well as positive secondary effects on the integration and function of grafted cells in the host neural system. The knowledge gained about brain plasticity following brain damage needs to be linked with what we know about promoting intrinsic recovery processes and how this can boost neurobiological and surgical strategies for repair at the clinical level. With proof of principle now established, a rich area for innovative research with profound therapeutic application is open for investigation.","dopamine"

Because many neuronal functions depend on astrocytic support, we developed a heterochronic co-culture system to study influences of aging astrocytes on neurons. Neurite outgrowth by embryonic neurons (E18) was markedly less when co-cultured with confluent astrocytes derived from old (24 mo) versus young (3 mo) cortex. These impairments were reversible. Diminishing the GFAP levels of old astrocytes by RNAi restored neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression of GEAP in young astrocytes modeled these effects of aging by reducing neurite outgrowth. Quantitative relationships were found such that neurites were co-localized with high intensity laminin, which both varied inversely with GFAP.

In this work, we aimed to investigate whether transplanted MN could prevent motor deterioration in transgenic rats expressing a mutant form of human superoxide dismutase I (hSOD1(G93A)) associated with inherited ALS. Mouse ES cells were differentiated to neurons that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the promoter of the MN-specific gene 09, as well as molecular markers indicative of MN identity. Cells were grafted into the lumbar spinal cord of adult wild-type (WT) or hSOD1(G93A) rats at 10 weeks of age, when transgenic animals are presymptomatic. Grafted cells with MN phenotype can survive for at least I week in hSOD1(G93A) animals. To quantitatively evaluate motor performance of WT and transgenic rats, we carried out weekly rotarod tests starting when the animals were 14 weeks old. Sham and grafted WT animals showed no decline in their ability to sustain themselves on the rotating rod. In contrast, sham hSOD1(G93A) rats decreased in motor performance from week 16 onwards, reaching paralysis by week 19 of age. In grafted transgenic animals, there was a significant improvement in rotarod competence at weeks 16 and 17 when compared to sham hSOD1(G93A). However, in the following weeks, transplanted hSOD1(G93A) rats showed motor deterioration and eventually exhibited paralysis by week 19. At end-stage, we found only a few endogenous MN in sham and grafted hSOD1(G93A) rats by cresyl violet staining; no choline acetyl transferase-positive nor GFP-positive MN were present in grafted transgenic subjects. In contrast, WT rats analyzed at the same age possessed grafted GFP-positive MN in their spinal cords.

Protection of nigral dopamine neurons from progressive degenerative death and cell replacement of novel dopamine neurons are hopeful strategies against PD in humans. The reactive astrocytes or functional activation of astrocytes abundantly occurred in brain insults including trauma, ischemia, and 6-OHDA or MPTP-treated PD animal models. Although they were traditionally assumed to impede neuronal regeneration by forming glial scars, growing evidence has indicated that reactive astrocytes do offer crucial benefits in functional recovery of brain injuries. The reactive astrocytes can produce various neurotrophic factors for neuron survival, synthesize extracellular substrates for axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis, act as scavengers for free radical and excess glutamate, and promote neurogenesis of neural progenitor cells in the adult brains. We thereafter hypothesize that reactive astrocytes may also play important roles in the protection of nigral dopamine neurons or transplanted dopamine cells through their neurotrophic functions and active interaction with dopamine neurons or neural progenitor cells. Future approaches deserve to target on neurotrophic functions of reactive astrocytes in the basal ganglia and interventions to facilitate survival and axonal regeneration of dopamine neurons or differentiation of dopamine progenitor cells. Novel pharmaceutical and cell replacement strategies will hopefully be developed by potential manipulation of reactive astrocytes in the basal ganglia in prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease.","dopamine"

The therapeutic potential of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), the most potent neurotrophic factor for DA neurons, has been demonstrated in many experimental models of PD. However, chronic delivery of GDNF to DA neurons in the brain remains an unmet challenge. Here, we report the effects of GDNF-releasing Notch-induced human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) grafted into striatum of the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) progressively lesioned rat model of PD. Human MSC, obtained from bone marrow aspirates of young, healthy adult volunteers, were transiently transfected with the intracellular domain of the Notch1 gene (NICD) to generate SB623 cells. SB623 cells expressing GDNF and/or humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) following lentiviral transduction or nontransduced cells were stereotaxically placed into rat striatum 1 week after a unilateral partial 6-OHDA striatal lesion. At 4 weeks, rats that had received GDNF-transduced SB623 cells had significantly decreased amphetamine-induced rotation compared with control rats, although this effect was not observed in rats that received GFP-transduced or nontransduced SB623 cells. At 5 weeks, rejuvenated tyrosine hydroxylase-imnnunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers that appeared to be host DA axons were observed in and around grafts. This effect was more prominent in rats that received GDNF-secreting cells and was not observed in controls. These observations suggest that human bone-marrow derived MSC, genetically modified to secrete GDNF, hold potential as an allogeneic or autologous stem cell therapy for PD.

We tested this approach using a recently developed a mammalian SCI model of chronic central pain, which results in development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. Thirty day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally hemisected at T13 and allowed 4 weeks for recovery of locomotor function and development of allodynia.

Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity indicated prolonged transplant survival and production of catecholamines.

Much research has been done in rodents, and a few studies have been done in nonhuman primate models. Early uncontrolled clinical reports were enthusiastic, but the outcome of the first randomized, double blind, controlled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure Parkinson's disease, although there were some significant positive findings. Were the earlier animal studies and clinical reports wrong? Should we give up on the goal? Some aspects of the trial design and implantation methods may have led to lack of effects and to some side effects such as dyskinesias. But a detailed review of clinical neural transplants published to date still suggests that neural transplantation variably reverses some aspects of Parkinson's disease, although differing methods make exact comparisons difficult. While the randomized clinical studies have been in progress, new methods have shown promise for increasing transplant survival and distribution, reconstructing the circuits to provide dopamine to the appropriate targets and with normal regulation. Selected promising new strategies are reviewed that block apoptosis induced by tissue dissection, promote vascularization of grafts, reduce oxidant stress, provide key growth factors, and counteract adverse effects of increased age. New sources of replacement cells and stem cells may provide additional advantages for the future.

In this study we investigated features of walking and turning in a rat model of PD caused by unilateral infusion of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). We assessed gait and electromyographic (EMG) patterns of the ankle flexor tibialis anterior and the knee extensor vastus lateralis of the hindlimb, and triceps brachii of the forelimb, during overgound locomotion, spontaneous rotation (turning) and apomorphine-induced rotation. When compared with control rats, rats with unilateral dopamine depletion displayed a shuffling gait and short stride lengths. This locomotor pattern was accompanied by prolonged ankle flexor activity on the ipsilateral side, and prolonged activity of knee extensors on the contralateral side. The dopamine depletion also led to enhanced contraversive rotations after an apomorphine challenge. The EMG recordings during drug-induced rotation suggested that hindlimb stepping was a reflective response to an active drive produced by forelimbs. The EMG recordings of the contralateral side during rotation were marked by reduced ankle flexor activity and increased knee extensor activity. Furthermore, EMG recordings indicated that dopamine-agonists induce rotational bias by altering the coupling between ipsi- and contralateral hindlimbs, and between forelimbs. In straight walking, however, the gait of 6-OHDA lesion animals reflected normal, coupled hindlimb stepping as controlled by spinal pattern generators. The data suggest that the unilateral rat model of PD resembles key features of human parkinsonian gait, and that asymmetric descending input may underlie the observed changes in gait patterns.","dopamine"

Neuromodulators play a key role in contributing to network flexibility in a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate networks. For example, neuromodulators contribute to altering intrinsic properties and synaptic weights that, in extreme cases, can lead to neurons switching between networks. Here we focus on the role of dopamine in the control of stepping networks in the spinal cord. We first review the role of dopamine in modulating rhythmic activity in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and the leech, since work from these preparations provides a foundation to understand its role in vertebrate systems. We then move to a discussion of dopamine's role in modulation of swimming in aquatic species such as the larval xenopus, lamprey and zebrafish. The control of terrestrial walking in vertebrates by dopamine is less studied and we review current evidence in mammals with a focus on rodent species. We discuss data suggesting that the source of dopamine within the spinal cord is mainly from the All area of the diencephalon, and then turn to a discussion of dopamine's role in modulating walking patterns from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. Similar to the descending serotonergic system, the dopaminergic system may serve as a potential target to promote recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury (SCI); evidence suggests that dopaminergic agonists can promote recovery of function following SCI. We discuss pharrnacogenetic and optogenetic approaches that could be deployed in SCI and their potential tractability. Throughout the review we draw parallels with both noradrenergic and serotonergic modulatory effects on spinal cord networks.

We designed and tested an apparatus for optically stimulating ChR2-ESCs during chronic neuronal differentiation, with high-speed optical switching on a custom robotic stage with environmental chamber for automated stimulation and imaging over days, with tracking for increased expression of neural and neuronal markers. These data point to potential uses of ChR2 technology for chronic and temporally precise noninvasive optical control of ESCs both in vitro and in vivo, ranging from noninvasive control of stem cell differentiation to causal assessment of the specific contribution of transplanted cells to tissue and network function.

The narrow beam test examines the ability of a rat to cross a narrow, elevated beam of wood or other material. In order to determine the utility of the narrow beam test in the study of Parkinsonism, it was of interest to characterise the performance of animals at this task. Rats were placed at one end of a 105 cm long, elevated beam and both the time it took to begin crossing the beam, as well as the total time taken to cross the beam, were measured. The effects of training, time of day and 6-hydroxydopamine lesion on beam performance were examined. Rats reached maximal performance at the task within a single test session and time of day had no effect on beam performance. Parkinsonian rats demonstrated a four-fold increase in both the latency to initiate the task and the total time to cross the beam (p < 0.05). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","dopamine"

Currently, ESC-based nervous system repair faces several problems. One major hurdle is related to problems in generating large and defined populations of the desired types of neurons from human ESCs (hESCs). Moreover, survival of grafted hESC-derived cells has varied and functional recovery in recipient animals has often been disappointing. Importantly, in clinical trials, adverse effects after surgery, including tumors or vigorous immune reactions, must be avoided. Here we highlight attempts to overcome these hurdles with hESCs intended for central nervous system repair. We focus on hESC-derived dopamine-producing neurons that can be grafted in Parkinson's disease and identify critical experiments that need to be conducted before clinical trials can occur.","dopamine"

Here we examined the effects of compulsive exercise on Parkinson's disease model of rats. Before 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 20 mu g) lesion into the right striatum of female SD rats, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected to label the proliferating cells. Subsequently, at 24 h after the lesion, the rats were forced to run on the treadmill (5 days/week, 30 min/day, 11 m/min). As behavioral evaluations, cylinder test was performed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and amphetamine-induced rotational test was per-formed at 2 and 4 weeks with consequent euthanasia for immunohistochemical investigations. The exercise group showed better behavioral recovery in cylinder test and significant decrease in the number of amphetamine-induced rotations, compared to the non-exercise group. Correspondingly, significant preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers in the striatum and TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was demonstrated, compared to the non-exercise group. Additionally, the number of migrated BrdU- and Doublecortin-positive cells toward the lesioned striatum was increased in the exercise group. Furthermore, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor increased in the striatum by exercise. The results suggest that exercise exerts neuroprotective effects or enhances the neuronal differentiation in Parkinson's disease model of rats with subsequent improvement in deteriorated motor function.

Rats spontaneously walk from a starting location to a goal along a horizontal ladder. The spacing between the rungs of the ladder is variable and can be changed to prevent the animal from learning either the absolute or relative location of the rungs. The testing procedure requires minimal training and allows detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis using video recording. The utility of the test is described with postoperative data obtained from animals with unilateral neocortical strokes produced by pial stripping over the motor cortex, neonatal and adult unilateral corticospinal tract lesions produced by tract section at the pyramids, and unilateral dopamine depletions produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle. In addition, a group of aged rats was examined. Deficits in limb placing, stepping and co-ordination displayed by the animals demonstrate that this test can discriminate between lesions of the motor system or age-associated impairments. The test is useful for assessing loss and recovery of function due to brain or spinal cord injury. the effectiveness of treatment therapies, as well as compensatory processes through which animals adapt to nervous system injury.

However, its exact repair mechanisms are still under investigation. The authors of this present study hypothesized that chronic stress plays an important role in SCI and investigated a potential anti-chronic stress mechanism of transplantation of BMSCs into rat SCI. A total of 48 adult male SD rats were randomly and equally allocated into three groups (control, model, and treatment). Lower thoracic partial SCI was induced in both the model and treatment group, while the control group received only laminectomy. The control and treatment group were injected with 100 mu l of Hank's buffered saline solution containing 1 million rat BMSCs into the L4-5 intervertebral space. The model group received the same amount of Hank's buffered saline solution via injection. Hind limb motor function was evaluated by Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection was performed for these stress-related hormones: plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and serum corticosterone (CORT). Immunohistochemistry staining was performed for Glutamate (Glu) receptor 1 (GluR1) in the hippocampus and amygdala of rat brains. Following BMSCs transplantation, motor function of hind limbs of rats in the treatment group achieved sustained restoration. Additionally, 14 days and 28 days after transplantation, levels of plasma ACTH, NE, E, and serum CORT in the treatment group were significantly decreased compared with that in the model group (P<0.05). Positive rates of GluR1 in the hippocampus and amygdala of the treatment group were also dramatically reduced compared with that in the model group (P<0.05). Results showed that BMSCs transplantation is beneficial for motor function recovery of hind limbs in rats with SCI. Furthermore, it may exert a preventive role on chronic stress by downregulating GluR1 expression in the central nervous alpha-amino hydroxymethyl-oxazole propionic acid (AMPA) channel and inhibiting secretion of stress-related hormones, implying a potential anti-chronic mechanism.","epinephrine"

Neurophysiological and neu-roprosthetic research have the potential to improve quality of life for these patients; however, the lack of an ethical and sustainable nonhuman primate model for paraplegia hinders their advancement. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team developed a way to induce temporary paralysis in awake behaving macaques by creating a fully implantable lumbar epidural catheter-subcutaneous port system that enables easy and reliable targeted drug delivery for sensorimotor blockade. During treadmill walking, aliquots of 1.5% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine were percutaneously injected into the ports of three rhesus macaques while surface electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity from their quadriceps and gastrocnemii. Diminution of EMG amplitude, loss of voluntary leg movement, and inability to bear weight were achieved for 60-90 min in each animal, followed by a complete recovery of function. The monkeys remained alert and cooperative during the paralysis trials and continued to take food rewards, and the ports remained functional after several months. This technique will enable recording from the cortex and/or spinal cord in awake behaving nonhuman primates during the onset, maintenance, and resolution of paraplegia for the first time, thus opening the door to answering basic neurophysiological questions about the acute neurological response to spinal cord injury and recovery. It will also negate the need to permanently injure otherwise high-value research animals for certain experimental paradigms aimed at developing and testing neural interface decoding algorithms for patients with lower extremity dysfunction.","epinephrine"

To reduce allodynia, it would be desirable to implant a permanent biological pump such as adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (AM), which secrete catecholamines and opioid peptides, both antinociceptive substances, near the spinal cord. We tested this approach using a recently developed a mammalian SCI model of chronic central pain, which results in development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. Thirty day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were spinally hemisected at T13 and allowed 4 weeks for recovery of locomotor function and development of allodynia. Nonimmunosuppressed injured animals received either control-striated muscle (n = 7) or AM (n = 10) transplants. Nociceptive behavior was tested for 4 weeks posttransplant as measured by paw withdrawals to von Frey filaments, radiant heat, and pin prick stimuli. Hemisected animals receiving AM demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both fore- and hindlimb mechanical and thermal allodynia, but not analgesia, when compared to hemisected animals receiving striated muscle transplants (P < 0.05). Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity indicated prolonged transplant survival and production of catecholamines. HPLC analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples from animals receiving AM transplants demonstrated statistically significant increases in levels of dopamine (sevenfold), norepinephrine (twofold), and epinephrine (threefold), compared to control values several weeks following transplant (P < 0.05). By 28 days posttransplant, however, antinociceptive effects were diminished. These results support the therapeutic potential of transplanted AM in reducing chronic central pain following spinal cord injury, (C) 2000 Academic Press.","epinephrine"

Gene expression profiles of GSE125630 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and comprised 14 spinal cord tissues, including contusion SCI group (n = 6, unexercised), complete transection group (n = 4, unexercised), and uninjured control group (n = 4, unexercised). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) and time-series gene investigations, functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, characteristic gene-related disease analysis, and TF-target gene interaction studies were performed. A total of 122 DEGs and 409 DEGs were respectively identified in contusion SCI versus control group and complete transection versus control group, respectively. The PPI network investigated 16 characteristic genes including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and neurotensin (NTS). These genes were mainly enriched in functions involving response to ethanol, corticosterone, and estradiol. Eventually, a TF-target gene interaction network was constructed with nine TFs [including activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)] and 10 characteristic genes. The results indicate that regulation of osteoblast differentiation and positive regulation of the BMP signaling pathway may be suppressed in the process of SCI. TH may play a pivotal role in the progression of SCI. In addition, DEGs such as CRH and NTS may be novel targets for SCI therapy.","ethanol"

The patient collapsed within the hospital 30 minutes after the CT scan was done, and remained comatose until death, showing no improvement with symptomatic treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine done 6 days after admission revealed bilaterally symmetrical hyperintensities involving the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and white matter, basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem on T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted images; similar hyperintensities were seen involving the swollen and edematous cervical spinal cord and cerebellar tonsillar herniation compressing the proximal cervical cord. Petechial hemorrhages were also noted within the brainstem. These features are compatible with toxic injury to the brain and cervical spinal cord. To our knowledge, the magnetic resonance imaging features of brain and spinal cord injury and cerebellar tonsillar herniation, secondary to isopropanol intoxication have not been reported in the published literature before.","ethanol"

Therefore, the biological and scientific clinical follow-up of traumatized vertebro-medullary patients is of particular importance. With the approval of the Bioethics Commission of the Bagdasar Arseni Emergency Clinical Hospital (TEHBA) Bucharest (number 9181 dated April 11, 2018), we will present the special case of a patient admitted to the Neuromuscular Recovery Clinic of THEBA for incomplete tetraplegia motor deficit AIS/Frankel D, with neurologic level C6 after a vertebral-medullary trauma (produced in conditions of ethanol abuse) and with parieto-occipital ischemic vascular accident produced simultaneously. The peculiarities of this case are the possible (but less common) immediate consequences of vertebral-medullary traumas: paravertebral nervous ganglion lesions; arterial (carotid / vertebral) dissections, which can cause ischemic lesions, all requiring appropriate clinical and therapeutic management. Spinal cord injuries can be favored by toxic-nutritional abuse and may have immediate, late, and permanent morpho-physiological consequences.

Melatonin (MT) has been shown to have good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Chondroitin sulfate ABC (ChABC) has been shown to metabolize chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and can reduce colloidal scar formation. However, the effect of any of these drugs alone in the recovery of nerve function after injury is not completely satisfactory. Therefore, this experiment aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of combined application of melatonin and chondroitin sulfate ABC on nerve regeneration and functional recovery after nerve-root avulsion of the brachial plexus. Fifty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and their C5-7 nerve roots were avulsed. Then, the C6 nerve roots were replanted to construct the brachial plexus nerve-root avulsion model. After successful modeling, the injured rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group (injury) did not receive any drug treatment, but was treated with a pure gel-sponge carrier nerve-root implantation and an ethanol-saline solution via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The second group (melatonin) was treated with melatonin via i.p. injection. The third group (chondroitin sulfate ABC) was treated with chondroitin sulfate ABC through local administration. The fourth group (melatonin + chondroitin sulfate ABC) was treated with melatonin through i.p. injection and chondroitin sulfate ABC through local administration. The upper limb Terzis grooming test was used 2-6 weeks after injury to evaluate motor function. Inflammation and oxidative damage within 24 hours of injury were evaluated by spectrophotometry. Immunofluorescence and neuroelectrophysiology were used to evaluate glial scar, neuronal protection, and nerve regeneration. The results showed that the Terzis grooming-test scores of the three groups that received treatment were better than those of the injury only group. Additionally, these three groups showed lower levels of C5-7 intramedullary peroxidase and malondialdehyde. Further, glial scar tissue in the C6 spinal segment was smaller and the number of motor neurons was greater. The endplate area of the biceps muscle was larger and the structure was clear. The latency of the compound potential of the myocutaneous nerve-biceps muscle was shorter. All these indexes were even greater in the melatonin + chondroitin sulfate ABC group than in the melatonin only or chondroitin sulfate ABC only groups. Thus, the results showed that melatonin combined with chondroitin sulfate ABC can promote nerve regeneration after nerve-root avulsion injury of the brachial plexus, which may be achieved by reducing oxidative damage and inflammatory reaction in the injury area and inhibiting glial scar formation.","ethanol"

Given this, an examination of whether blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is a potential determinant of survival and neurological and functional recovery after acute traumatic SCI was carried out. Methods All patients who were enrolled in the Third National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-3) were included. The study population was divided into non-alcohol' (BAC equal to 0 parts per thousand), legal' (BAC greater than 0 up to 0.8 parts per thousand) and illegal' (BAC greater than 0.8 parts per thousand) subgroups. Outcome measures included survival, NASCIS motor and sensory scores, NASCIS pain scores and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) determinants at baseline and at 6weeks, 6months and 1year post-SCI. Analyses were adjusted for major potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, trial protocol, Glasgow coma score, and cause, level and severity of SCI. Results Among 499 patients (423 males and 76 females; ages from 14 to 92years), the mean BAC was 0.054 +/- 0.006 parts per thousand (range 0-1). The survival at 1year (94.4%) was not associated with the BAC (P=0.374). Moreover, BAC was not significantly correlated with motor recovery (0.166), sensory recovery (0.323), change in pain score (0.312) or functional recovery (0.133) at 6weeks, 6months and 1year post-SCI. Conclusions Our results, for the first time, show that the BAC at emergency admission does not adversely affect the patients' mortality, neurological impairment or functional disability over the course of the first year after SCI.","ethanol"

One of the main problems of chondroitinase ABC1 is its low thermal stability. The objective of the current study was to stabilize the enzyme through entrapment within porous silicon (pSi) nanoparticles. pSi was prepared by an electrochemical etch of p-type silicon using hydrofluoric acid/ethanol. The size of nanoparticles were determined 180 nm by dynamic light scattering and the mean pore diameter was in the range of 40-60 nm obtained by scanning electron microscopy. Enzymes were immobilized on porouse silicon nanoparticles by entrapment. The capacity of matrix was 35 mu g enzyme per 1 mg of silicon. The immobilized enzyme displayed lower V-max values compared to the free enzyme, but Km values were the same for both enzymes. Immobilization significantly increased the enzyme stability at various temperatures (-20, 4, 25 and 37 degrees C). For example, at 4 degrees C, the free enzyme (in 10 mM imidazole) retained 20% of its activity after 100 min, while the immobilized one retained 50% of its initial activity. Nanoparticles loading capacity and the enzyme release rate showed that the selected particles could be a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for chondroitinase. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Survival rates were reduced and posttraumatic neurologic function worsened in ethanol-treated as compared with saline-treated controls. Ethanol-treated rats had significantly lower tissue levels of excitatory amino acids and higher levels of free fatty acids, thromboxane, and lactic acid than did controls. Tissue magnesium concentration was significantly reduced by trauma and recovered more slowly in ethanol-treated rats. Enhanced phospholipid hydrolysis with free fatty acid and thromboxane accumulation, increased release of excitatory amino acids, and decreased tissue magnesium levels may each serve to worsen secondary tissue damage and diminish neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury associated with acute alcohol intoxication.","ethanol"

Tissue engineering approaches by coalescing biomaterials and stem cells offer a promising future for treating spinal cord injury. Here we investigated human endometrial stem cells (hEnSCs) as our cell source. Electrospun poly epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were used for hEnSC adhesion and growth. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the attachment and survival of stem cells on the PCL scaffolds. The scaffold-stem cell construct was transplanted into the hemisected spinal cords of adult male rats. Crocin, an ethanol-extractable component of Crocus sativus L., was administered to rats for 15 consecutive days post injury. Neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration were investigated using immunohistochemical staining for neurofilament marker NF-H and luxol-fast blue (LFB) staining, respectively. TNF-alpha staining was performed to determine the inflammatory response in each group. Functional recovery was assessed via the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale. Results showed that PCL scaffolds seeded with hEnSCs restored the continuity of the damaged spinal cord and decreased cavity formation. Additionally, hEnSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to the functional recovery of the spinal cord. Hence, hEnSC-seeded PCL scaffolds may serve as promising transplants for spinal cord tissue engineering purposes. Furthermore, crocin had an augmenting effect on spinal cord regeneration and proved to exert neuroprotective effects on damaged neurons and may be further studied as a promising drug for spinal cord injury.","ethanol"

Daily administration of EECP after the spinal cord injury ameliorated the locomotor function, which effect was accompanied by a reduced lesion size. Furthermore, the EECP suppressed iNOS gene expression, thus reducingNOgeneration, and also increased the expression level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 mRNAs in the lesion site, suggesting that the EECP reduced the inflammatory and apoptotic circumstances through attenuation of iNOS mRNA expression and facilitation of mRNA expression of neurotrophins in the injured spinal cord. These results suggest that Chinese propolis may become a promising tool for wide use in the nervous system for reducing the secondary neuronal damage following primary physical injury.","ethanol"

Few preclinical models have been used to examine alcohol use across distinct phases of the post-injury period, leaving mechanistic questions unanswered. To address this, the aim of this study was to describe the histological and behavioral outcomes of a noncontusive closed-head TBI in the mouse, after which sensitivity to and consumption of alcohol were quantified, in addition to dopaminergic signaling markers. We hypothesized that TBI would alter alcohol consumption patterns and related signal transduction pathways that were congruent to clinical observations. After midline impact to the skull, latency to right after injury, motor deficits, traumatic axonal injury, and reactive astrogliosis were evaluated in C57BL/6J mice. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation was observed in white matter tracts at 6, 24, and 72 h post-TBI. Increased intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity was observed by 24 h, primarily under the impact site and in the nucleus accumbens, a striatal subregion, as early as 72 h, persisting to 7 days, after TBI. At 14 days post-TBI, when mice were tested for ethanol sensitivity after acute high-dose ethanol (4 g/kg, intraperitoneally), brain-injured mice exhibited increased sedation time compared with uninjured mice, which was accompanied by deficits in striatal dopamine-and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein, 32 kDa (DARPP-32) phosphorylation. At 17 days post-TBI, ethanol intake was assessed using the Drinking-in-the-Dark paradigm. Intake across 7 days of consumption was significantly reduced in TBI mice compared with sham controls, paralleling the reduction in alcohol consumption observed clinically in the initial post-injury period. These data demonstrate that TBI increases sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation and affects downstream signaling mediators of striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission while altering ethanol consumption. Examining TBI effects on ethanol responsitivity will improve our understanding of alcohol use post-TBI in humans.","ethanol"

In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of total ethanol extract of Scutellaria baicalensis (EESB), after SCI. Using primary microglial cultures, EESB treatment significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of such inflammatory mediators as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production were significantly attenuated by EESB treatment. For in vivo study, rats that had received a moderate spinal cord contusion injury at T9 received EESB orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg. EESB inhibited expression of proinflammatory factors and protein carbonylation and nitration after SCI. EESB also inhibited microglial activation at 4 h after injury. Furthermore, EESB significantly inhibited apoptotic cell death of neurons and oligodendrocytes and improved functional recovery after SCI. Lesion cavity and myelin loss were also reduced following EESB treatment.

The current study sought to determine the optimal neuroprotective dose, route and therapeutic window for Rolipram following contusive SCI in rat as well as its prominent PDE target and putative mechanism of protection. Rolipram or vehicle control (10% ethanol) was given subcutaneously (s.c.) daily for 2 wk post-injury (PI) after which the preservation of oligodendrocytes, neurons and central myelinated axons was stereologically assessed. Doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg (given at 1 h PI) increased neuronal survival; 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg/kg protected oligodendrocytes and 1.0 mg/kg produced optimal preservation of central myelinated axons. Ethanol also demonstrated significant neuronal and oligo-protection; though the preservation provided was significantly less than Rolipram. Subsequent use of this optimal Rolipram dose, 1.0 mg/kg, via different routes (i.v., s.c. or oral, 1 h PI), demonstrated that i.v. administration produced the most significant and consistent cyto- and axo-protection, although all routes were effective. Examination of the therapeutic window for i. v. Rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), when initiated between 1 and 48 h after SCI, revealed maximal neuroprotection at 2 h post-SCI, although the protective efficacy of Rolipram could still be observed when administration was delayed for up to 48 h PI. Importantly, use of the optimal Rolipram regimen significantly improved locomotor function after SCI as measured by the BBB score. Lastly we show SCI-induced changes in PDE4A, B and D expression and phosphorylation as well as cytokine expression and immune cell infiltration. We demonstrate that Rolipram abrogates SCI-induced PDE4B1 and PDE4A5 production, PDE4A5 phosphorylation, MCP-1 expression and immune cell infiltration, while preventing post-injury reductions in IL-10. This work supports the use of Rolipram as an acute neuroprotectant following SCI and defines an optimal administration protocol and target for its therapeutic application.","ethanol"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Methylprednisolone (NIP), by reducing edema and protecting the cell membrane against peroxidation, is the only pharmacological agent with a proven clinically beneficial effect on SCI. Melatonin, known as a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have an effect on lipid peroxidation following experimental SCI. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of MP and melatonin on neurological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological recovery. Female albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into five groups of 18 rats each and six rats for the control group. Weight-drop trauma was performed for each group and a 30-mg/kg single dose of NIP for rats in group 1, a 10-mg/kg single dose of melatonin for rats in group 2, and MP and melatonin in the same doses for rats in group 3 were administered immediately after trauma. The rats in group 4 were the vehicle group (treated with ethanol) and group 5 was the trauma group. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded at the 4th hour, the 24th hour, and on the 10th day of the study for six rats in each group. Posttraumatic neurological recovery was recorded for 10 days using ""motor function score"" and inclined plane test. After electrophysiological study the rats were terminated for an analysis of lipid peroxidation level of the injured site of the spinal cord. Electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the effects of melatonin, MP, and the combined treatment with MP and melatonin on axons, neurons, myelin, nucleus, and intracytoplasmic edema. The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","ethanol"

The treatment with oleuropein aglycone significantly decreased: (1) histological damage, (2) motor recovery, (3) nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B expression and IKB-alpha degradation, (4) protein kinase A (PKA) activity and expression, (5) pro-inflammatory cytokines production such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), 6) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, (7) neutrophil infiltration, (8) lipid peroxidation, (9) nitrotyrosine and poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) formation, (10) glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels, (11) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, FAS ligand expression, Caspase 3, Bax and Bcl-2 expression). Thus, we propose that olive oil phenolic constituents such as oleuropein aglycone may be useful in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Male Wistar albino rats weighing 200-250 g were randomized into six groups. Weight-drop trauma was performed for SCI. Group 1 underwent laminectomy alone. Group 2 underwent laminectomy followed by SCI. Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and received resveratrol (100 mg/kg), methylprednisolone (MP) (30 mg/kg), resveratrol (100 mg/kg) plus MP (30 mg/kg), and ethanol (2%), respectively. The rats were divided into two subgroups for biochemical analysis (killed at 24 h after surgery) and for neurobehavioral and histopathological evaluation (killed at 6 weeks after surgery). Posttraumatic neurological recovery after surgery was recorded weekly. Results: Groups 3 and 5 revealed significantly lower malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, xanthine oxidase, and higher glutathione levels than group 4 (P < 0.05). Neurological recovery rates were significantly better in groups 3 and 5 than group 4 (P < 0.05). When spinal trauma size ratios were compared, there was no significant difference between treatment groups. Conclusion: Resveratrol treatment revealed better biochemical recovery in the acute stage of trauma than MP treatment. Although resveratrol and combined treatment revealed better neurobehavioral recovery than MP treatment; resveratrol, MP, and combined treatment modalities improved histopathological recovery at the same level in the final stage of the experiment. Future studies involving different doses of resveratrol and different doses combinations with MP could promise better results as each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","ethanol"

METHODS: The weight-dropping method was used to produce the experimental SCI in adult rats. Res (50, 100 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (MPSS) 100 mg/kg were injected ip immediately after the induction of SCI. The effects of Res on edema, LDH, Na+, K+-ATPase, and MDA were determined at 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h after SCI compared with MPSS. The electron microscope was employed to investigate the ultrastructural effects of Res on axons, neurons, and subcellular organelles after SCI. RESULTS: Res obviously inhibited the secondary spinal cord edema with the most remarkable suppressing rate by 11.5 % at 48 h. Res significantly suppressed the activities of the lactate dehydrogenase with the highest suppressing rate > 40 % at 24 h. Res markedly improved the Na+, K+-ATPase activities that were promoted to the biggest extent of 60 % at 48 h. At the same time, Res (50 and 100 mg/kg) obviously reduced MDA production in the injured spinal cord tissue in comparison with the SCI model, the most remarkable effect of Res was detected at 48 h with the inhibitory rate >40 %. The ultrastructural findings suggested that SCI caused profound spinal cord damage, which could be protected or improved by injection of Res and MPSS. CONCLUSION: Both Res and MPSS effectively protected the spinal cord from secondary spinal cord injures. But the effects of Res 50 and 100 mg/kg were stronger in improving the energy metabolism system and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation in the local injured spinal cord after SCI than MPSS at the dose of 100 mg/kg. Res might have greatly potent therapeutic effects on SCI.","ethanol"

We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Ezetimibe (Eze) in SCI and identify the underlying mechanisms. Acute SCI rat model was established by using the modified weight-drop method. Following administration with Eze, the neurological function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale score, and the motor neurons were stained with Nissl staining. The pathological changes of spinal cord tissues were tested using Hematoxylin and eosin staining. The presence of apoptotic cells was examined using Terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Moreover, the expression of main autophagy markers LC3II/I, Beclin1 and p62 and apoptosis-related proteins was tested using western blot analysis. The changes of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling-associated proteins were measured. Experimental results showed that Eze treatment obviously improved functional recovery, the neuronal survival and morphological characteristics of spinal cord. Additionally, Eze administration dramatically upregulated the expression of LC3II/I and Beclin1 whereas downregulated that of p62. Concurrently, significantly reduced apoptosis was observed following Eze intervention, accompanied by increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9. Further results indicated that Eze treatment remarkably suppressed the expression of phospho-PI3K (p-PI3K), p-AKT and p-mTOR. These findings demonstrated that Eze could protect against SCI by activating autophagy and hindering apoptosis through regulating PI3K/AKT/ mTOR signaling, suggesting a potential candidate for SCI therapy.","ezetimibe"

These inflammatory responses spread the damage to the neural cells and impair the recovery of neurological functions. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin and a simvastatin-ezetimibe combination therapy in managing the endothelial inflammatory response in an SCI rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were group-housed and SCI was induced by using the modified weight-drop method. The animals were divided into 4 groups: (1) sham group, laminectomy only (n=6); (2) no-treatment group, SCI without therapy (n=8); (3) simvastatin group (n=8), and (4) ezetimibe and simvastatin combination therapy group (n=8). A high dose (15 mg/kg) of simvastatin was given to the simvastatin group, and 10 mg/kg simvastatin and 10 mg/kg ezetimibe were given to the combination group. Neurological function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale score. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level was used as an SCI biomarker. ICAM-1 level was the highest at 72 hours after SCI in the no-treament group. The treatment groups showed significant reduction in ICAM-1 levels at 72 hours. The treatment groups, especially the combination treatment group, showed better neurological function scores. Simvastatin and simvastatin- ezetimibe all could improve the neurological function and attenuate the endothelial inflammatory response after spinal cord injury in rat.","ezetimibe"

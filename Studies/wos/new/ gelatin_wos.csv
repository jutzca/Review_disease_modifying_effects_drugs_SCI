Secondary damage after SCI initiates cascade of events that creates an inhibitory milieu for axonal growth and repair. Combinatorial therapies are the hope to attenuate secondary injury progression and make the microenvironment growth and repair friendly for the neurons. We fabricated gelatin- genipin hydrogel system which was impregnated with IONPs and injected at the lesion site in a clinically relevant contusion rat model of SCI. 24 h later, the rats were exposed to magnetic fields (17.96 mu T, 50 Hz uniform EMF) for 2 h/day for 5 weeks. A significant (P < 0.001) improvement in Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor score, amplitude and threshold of spinally mediated reflexes and motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (MEP & SSEP) was observed following IONPs implantation and EMF exposure. Moreover, retrograde tracing showed a higher level of neuronal connectivity and survival after the intervention. There was also a reduction in activated microglia and lesion volume which attenuate secondary damage as evident by reduction in the scaring following intervention for 5 weeks. Moreover, we observed increase in the neuronal growth cone marker, GAP-43, growth promoting neurotrophins (GDNF, BDNF & NT-3) and reduction in the inhibitory molecule (Nogo-A) after this combinatorial therapy. We obsrvered that a significant improvement in behavioral, electrophysiological and morphological parameters was due to an alteration in neurotrophin levels, reduction in activated microglia and increase in GAP-43 expression after the combinatorial therapy. We propose that implantation of IONPs embedded gelatin-genipin hydrogel system along with MF exposure modulated the microenvironment, making it conducive for neural repair and regeneration.","gelatin"

In this regard, hydrogels are attractive SC scaffolds as they can provide not only an adjustable physiologically native-like microenvironment but also an appropriate matrix for cell delivery, drug delivery, and other bioactive molecule delivery at the lesion site. This systematic review characterizes the widely used biomaterials including natural polymers; protein- and polysaccharide-based synthetic polymers; methacrylate- and polyethylene glycol-based, and self-assembling (SA) peptides. In addition, synthesis routes of hydrogels are investigated. This review is complemented by the discussion of the various techniques utilized for hydrogel scaffold designs with their in vitro and in vivo outcomes and clinical trials.

Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate or differentiate into other specific cell types. These cells represent potential treatments for SCIs. However, recent studies have shown that NSCs mainly differentiate into astrocytes, rather than neurons, in the microenvironment of an SCI. BMSCs have been reported to promote neuronal differentiation of NSCs and reduce the formation of astrocytes. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) provides superior mechanical properties and functional characteristics for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In this study, we proposed a functional scaffold developed by loading BMSCs and NSCs into 3D GelMA hydrogel. BMSCs and NSCs that were photo-encapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and demonstrated good proliferation in vitro. The NSCs differentiated more toward neurons and oligodendrocytes than toward astrocytes, a phenomenon more noticeable in low-modulus hydrogels. When functional hydrogel scaffolds, loaded with BMSCs and NSCs, were implanted into the hemisection site of the rat spinal cord, they could significantly promote motor function recovery and neuronal differentiation, and decrease glial scarring, fibrotic scarring, and inflammatory responses. The immense therapeutic potential of this system to promote axonal regeneration was thereby demonstrated. Taken together, loading of the GelMA scaffold with BMSCs and NSCs is a promising therapeutic strategy to trigger functional regeneration of the spinal cord.","gelatin"

In this study, to attenuate activated microglia/macrophage mediated-inflammation in the spinal cord of complete transection SCI mice, a combination of photo-crosslinked hydrogel transplantation and CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397) treatment was used to replace the prolonged, activated microglia/macrophages via cell depletion and repopulation. This combined treatment in SCI mice produced a significant reduction in CD68-positive reactive microglia/macrophages and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and a substantial increase in the number of Tuj1-positive neurons in the lesion area compared with single treatment methods. Moreover, most of the newborn Tuj1-positive neurons were confirmed to be generated from endogenous NSPCs using a genetic fate mapping mouse line (Nestin-CreERT2; LSL-tdTomato) that can label and trace NSPC marker-nestin expressing cells and their progenies.

A SCI model was established by surgery via a complete transection of the T10 vertebra of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Gelatin sponges were used to absorb NSCs labeled with the thymidine analog, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were transferred into the transected spinal cords. BYHWD was administered once a day by introgastric infusion. Motor functions of the hind limbs were evaluated using the 21-point locomotor rating scale developed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB). The fate of the transplanted NSCs under the various conditions was examined by double immunofluorescence staining, using markers for neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with BrdU. Ultrastructural changes of the SCI site following the various treatments were examined under a transmission electron microscope. The number of double positive cells for glial fibrillary acidic protein and BrdU in the BYHWD + NSC group was significantly decreased when compared with that in the NSC group (P<0.05). However, the number of cells that were labeled double positive for myelin basic protein and BrdU, as well as neuron specific enolase and BrdU, was greater in the BYHWD + NSC group when compared with the NSC group. Electron microscopy demonstrated that treatment with BYHWD combined with NSCs significantly alleviated demyelination. Results from the BBB motor function test exhibited a significant improvement in the BYHWD + NSC group when compared with the SCI, BYHWD and NSC only groups. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the traditional Chinese medicine formula, BYHWD, exerted an effect on the differentiation and migration of NSCs. Combining the administration of BYHWD with NSCs was shown to have a synergistic effect on the recovery of neurological function, mitigating the progress of demyelination or ameliorating the recovery of myelination.","gelatin"

Transplantation of neural progenitors is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, infusion of dissociated cells often suffers from low viability, uneven cell distribution, and poor in vivo engraftment that could be reinforced by a better cell delivery system. Here, we develop an injectable composite hydrogel system for use as a minimally invasive treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) using motor neurons (MNs) derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The composite hydrogel is based on a modified gelatin matrix integrated with shape-memory polymer fibers. The gelatin matrix creates a local microenvironment for cell assembly and also acts as a lubricant during injection through a fine catheter. Notably, shape-memory fiber scaffolds are able to recover to maintain the microstructures even after dramatic deformation from injection operation, providing the necessary support and guidance for motor neuron differentiation. We find that the composite hydrogel with an aligned fiber scaffold greatly improves the viability of ESCs and their differentiation toward MNs both in vitro and in vivo. When transplanted to SCI animals by injection, the ESC-loaded composite hydrogels are identified to significantly enhance tissue regeneration and motor function recovery in mice. With this proof-of-concept study, we believe that the injectable composite hydrogel system provides a promising solution for in vivo cell delivery with minimum invasiveness and can be readily extended to other stem-cell-based regenerative treatments.","gelatin"

CBD-HGF remained in the spinal cord for 7 days after a single administration, while unmodified HGF was barely seen at 1 day. When a gelatinfurfurylamine (FA) hydrogel was applied on damaged spinal cord as a scaffold, CBD-HGF was retained in gelatin-FA hydrogel for 7 days, whereas HGF had faded by 1 day. A single administration of CBD-HGF enhanced recovery from spinal cord compression injury compared with HGF, as determined by motor recovery, and electrophysiological and immunohistochemical analyses. CBD-HGF alone failed to improve recovery from a complete transection injury, however CBD-HGF combined with gelatin-FA hydrogel promoted endogenous repair and recovery more effectively than HGF with hydrogel. These results suggest that engineered CBD-HGF has superior therapeutic effects than naive HGF. CBD-HGF combined with hydrogel scaffold may be promising for the treatment of serious SCI.","gelatin"

In the present study, we tested a combinational therapy to improve on this situation. MSCs were loaded into three-dimensional gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold. After 7 days of induction with neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and retinoic acid (RA) in vitro, we observed a significant increase in TrkC mRNA transcription by Real-time PCR and this was confirmed by in situ hybridization. The expression of TrkC was also confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Differentiation potential of MSCs in vitro into neuron-like cells or oligodendrocyte-like cells was further demonstrated by using immunofluorescence staining. The pre-induced MSCs seeding in GS scaffolds were then grafted into the transected rat spinal cord. One day after grafting, Governor Vessel electro-acupuncture (GV-EA) treatment was applied to rats in the NR-MSCs + EA group. At 30 days after GV-EA treatment, it found that the grafted MSCs have better survival rate and neuron-like cell differentiation compared with those without GV-EA treatment. The sustained TrkC expression in the grafted MSCs as well as increased NT-3 content in the injury/graft site by GV-EA suggests that NT-3/TrkC signaling pathway may be involved in the promoting effect. This study demonstrates that GV-EA and pre-induction with NT-3 and RA together may promote the survival and differentiation of grafted MSCs in GS scaffold in rat SCI.","gelatin"

The results showed that after co-culturing with neurotropin-3 overexpressing Schwann cells in a gelatin sponge scaffold for 14 days, TrkC overexpressing MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells. In the latter, some cells appeared to make contacts with each other through synapse-like structures with trans-synaptic electrical activities.

Magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging showed that the canines receiving the MSC-derived neural network tissue exhibited robust nerve tract regeneration in the injury/graft site. Histological analysis showed that some of the MSC-derived neuron-like cells had survived in the injury/graft site up to 6.5 months. Implantation of MSC-derived neural network tissue significantly improved the microenvironment of the injury/graft site. It is noteworthy that a variable number of them had integrated with the regenerating corticospinal tract nerve fibers and 5-HT nerve fibers through formation of synapse-like contacts.

Murine spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 10 g) to the dura after a three-level T8-T10 laminectomy. The wet/dry weight ratio was used to reflect the percentage of water content of impaired spinal cord tissue at 48 hr after SCI. The mRNA levels of MMP-9 were determined using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein levels of TNF-alpha and MMP-9 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) at 24 hr after SCI. Gelatin zymography was used to determine MMP-9 activity of spinal cord tissue at 24 hr after SCI. Mice treated with SFN at 1 hr after SCI had lower expression and activity of MMP-9 compared to mice with SCI. The decrease of MMP-9 in mice treated with SFN was associated with decreased levels of spinal cord water content and TNF-alpha. In summary, suforaphane decreases MMP-9 and TNF-alpha expression and vascular permeability changes following spinal cord injury in mice.","gelatin"

In the present study, we evaluated the degradation profile of NNCs and LNCs, and observed that NNCs degraded too fast to implant. To delay the degradation and retain the nano-scale effect of NNCs, we used gelatin to wrap (2% w/v gelatin) or embed (8% w/v gelatin) NNCs and LNCs via vacuum infusion and chemical cross-linking with genipin. NNCs-wrapped maintained their original nano-fibrous microstructure, but NNCs-embedded presented a porous morphology without nanofibers appearing. Incorporation of gelatin did not change their compressive moduli, but increased the creep recovery ratios of LNCs and NNCs. In vitro degradation revealed that integrity was maintained and the mass loss was < 5% for NNCs-wrapped after 10 weeks, in comparison with 15% mass loss and collapsed structure of the pure NNCs after 4 weeks. Meanwhile, there were no obvious changes in the degradation of LNCs with modification. Nerve stem cells (NSCs) were then seeded onto the six NCs represented as: NNCs, NNCs-wrapped, NNCs-embedded, LNCs, LNCs-wrapped, and LNCs-embedded. Immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that gelatin coating enhanced the adhesion and proliferation of NSCs, and the NNCs-wrapped scaffold promoted the differentiation proportion of NSCs into neurons from 25.8% (on pure NNCs) to 53.4% after 14 days of seeding. On the other hand, only 14.3% of neurons were derived from the differentiation of the seeded NSCs on the NNCs-embedded. NNCs-wrapped would be a good choice for future studies in nerve injury repair in vivo due to its appropriate degradation rate, flexibility, and nano-scale effect.","gelatin"

This was aimed to generate a tissue-engineered neural scaffold and to investigate whether it could enhance myelination after a complete T10 spinal cord transection in adult rats. Indeed, many NT-3 overexpressing SCs (NT-3-SCs) in the GS scaffold assumed the formation of myelin. More strikingly, a higher incidence of NSCs overexpressing TrkC differentiating toward myelinating cells was induced by NT-3-SCs. By transmission electron microscopy, the myelin sheath showed distinct multilayered lamellae formed by the seeded cells. Eighth week after the scaffold was transplanted, some myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive processes were observed within the transplantation area. Remarkably, certain segments of myelin derived from NSC-derived myelinating cells and NT-3-SCs were found to ensheath axons.

Anisotropic ACH were prepared by ionotropic gel formation using Ba2+, Cu2+, Sr2+, or Zn2+ ions resulting in gels with average capillary diameters of 11, 13, 29, and 89 pm, respectively. Postnatal rat entorhinal cortex or spinal cord slice cultures were placed on top of 500 pm thick ACH. Seven days later axon growth and astroglial migration into the ACM were determined. Axon density within capillaries correlated positively with increasing capillary diameters, whereas longitudinally oriented axon outgrowth diminished with increasing capillary diameter. Axons growing into the hydrogels were always accompanied by astrocytes strongly suggesting that respective cells are required to mediate CNS axon elongation into ACH. Overall, midsize capillary diameter ACH appeared to be the best compromise between axon density and orientation.

The mechanical property of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel can be easily controlled and shared similar characteristics with nerve tissue, thus promoting cell survival and controlled cell differentiation. We propose the combination of a 3D gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with iPSC-derived NSCs (iNSCs) to promote regeneration after SCI. In vitro, the iNSCs photoencapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and differentiated well, especially in lower-moduli hydrogels. More robust neurite outgrowth and more neuronal differentiation were detected in the soft hydrogel group. To further evaluate the in vivo neuronal regeneration effect of the GelMA hydrogels, a mouse spinal cord transection model was generated. We found that GeIMA/iNSC implants significantly promoted functional recovery. Further histological analysis showed that the cavity areas were significantly reduced, and less collagen was deposited in the GelMA/iNSC group. Furthermore, the GelMA and iNSC combined transplantation decreased inflammation by reducing activated macrophages/microglia (CD68-positive cells). Additionally, GelMA/iNSC implantation showed striking therapeutic effects of inhibiting GFAP-positive cells and glial scar formation while simultaneously promoting axonal regeneration. Undoubtedly, use of this 3D hydrogel stem cell-loaded system is a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI repair.","gelatin"

Gelatin nanostructured lipid carriers (GNLs) had previously been used to encapsulate the basic fibroblast growth factor to enhance the functional recovery in hemiparkinsonian rats. In this research, we comparatively study the enhanced therapy between nerve growth factor (NGF) loaded GNLs (NGF-GNLs) and NGF only in spinal cord injury (SCI). The effects of NGF-GNLs and NGF only were tested by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, inclined plane test, and footprint analysis. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining were further performed to identify the expression of ER stress-related proteins, neuron-specific marker neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43). Correlated downstream signals Akt/GSK-3 beta and ERK1/2 were also analyzed with or without inhibitors. Results showed that NGF-GNLs, compared to NGF only, enhanced the neuroprotection effect in SCI rats. The ER stress-induced apoptosis response proteins CHOP, GRP78 and caspase-12 inhibited by NGF-GNL treatment were more obvious. Meanwhile, NGF-GNLs in the recovery of SCI are related to the inhibition of ER stress-induced cell death via the activation of downstream signals PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta and ERK1/2.","gelatin"

Although open fetal surgical repair of the MMC defect has been shown to result in improved outcomes, a less invasive approach applicable earlier in gestation than the current open surgical approach between 19 and 26 weeks of gestation is desirable for further improvement of neurological symptoms, as well as reduction of maternal and fetal risks. We previously reported the therapeutic potential of a scaffold-based tissue engineering approach in a fetal rat MMC model. The objective of this study was to confirm the long-term efficacy of this approach in the surgically created fetal sheep MMC model. Gelatin-based or gelatin/collagen hybrid sponges were prepared with and without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) incorporation. The defect was covered by a sponge and secured by a supporting sheet with adhesive at 100 days of gestation or the gelatin/collagen hybrid with bFGF was secured with adhesive without the sheet. Although sheets were found detached at term (140 days' gestation), both gelatin-based and gelatin/collagen hybrid sponges had integrated within the newly formed granulation tissue, resulting in complete coverage of the MMC defect. The release of bFGF from sponges resulted in enhanced formation of granulation tissue and epithelialization. There was also evidence of improved preservation of the spinal cord with less associated damage on histological analysis and reversal of hindbrain herniation. These experiments provide important proof-of-principle evidence of the efficacy of scaffold-based tissue engineered coverage for the prenatal treatment of MMC. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Neuronal xenogeneic cells from biopsies of adult nasal olfactory mucosa (NOM) of human origin, or spinal cords of human embryos, were cultured in two consecutive stages: stationary cultures in a viscous semi-solid gel (NVR-N-Gel) and in suspension on positively charged microcarriers (MCs). A tissue-engineered tubular scaffold, containing bundles of parallel nanofibers, was developed. Both the tube and the nanofibers were made of a biodegradable dextran sulphate-gelatin co-precipitate. The suturable scaffold anchored the implant at the site of injury and provided guidance for the regenerating axons. Implants of adult human NOM cells were implanted into eight rats, from which a 4 mm segment of the spinal cord had been completely removed. Another four rats whose spinal cords had also been transected were implanted with a composite implant of cultured human embryonic spinal cord cells. Eight other cord-transected rats served as a control group. Physiological and behavioral analysis, performed 3 months after implantation, revealed partial recovery of function in one or two limbs in three out of eight animals of the NOM implanted group and in all the four rats that were implanted with cultured human embryonic spinal cord cells. Animals of the control group remained completely paralyzed and did not show transmission of stimuli to the brain. The utilization of an innovative composite implant to bridge a gap resulting from the transection and removal of a 4 mm spinal cord segment shows promise, suggesting the feasibility of this approach for partial reconstruction of spinal cord lesions. Such an implant may serve as a vital bridging station in acute and chronic cases of paraplegia.","gelatin"

A better understanding of these mechanisms could lead to effective therapeutic strategies following spinal cord injury (SCI). We explored these mechanisms by examining molecular changes in postmortem human spinal cord tissue from cases with acute and chronic SCI. Complementary studies were conducted using the in vivo Fejota (TM) clip compression model of SCI in Fas-deficient B6.MRL-Fas-lpr (lpr) and wild-type (Wt) mice to test Fas-mediated apoptosis, inflammation, gliosis and axonal degeneration by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, gelatin zymography and ELISA with Mouse 32-plex cytokine/chemokine panel bead immunoassay. We report novel evidence that shows that Fas-mediated apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes occurred in the injury epicenter in all cases of acute and subacute SCI and not in chronic SCI or in control cases. We also found significantly reduced apoptosis, expression of GFAP, NF-kappa B, p-IKappaB and iba1, increased number of CD4 positive T cells and MMP2 expression and reduced neurological dysfunction in lpr mice when compared with Wt mice after SCI. We found dramatically reduced inflammation and cytokines and chemokine expression in B6.MRL-Fas-lpr mice compared to Wt mice after SCI. In conclusion, we report multiple lines of evidence that Fas/FasL activation plays a pivotal role in mediating apoptosis, the inflammatory response and neurodegeneration after SCI, providing a compelling rationale for therapeutically targeting Fas in human SCI.","gelatin"

We therefore tested if novel tissue engineering approaches could enable neural network repair that facilitates functional recovery after spinal cord transection (SCT). Rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), genetically engineered to overexpress TrkC, receptor of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), were pre-differentiated into cells carrying neuronal features via co-culture with NT-3 overproducing Schwann cells in 3-dimensional gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold for 14 days in vitro. Intra-GS formation of MSC assemblies emulating neural network (MSC-GS) were verified morphologically via electron microscopy (EM) and functionally by whole-cell patch clamp recording of spontaneous post-synaptic currents. The differentiated MSCs still partially maintained prototypic property with the expression of some mesodermal cytokines. MSC-GS or GS was then grafted acutely into a 2 mm-wide transection gap in the T9-T10 spinal cord segments of adult rats. Eight weeks later, hindlimb function of the MSC-GS-treated SO rats was significantly improved relative to controls receiving the GS or lesion only as indicated by BBB score. The MSC-GS transplantation also significantly recovered cortical motor evoked potential (CMEP). Histologically, MSC-derived neuron-like cells maintained their synapse-like structures in vivo; they additionally formed similar connections with host neurites (i.e., mostly serotonergic fibers plus a few corticospinal axons; validated by double-labeled immuno-EM). Moreover, motor cortex electrical stimulation triggered c-fos expression in the grafted and lumbar spinal cord cells of the treated rats only. Our data suggest that MSC-derived neuron-like cells resulting from NT-3-TrkC-induced differentiation can partially integrate into transected spinal cord and this strategy should be further investigated for reconstructing disrupted neural circuits.

Two important components for tissue engineering of the spinal cord include a suitable cell source and scaffold. In our study, we investigated induced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) directly reprogrammed into neural stem cells (iNSCs), as a cell source. Three-dimensional (3D) electrospun poly (lactide-co-glycolide)/polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanofiber scaffolds were used for iNSCs adhesion and growth. Cell growth, survival and proliferation on the scaffolds were investigated. Scanning electron microcopy (SEM) and nuclei staining were used to assess cell growth on the scaffolds. Scaffolds with iNSCs were then transplanted into transected rat spinal cords. Two or 8 weeks following transplantation, immunofluorescence was performed to determine iNSC survival and differentiation within the scaffolds. Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Scale. Results indicated that iNSCs showed similar morphological features with wild-type neural stem cells (wt-NSCs), and expressed a variety of neural stem cell marker genes. Furthermore, iNSCs were shown to survive, with the ability to self-renew and undergo neural differentiation into neurons and glial cells within the 3D scaffolds in vivo. The iNSC-seeded scaffolds restored the continuity of the spinal cord and reduced cavity formation. Additionally, iNSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to functional recovery of the spinal cord. Therefore, PLGA-PEG scaffolds seeded with iNSCs may serve as promising supporting transplants for repairing spinal cord injury (SCI).","gelatin"

Formation of the glial scar involves migration of astrocytes toward the lesion. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-9 and MMP-2, govern cell migration through their ability to degrade constituents of the extracellular matrix. Although MMP-9 is expressed in reactive astrocytes, its involvement in astrocyte migration and formation of a glial scar is unknown. Here we found that spinal cord injured, wild-type mice expressing MMPs developed a more severe glial scar and enhanced expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, indicative of a more inhibitory environment for axonal regeneration/plasticity, than MMP-9 null mice. To determine whether MMP-9 mediates astrocyte migration, we conducted a scratch wound assay using astrocytes cultured from MMP-9 null, MMP-2 null, and wild-type mice. Gelatin zymography confirmed the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in wild-type cultures. MMP-9 null astrocytes and wild-type astrocytes, treated with an MMP-9 inhibitor, exhibited impaired migration relative to untreated wild-type controls. MMP-9 null astrocytes showed abnormalities in the actin cytoskeletal organization and function but no detectable untoward effects on proliferation, cellular viability, or adhesion. Interestingly, MMP-2 null astrocytes showed increased migration, which could be attenuated in the presence of an MMP-9 inhibitor. Collectively, our studies provide explicit evidence that MMP-9 is integral to the formation of an inhibitory glial scar and cytoskeleton-mediated astrocyte migration. MMP-9 may thus be a promising therapeutic target to reduce glial scarring during wound healing after spinal cord injury.","gelatin"

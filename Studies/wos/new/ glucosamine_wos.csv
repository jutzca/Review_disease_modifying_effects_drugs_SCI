Thiamet-G (O-GlcNAcase inhibitor) could upregulate protein O-GlcNAcylation level to improve dyskinesia in models of neurodegenerative diseases without any obvious detrimental side-effects. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the effects of protein O-GlcNAcylation upregulation by Thiamet-G on the spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Methods-We randomly assigned 74 rats to three groups: sham-operated group (Sham) with no lesion (n = 22), injured control group (SCI+SS) with saline solution (n = 26), and Thiamet-G treated group (SCI+Thiamet-G) (n = 26). We assessed Locomotor behavior using the Basso, Beattice, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and evaluated histopathological alterations by morphometry and histochemistry. We also assessed potential inflammatory effects by microglia/macrophages immunohistochemistry, and potential apoptosis effects by caspase-3 western blot. Results-Thiamet-G treatment improved hindlimb motor functional recovery by inducing elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation, and mitigated the severity, reduced the lesion size and promoted the structural recovery of the injured spinal cord. Thiamet-G treatment also inhibited microglia/macrophages infiltration at the injury sites and the caspase-3 mediated apoptosis pathway. Discussion-We conclude that Thiamet-G induced elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation to ameliorate acute SCI, which could provide a potential novel therapeutic approach for SCI treatment.","glucosamine"

After spinal cord injury (SCI), excitotoxicity is considered to play a significant role in the processes of secondary tissue destruction in both grey and white matter of the spinal cord. In this study, we have tested the potential therapeutic effect of glucosamine-kynurenic acid, administered after experimental compression-induced SCI in the rat. Spinal application of glucosamine-kynurenic acid continually for 24 hr after experimental SCI resulted in improved motor function recovery, beginning from the first week of evaluation and continuing until the end of the study (4 weeks). After 4 weeks' survival, quantitative morphometric analysis of the spinal cord showed that glucosamine-kynurenic acid treatment was associated with improved tissue preservation at the lesion site. These findings indicate that spinal application of glucosaminekynurenic acid is neuroprotective and improves the outcome even when administered after spinal trauma. Our results suggest that the treatments initiated in early posttraumatic period can alleviate secondary injury and improve the final outcome after SCI.","glucosamine"

SCI models were established using adult female mice. After SCI, the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis proteins were examined in the mice at specific time points using immunohistochemistry and western blot. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that in spinal cord gray matter, Chop, Grp78, XBP1, Eif-2 alpha and Bad were specifically detected in the cytoplasm of the cell. Compare with the SCI group, there was little expression in normal group and sham group. The expression of ER stress-induced apoptosis proteins were significantly increased after spinal cord injury, and the absolute expression was higher than normal group (P < 0.05). Western-Blot results showed that compare with the SCI group, there were little expression of ER stress-induced apoptosis proteins in normal group and sham group. The expression of ER stress-induced apoptosis proteins were significantly increased after spinal cord injury, and the absolute expression was higher than normal group (P < 0.05). These results suggest that some ER stress-induced apoptosis proteins, such as Chop, Grp78, XBP1, Eif-2 alpha and Bad, were activated after spinal cord injury, but the precise regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In the future, understanding of the precise mechanism of ER stress-mediated apoptosis in SCI may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies.","glucose"

Binding and immunoprecipitation assays indicated that NLK binds to GRP78. Pretreatment to cultured neurons with a GRP78-neutralizing antibody suppressed NLK-induced axonal growth. Blocking cell surface GRP78 inhibited neuronal NLK-induced Akt activation. Treatment with an Akt inhibitor suppressed NLK-induced axonal growth. Continuous administration of NLK into the lateral ventricle of SCI mice increased axonal density in the injured region and restored motor function, which was not observed when NLK was simultaneously administered with a GRP78-neutralizing antibody. These results indicate that GRP78 regulates the NLK-induced axonal growth activity; NLK-GRP78 signaling promotes motor function recovery in SCI, presenting as a potential therapeutic target.","glucose"

After SCI, Western diet impaired sensorimotor and bladder recovery, increased microgliosis, exacerbated oligodendrocyte loss and reduced axon sprouting.

Here, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into acute and chronic treatment groups and sham groups with day-matched periods. The Basso, Beatte, and Bresnahan scores method were utilized to evaluate the changes in behaviors during the recovery of the animals, and the metabolic information was measured with the(1)H-observed/C-13-edited NMR method. Total metabolic concentrations in every region were almost similar in both treated groups. However, the metabolic kinetics in most regions in the acute group were significantly altered (P < .05), particularly in the cortical area, thalamus and medulla (P < .01). After long-term recovery, some metabolic kinetics were recovered, especially in the temporal cortex, occipital cortex, and medulla. The metabolic kinetic changes revealed the alteration of metabolism and neurotransmission in different brain regions after SCI, which present evidence for the alternation of brain glucose oxidation. Therefore, this shows the significant influence of SCI on cerebral function and neuroscience research. This study also provides the theoretical basis for clinical therapy after SCI, such as mitochondrial transplantation.","glucose"

Therapies using nerve growth factors to treat SCI mainly focused on reducing the area damaged by postinjury degeneration to promote functional recovery. In this report, we investigated the mechanism of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress-induced apoptosis and the protective action of fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) in vivo. Our results demonstrated that ER stress-induced apoptosis plays a significant role in injury of SCI model rats. FGF22 administration promoted recovery and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord lesions of model mice. The protective effect of FGF22 is related to decreased expression of CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78), caspase-12, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (Eif-2 alpha) and Bad which are ER stress-induced apoptosis response proteins. Moreover, FGF22 administration also increased the number of neurons and the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) which was related to axon regeneration. We also demonstrated that the protective effect of FGF22 effectively reduces neuronal apoptosis and promotes axonal regeneration. Our study first illustrated that the function of FGF22 is related to the inhibition of ER stress-induced cell death in SCI recovery via activation of downstream signals. This study also suggested a new tendency of FGF22 therapy development in central neural system injuries, which involved chronic ER stress-induced apoptosis.","glucose"

Left ventricular internal diameter during systole (LVIDs) was decreased in SCI females more than in SCI males. No significant differences in glucose metabolism were observed up to 20 weeks post-injury (PI).

The effects of insulin on cells within the central nervous system are varied, and can include both metabolic and non-metabolic functions. Emerging data suggests that insulin can improve neuronal survival or recovery after trauma or during neurodegenerative diseases. Further, data suggests a strong anti-inflammatory component of insulin, which may also play a role in both neurotrauma and neurodegeneration. As a result, administration of exogenous insulin, either via systemic or intranasal routes, is an increasing area of focus in research in neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disorders.

Recently, moderate microtubule stabilization by Taxol has been shown to efficiently promote neurite regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the potential for the clinical translation of Taxol in treating SCI is limited by its side effects and low ability to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). Self-assembled peptide hydrogels have shown potential as drug carriers for the local delivery of therapeutic agents. We therefore hypothesized that the localized delivery of Taxol by a self-assembled peptide scaffold would promote axonal regeneration by stabilizing microtubules during the treatment of SCI. In the present study, the mechanistic functions of the Taxol-releasing system were clarifiedin vitroandin vivousing immunofluorescence labeling, histology and neurobehavioral analyses. Based on the findings from thein vitrostudy, Taxol released from a biological functionalized SAP nanofiber scaffold (FGLmx/Taxol) remained active and promoted neurite extension. In this study, we used a weight-drop contusion model to induce SCI at T9. The local delivery of Taxol from FGLmx/Taxol significantly decreased glial scarring and increased the number of nerve fibers compared with the use of FGLmx and 5% glucose. Furthermore, animals administered FGLmx/Taxol exhibited neurite preservation, smaller cavity dimensions, and decreased inflammation and demyelination. Thus, the local delivery of Taxol from FGLmx/Taxol was effective at promoting recovery after SCI and has potential as a new therapeutic strategy for SCI.","glucose"

Sodium Tanshinone IIA silate (STS) is used for the treatment of coronary heart disease and improves microcirculation. Whether STS exhibits protective effects for SCI microcirculation is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects of STS on oxygen-glucose deprivation- (OGD-) induced injury of spinal cord endothelial cells (SCMECs)in vitroand to explore effects on BSCB and neurovascular protectionin vivo. SCMECs were treated with various concentrations of STS (1 mu M, 3 mu M, and 10 mu M) for 24 h with or without OGD-induction. Cell viability, tube formation, migration, and expression of Notch signaling pathway components were evaluated. Histopathological evaluation (H&E), Nissl staining, BSCB permeability, and the expression levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), CD31, NeuN, and Notch signaling pathway components were analyzed. STS was found to improve SCMEC functions and reduce inflammatory mediators after OGD. STS also relieved histopathological damage, increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), inhibited BSCB permeability, rescued microvessels, protected motor neuromas, and improved functional recovery in a SCI model. Moreover, we uncovered that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role during these processes. These results indicated that STS protects microcirculation in SCI, which may be used as a therapeutic strategy for SCI in the future.","glucose"

Astrocytes were obtained from rat spinal cord. Cells were subjected to reoxygenation after 5 h OGD.

The results showed that astrocytic swelling occurred with cell volume increasing after OGD/Reox and the severity was significantly attenuated by JSK. A strong increase of AQP4 protein expression was observed after OGD/Reox, reaching a peak at 1.5 h into reoxygenation. The increase in levels of AQP4 protein was significantly reduced by treatment with JSK. In addition, confocal microscopy analysis showed that the F-actin microfilament polymerization by JSK accounted for AQP4 downregulation in the plasma membrane.

Glucose uptake in middle-aged rats was decreased compared to young rats at baseline, followed by increased uptake 14 days post contusion SCI. qRT-PCR and protein analysis revealed an association between 14 day glucose uptake and 14 day post-injury inflammation.

Inconsistencies between gene and protein suggest an influence of age-related impairment of translation and/or protein degradation.

Optimal inhibition of autophagy was achieved with the concentration of edaravone 50 mu M. Neurons pretreated with 50 mu M edaravone and established OGD/R model were analyzed for autophagy levels. Results: At every OGD/R time point autophagy was lower in neurons pretreated with edaravone than in those not pretreated with the drug. The difference was statistically significant without OGD/R 12 h. Conclusions: Pretreatment with edaravone may reduce the level of autophagy in neurons subjected to OGD/R injury.","glucose"

Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is implicated in secondary injury following damage to the SC. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment can improve the recovery of motor function after SCI, but the effect of HBO on the ERS response is unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that HBO treatment protects against secondary SCI by inhibiting the ERS response via regulation of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) expression. Rats were randomly assigned to sham, SCI, and SCI + HBO groups and the extent of neuronal damage and neurological recovery were evaluated 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. GRP78 and JNK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical, western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses, while caspase-3 activation was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SCI resulted in an upregulation in GRP78 and JNK expression compared to sham-operated animals. HBO treatment increased GRP78 level, but decreased that of JNK and suppressed caspase-3 activation as well as neuronal damage relative to the SCI group. In addition, hind limb motor function was improved by HBO treatment. HBO treatment reduces SCI-induced neuronal death and promotes the recovery of neurological function recovery by inhibiting the ERS response via modulation of GRP78 and JNK expression levels.","glucose"

In the human study, multivariate logistical regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, reflecting average plasma glucose concentration over a 3 month period, at admission were a significant risk factor for poor functional recovery. Moreover, patients with chronic hyperglycemia (HbA1c >= 6.5%) had high concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-8) of cerebrospinal fluid after SCI. Consistent with patient findings, chronic hyperglycemia before SCI in rats was associated with increased inflammatory responses and oxygen-free radicals in the spinal cord and blood, thus resulting in poor functional recovery and histological outcomes. Tight glucose control before SCI decreased the harmful effects of hyperglycemia after SCI in both human and rat studies.

A primary function of CNS astrocytes is to support the survival and function of neurons. In response to injury, astrocytes take on a reactive phenotype, which alters their molecular functions. Reactive astrocytes have been reported to be both beneficial and harmful to the CNS recovery process subsequent to injury. Understanding the molecular processes and regulatory proteins that determine the extent to which an astrocyte hinders or supports neuronal survival is important within the context of CNS repair. One protein that plays a role in modulating cellular survival is transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Global deletion of TG2 results in beneficial outcomes subsequent to in vivo ischemic brain injury. Ex vivo studies have also implicated TG2 as a negative regulator of astrocyte viability subsequent to injury. In this study we show that knocking down TG2 in astrocytes significantly increases their ability to protect neurons from oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion injury. To begin to understand how deletion of TG2 in astrocytes improves their ability to protect neurons from injury, we performed transcriptome analysis of wild type and TG2(-/-) astrocytes. TG2 deletion resulted in alterations in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion and axon growth/guidance. In addition, the majority of genes that showed increases in the TG2(-/-) astrocytes had predicted cJun/AP-1 binding motifs in their promoters. Furthermore, phospho-cJun levels were robustly elevated in TG2(-/-) astrocytes, a finding which was consistent with the increase in expression of AP-1 responsive genes. These in vitro data were subsequently extended into an in vivo model to determine whether the absence of astrocytic TG2 improves outcomes after CNS injury. Our results show that, following a spinal cord injury, scar formation is significantly attenuated in mice with astrocyte-specific TG2 deletion compared to mice expressing normal TG2 levels. Taken together, these data indicate that TG2 plays a pivotal role in mediating reactive astrocyte properties following CNS injury. Further, the data suggest that limiting the AP-1 mediated pro-survival injury response may be a contributing factor to that the detrimental effects of astrocytic TG2.","glucose"

Thus, seeking for valid drugs that are beneficial to promoting axonal regrowth and elongation after SCI has gained wide attention. Metformin, a glucose-lowering agent, has been demonstrated to play roles in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the potential protective effect of metformin on nerve regeneration after SCI is still unclear. In this study, we found that the administration of metformin improved functional recovery after SCI through reducing neuronal cell apoptosis and repairing neurites by stabilizing microtubules via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002 partly reversed the therapeutic effects of metformin on SCI in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, metformin treatment weakened the excessive activation of oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 partially abolished its antioxidant effect. We also found that the Nrf2 transcription was partially reduced by LY294002 in vitro. Taken together, these results revealed that the role of metformin in nerve regeneration after SCI was probably related to stabilization of microtubules and inhibition of the excessive activation of Akt-mediated Nrf2/ARE pathway-regulated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our present study suggests that metformin administration may provide a potential therapy for SCI.","glucose"

The inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by the specific inhibitor LY294002 partially reversed the therapeutic effects of FGF10 both in vivo and in vitro.

Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats received moderate thoracic (T)-9 contusion SCI (or sham surgery). First, SCI disrupted diurnal rhythms in two metabolic behaviors: fecal production and food intake rhythms were ablated acutely. SCI also expedited whole-gut transit time. In parallel, acute SCI increased plasma glucose. Diurnal glucose storage-release cycles regulated by the liver were disrupted by SCI, which also increased liver glucose metabolism messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Further, SCI disrupted liver clock gene expression and suppressed inflammatory gene rhythms. Together, our novel data suggest that SCI disrupts typical metabolic and circadian function.

Knockdown of RCAN1 markedly facilitated the structural and functional recovery in the spinal cord, as illustrated by decrease of lesion volume and increase of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) and combined behavioral score (CBS) scores. Downregulation of RCAN1 suppressed the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and inhibited the increase of TUNEL-positive cell numbers and caspases 3 and 9 activities.

The present study was designed to elaborate on that research by examining several potential mechanisms for the seizure-associated difference observed in functional outcome. Anesthetized rats sustained unilateral AMC lesions followed by implantation of a stimulating electrode in the amygdala ipsilateral (Expt. 1) or contralateral (Expt. 2) to the lesion. Beginning 48 h after surgery, animals were kindled to evoke Stage 0 or Stage 1 seizure activity during the critical period. Kindling trials and afterdischarge (AD) were controlled to ascertain their role in functional outcome. Recovery from somatosensory deficits was assessed over a two-month period. The results revealed that (i) Stage 0 seizures did not impact recovery regardless of whether initiated ipsilateral or contralateral to the lesion, (ii) Stage 1 seizures prevented recovery only when initiated in the ipsilateral hemisphere during the post-lesion critical period, and (iii) the detrimental effect of Stage 1 seizures appears to be independent of the number of kindling trials provided and cumulative AD. Thus, to determine why Stage 1 seizures evoked in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion impeded recovery, a separate group of animals (Expt. 3) were kindled accordingly and processed for c-Fos and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) immunohistochemistry. It was hypothesized that Stage 1 seizures evoked in the injured hemisphere prevent recovery by blocking lesion-induced bFGF expression in structures shown to he important for recovery after cortex lesions (e.g., striatum).

Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score, spinal cord infarct, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to investigate SCI. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to examine the abundances of miR-30c and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) either in spinal cord or PC12 cells. Luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to probe the interaction between miR-30c and SIRT1. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were used to analyze SIRT1 protein expression. Our results showed that I/R increased miR-30c expression and induced SCI, revealed by decreasing BBB score, enhancing apoptosis, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression. However, miR-30c knockdown attenuated I/R-induced SCI in vivo. Moreover, depletion of miR-30c protected PC12 cells against OGD-caused apoptosis and inflammatory response. In addition, SIRT1 was limited by miR-30c, silencing of which reversed anti-miR-30c-mediated inhibitory effect on apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in PC12 cells after OGD treatment. Collectively, abrogation of miR-30c inhibited spinal cord ischemia reperfusion injury through targeting SIRT1, providing a promising biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic for SCI.","glucose"

Hyperglycemia impairs neural functional recovery after SCI resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines.

AKR1B1, one member of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, is involved in the energy metabolism of plasm glucose and ROS production. The role of AKR1B1 in cancer cell proliferation and invasion has been confirmed. Meanwhile, Akt, one pivotal transcription factor particularly, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and ROS-mediated secondary injury in the lesion site. In our study, we established an acute SCI rat model to identify the expression of AKR1B1 and its role in neural recovery processes. Western blotting revealed the expression of AKR1B1 protein was elevated after injury, peaked at 3 days and declined gradually to normal at 14 days. Similar results was illustrated in immunohistochemistry staining of white matter. Double immunofluorescence staining showed AKR1B1 was expressed in glial cells and its expression was significantly increased in proliferative astrocytes during the pathological processes. Further experiments showed AKR1B1 was co-located with Akt protein in GFAP positive cells and immunoprecipitated with Akt in injured spinal cord as well. In summary, the present study demonstrated AKR1B1 played a vital role in astrocytes proliferation through Akt pathway, associated with the metabolism of hyperglycemia induced by SCI.","glucose"

A cytokine antibody array was used to screen changes in inflammation at the site of SCI lesion. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the distribution of cytokines.

The objective of the present functional metabolomics study was to identify and define the dominant metabolic pathways targeted by dietary LC-O3PUFAs. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed rodent purified chows containing menhaden fish oil-derived LC-O3PUFAs for 8 weeks before being subjected to sham or spinal cord contusion surgeries. We show, through untargeted metabolomics, that dietary LC-O3PUFAs regulate important biochemical signatures associated with amino acid metabolism and free radical scavenging in both the injured and sham-operated spinal cord. Of particular significance, the spinal cord metabolome of animals fed with LC-O3PUFAs exhibited reduced glucose levels (-48 %) and polar uncharged/hydrophobic amino acids (less than -20 %) while showing significant increases in the levels of antioxidant/anti-inflammatory amino acids and peptides metabolites, including beta-alanine (+24 %), carnosine (+33 %), homocarnosine (+27 %), kynurenine (+88 %), when compared to animals receiving control diets (p < 0.05). Further, we found that dietary LC-O3PUFAs impacted the levels of neurotransmitters and the mitochondrial metabolism, as evidenced by significant increases in the levels of N-acetylglutamate (+43 %) and acetyl CoA levels (+27 %), respectively. Interestingly, this dietary intervention resulted in a global correction of the pro-oxidant metabolic profile that characterized the SCI-mediated sensorimotor dysfunction. In summary, the significant benefits of metabolic homeostasis and increased antioxidant defenses unlock important neurorestorative pathways of dietary LC-O3PUFAs against SCI.","glucose"

We evaluated BSCB status using the Evans Blue dye extravasation test and measurement of tight junction (TJ) protein levels; we also assessed functional locomotor recovery. We detected autophagy-associated proteins in vivo and in vitro using both Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found that, in a rat model of SCI, LiCl attenuated the elevation in BSCB permeability, improved locomotor recovery, and inhibited the degradation of TJ proteins including occludin and claudin-5. LiCl significantly induced the extent of autophagic flux after SCI by increasing LC3-II and ATG-5 levels, and abolishing p62 accumulation. In addition, a combination of LiCl and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine not only partially eliminated the BSCB-protective effect of LiCl, but also exacerbated TJ protein degradation both in vivo and in vitro.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a class of intracellular calcium channels in various excitable tissues such as muscles and nervous tissues. The current study was designed to investigate the possible role of RyR2 upregulation in SCI and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms. Methods: Rats were injected with LVshRNAi- RyR2 and then exposed to spinal cord contusion injury. Results: The results showed that knockdown of RyR2 significantly promoted the recovery of structural and functional injury in spinal cord, as evidenced by reduction of lesion volume and increase of Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) and combined behavioral score (CBS) scores. Knockdown of RyR2 inhibited the increase of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. Moreover, downregulation of RyR2 increased oxygen consumption rate and decreased the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and ATF6, indicating the improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress after SCI. Furthermore, silence of RyR2 reduced oxidative stress, as reflected by decrease of TBARS and GSSG content and increase of GSH level. The expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), NOX4 and p66(shc) were increased in SCI rats. Knockdown of RyR2 significantly decreased NOX2 expression, but had no evident effect on NOX4 and p66(shc) expression. These results indicated NOX2 may be involved in RyR2-induced ROS generation which mediated contusion-induced spinal cord injury.

After treatment with JNK and p38 inhibitors, abnormally necroptotic cell death caused by GIT1 knockdown could be partially rescued, with the recovery of neuronal viability, which was still poorer than that in control neurons. Meanwhile, overactivation of JNK/p38 after GIT1 depletion was concomitant with excessive activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) that could be abolished by ASK1 silencing in HEK293T cells. Finally, GIT1 could disrupt the oligomerization of ASK1 via interaction between the synaptic localization domain that contains the coiled-coil (CC)-2 domain of GIT1 and the C-terminal CC domain of ASK1. It suppressed the autophosphorylation of ASK1 and led to decreasing activity of the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway.

It is now appreciated that the heterogeneity of functions adopted by these cells dictates neuropathophysiology. Research efforts to characterize the range of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes and functions adopted by microglia and macrophages are fueled by the potential for inflammatory cells to both exacerbate neurodegeneration and promote repair/disease resolution. The stimulation-based, M1/M2 classification system has emerged over the last decade as a common language to discuss macrophage and microglia heterogeneity across different fields. However, discontinuities between phenotypic markers and function create potential hurdles for the utility of the M1/M2 system in the development of effective immunomodulatory therapeutics for neuroinflammation. A framework to approach macrophage and microglia heterogeneity from a function-based phenotypic approach comes from rapidly emerging evidence that metabolic processes regulate immune cell activation. This concept of immunometabolism, however, is only beginning to unfold in the study of neurodegeneration and has yet to receive much focus in the context of neurotrauma. In this review, we first discuss the current views of macrophage and microglia heterogeneity and limitations of the M1/M2 classification system for neuropathological studies. We then review and discuss the current literature supporting metabolism as a regulator of microglia function in vitro. Lastly, we evaluate the evidence that metabolism regulates microglia and macrophage phenotype in vivo in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI).","glucose"

In the light of the low-risk implementation of prophylactic EODF, the clinical translation as a treatment prior to elective subacute or chronic interventions is attractive. There are numerous secondary complications after human SCI, including a 13- to 25-year reduction in lifespan.

Compared to other human stem cells, iPSC-NPCs were superior at promoting neuronal survival and outgrowth, and mitigating astrogliosis. Using comparative whole-genome microarrays and cytokine neutralization, we identified a neurorestorative secretome from iPSC-NPCs, and neutralizing enriched cytokines abolished neuroprotective effects in co-cultures. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates a relatively safe, yet effective epidural route for delivering human iPSC-NPCs, which acts predominately through discrete paracrine effects to promote functional recovery after stroke.","glucose"

Recent studies have shown that miR-451 regulates downstream molecules including AMPK/CAB39/MARK and mTOR to determine the balance between rapid proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Surgical removal of the main tumor is inevitably followed by recurrence of the tumor due to inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells in normal brain tissue. In order to address this complex process of cell proliferation and invasion and its response to conventional treatment, we propose a mathematical model that analyzes the intracellular dynamics of the miR-451-AMPK- mTOR-cell cycle signaling pathway within a cell. The model identifies a key mechanism underlying the molecular switches between proliferative phase and migratory phase in response to metabolic stress in response to fluctuating glucose levels. We show how up- or down-regulation of components in these pathways affects the key cellular decision to infiltrate or proliferate in a complex microenvironment in the absence and presence of time delays and stochastic noise. Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, contribute to the physical structure of the local brain microenvironment but also induce or inhibit glioma invasion by regulating the dynamics of the CSPG receptor LAR as well as the spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia. Using a multi-scale mathematical model, we investigate a CSPG-induced switch between invasive and non-invasive tumors through the coordination of ECM-cell adhesion and dynamic changes in stromal cells. We show that the CSPG-rich microenvironment is associated with non-invasive tumor lesions through LAR-CSGAG binding while the absence of glycosylated CSPGs induce the critical glioma invasion. We illustrate how high molecular weight CSPGs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion, leading to encapsulation of non-invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion. These different CSPG conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia. The complex distribution of CSPGs in the tumor microenvironment can determine the nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells, which suggests the need for careful therapeutic strategies.","glucose"

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) are ideal transplantable cells which have been shown to modulate the injury cascade of SCI mostly through paracrine effects. The present study investigates whether systemic administration of conditioned medium from MSCs (MSCcm) has the potential to be efficacious as an alternative to cell-based therapy for SCI. In neuron-glial cultures, MSC coculture effectively promoted neuronal connection and reduced oxygen glucose deprivation-induced cell damage. The protection was elicited even if neuron-glial culture was used to expose MSCcm, suggesting the effects possibly from released fractions of MSC. In vivo, intravenous administration of MSCcm to SCI rats significantly improved behavioral recovery from spinal cord injury, and there were increased densities of axons in the lesion site of MSCcm-treated rats compared to SCI rats. At early days postinjury, MSCcm treatment upregulated the protein levels of Olig 2 and HSP70 and also increased autophage-related proteins in the injured spinal cords. Together, these findings suggest that MSCcm treatment promotes spinal cord repair and functional recovery, possibly via activation of autophagy and enhancement of survival-related proteins.","glucose"

Although downstream targets of AMPK are widely characterized, the physiological factors governing isoform expression of this protein kinase are largely unknown. Nerve/contractile activity has a major impact on the metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscle, therefore likely to influence AMPK isoform expression. Spinal cord injury represents an extreme form of physical inactivity, with concomitant changes in skeletal muscle metabolism. We assessed the influence of longstanding and recent spinal cord injury on protein abundance of AMPK isoforms in human skeletal muscle. We also determined muscle fiber type as a marker of glycolytic or oxidative metabolism. In subjects with longstanding complete injury, protein abundance of the AMPK gamma 3 subunit, as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) IIa and IIx, were increased, whereas abundance of the AMPK gamma 1 subunit and MHC I were decreased. Similarly, abundance of AMPK gamma 3 and MHC IIa proteins were increased, whereas AMPK alpha 2, -beta 1, and -gamma 1 subunits and MHC I abundance was decreased during the first year following injury, reflecting a more glycolytic phenotype of the skeletal muscle. However, in incomplete cervical lesions, partial recovery of muscle function attenuated the changes in the isoform profile of AMPK and MHC. Furthermore, exercise training (electrically stimulated leg cycling) partly normalized mRNA expression of AMPK isoforms. Thus, physical activity affects the relative expression of AMPK isoforms. In conclusion, skeletal muscle abundance of AMPK isoforms is related to physical activity and/or muscle fiber type. Thus, physical/neuromuscular activity is an important determinant of isoform abundance of AMPK and MCH. This further underscores the need for physical activity as part of a treatment regimen after spinal cord injury to maintain skeletal muscle metabolism.","glucose"

Forty enzymes regulated these 15 metabolites in the metabolic network. We also found that 16 metabolites regulated by 130 enzymes in the metabolic network impacted neurobehavioral recovery.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of sevoflurane postconditioning on astrogliosis and glial scar formation in ischemic stroke model both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that 2.5% of sevoflurane postconditioning could significantly reduce infarction volume and improve neurologic deficits.

Consistent with the in vivo data, in the oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/Re) model, sevoflurane postconditioning could protect astrocyte against OGD/Re-induced injury, decrease the expression of GFAP, neurocan and phosphacan. Further studies demonstrated that sevoflurane postconditioning could down-regulate the expression of Lamp1 and active cathepsin B, and block I/R or OGD/Re-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into cytoplasm. In order to confirm whether inhibition of cathepsin B could attenuate the formation of glial scar, we used cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me as a positive control.

MMP-3 was produced and secreted in bEnd.3 cells, a mouse brain-derived endothelial cell line, by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/RO). OGD/RO-induced MMP-3 expression and activity was also significantly inhibited by ghrelin, which was dependent on the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a.

We also found that microglial activation after SCI was attenuated in MMP-3 knockout (KO) mice compared with wild type (WT) mice. Both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) production were more inhibited in MMP-3 KO than WT mice at 5 d after injury. When WT mice were treated with Mmp-3 siRNA after injury, MMP-3 activity, microglial activation, p38MAPK activation and proNGF expression were significantly inhibited. Ghrelin treatment also significantly inhibited MMP-3 expression and activation after SCI, which was dependent on GHS-R1a. Finally, RhoA activation and oligodendrocyte cell death after injury were attenuated by Mmp-3 siRNA or ghrelin treatment compared with vehicle control. Thus, our study indicates that MMP-3 produced in blood vessel endothelial cells after SCI serves as an endogenous molecule for microglial activation followed by p38MAPK activation and proNGF production, and further indicates that the protective effect of ghrelin on oligodendrocytes cell death may be at least partly mediated by the inhibition of MMP-3-induced microglial activation after SCI.

This study was designed to investigate whether bFGF is beneficial for the maintenance of junction proteins and the integrity of the BSCB to identify the relations with caveolin-1 regulation. We examined the integrity of the BSCB with Evans blue dye and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran extravasation, measured the junction proteins and matrix metalloproteinases, and evaluated the locomotor function recovery. Our data indicated that bFGF treatment improved the recovery of BSCB and functional locomotion in contusive SCI model rats, reduced the expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, and increased the expressions of caveolin-1 and junction proteins, including occludin, claudin-5, p120-catenin, and beta-catenin. In the brain, in microvascular endothelial cells, bFGF treatment increased the levels of junction proteins, caveolin-1 small interfering RNA abolished the protective effect of bFGF under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions, and the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and co-localization with caveolin-1 decreased significantly, which could not be reversed by bFGF treatment.

After OGD incubation, OLG cultures were divided into the following groups: 1) OGD alone, 2) OLG cocultured with BMSCs, 3) treatment with the phosphoinostide 3-kinase (PI3k) inhibitor LY294002, 4) LY294002-treated OLGs with BMSC cocultured, and 5) anti-p75 anti body-treated OLGs. After an additional 3 hr of reoxygenation incubation, OLG viability and apoptosis were measured. The mRNA expression in the BMSCs and OLGs was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), p75, and caspase 3 protein expressions in OLGs were measured by Western blot. Our results suggest that BMSCs produce growth factors, activate the Akt pathway, and increase the survival of OLGs. BMSCs also reduce p75 and caspase 3 expressions in the OGD-OLGs, which leads to decreased OLG apoptosis. BMSCs participate in OLG protection that may occur with promoting growth factors/PI3K/Akt and inhibiting the p75/caspase pathways.

Previously, it was reported that Nogo-A extracellular peptide residues 1-40 (NEP1-40), a competitive antagonist of Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1), has the ability to promote axonal regrowth and functional recovery after CNS injury. However, delivery of the therapeutic proteins into the brain parenchyma is limited due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We first generated a biologically active NEP1-40 fusion protein containing the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the transactivator of transcription (TAT), TAT-NEP1-40, which crosses the BBB in vivo after systemic delivery. The TAT-NEP1-40 can protect PC12 cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and promote neurite outgrowth when added exogenously to culture medium.

Cell transplantation in general offers the potential to replace central nervous system (CNS) cell types, achieve remyelination, deliver missing gene products, promote and guide axonal growth, modulate the host immune response, deliver neuroprotective factors, and provide a cellular substrate for bridging the lesion site, amongst other possible benefits. A host of cell types that differ in their developmental stage, CNS region and species of derivation, as well as in their phenotypic potential, have been tested in a variety of SCI animal models. Historically in the SCI field, most pre-clinical NSC and NPC transplantation studies have focused on neuronal and oligodendrocyte replacement. However, much less attention has been geared towards targeting astroglial dysfunction in the inured spinal cord, despite the integral roles played by astrocytes in both normal CNS function and in the diseased nervous system. Despite the relative lack of studies, cell transplantation-based targeting of astrocytes dates back to some of the earliest transplant studies in SCI animal models. In this review, we will describe the history of work involving cell transplantation for targeting astrocytes in models of SCI. We will also touch on the current state of affairs in the field, as well as on important future directions as we move forward in trying to develop this approach into a viable strategy for SCI patients.

It has been demonstrated that nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts a pivotal role in the regulation of neuronal growth and the promotion of DPN recovery. However, the exact molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent studies have indicated that as a novel therapeutic target, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress participates in the onset and progression of DPN. In the present study, it has been demonstrated that NGF prevents the sciatic nerve from degeneration and demyelination in DPN rats. Thus, RSC 96 cells, which retain the characteristic features of Schwann cells (SCs), were cultured in medium containing 30 mM glucose (high glucose, HG) to mimic SCs in DPN mice. The 50-ng/ml dose of NGF was identified to be the optimal concentration for treating an excessive ER stress level under HG conditions for 24 h. We found that NGF treatment significantly inhibits HG-induced ER stress and subsequently suppresses ER-related apoptosis. Further, NGF administration also activates the upstream signaling pathway of ER stress, PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta signaling and ERK1/2 signaling. Co-treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly reverses the protective role of NGF on HG-induced excessive ER stress and subsequent apoptosis. These observations suggest that the neuroprotective role of NGF in DPN is mediated by the inhibition of excessive ER stress via the activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.","glucose"

Induction of self-renewal and proliferation of endogenous regenerative machinery with noninvasive and nontoxic therapies could constitute a real hope and an alternative to cell transplantation for spinal cord injury patients. We previously showed that FM19G11 promotes differentiation of adult spinal cord-derived ependymal stem cells under hypoxia. Interestingly, FM19G11 induces self-renewal of these ependymal stem cells grown under normoxia. The analysis of the mechanism of action revealed an early increment of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 and 2 with an early drop of ATP, followed by a subsequent compensatory recovery with activated mitochondrial metabolism and the induction of glucose uptake by upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-4. Here we show that phosphorylation of AKT and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is involved in FM19G11-dependent activation of GLUT-4, glucose influx, and consequently in stem cell self-renewal. Small interfering RNA of uncoupling protein 1/2, GLUT-4 and pharmacological inhibitors of AKT, mTOR and AMPK signaling blocked the FM19G11-dependent induction of the self-renewal-related markers Sox2, Oct4, and Notch1. Importantly, FM19G11-treated animals showed accelerated locomotor recovery. In vivo intrathecal sustained administration of FM19G11 in rats after spinal cord injury showed more neurofilament TUJ1-positive fibers crossing the injured area surrounded by an increase of neural precursor Vimentin-positive cells. Overall, FM19G11 exerts an important influence on the self-renewal of ependymal stem progenitor cells with a plausible neuroprotective role, providing functional benefits for spinal cord injury treatment.

The results indicate that glucose concentration was the more important factor in sustaining cell growth and viability. To evaluate metabolic state during three-dimensional culture, MSCs were cultured for one week using two different medium compositions and two different concentrations of collagen gel matrix. The medium compositions only varied in glucose concentration. The results indicate that glucose and extracellular matrix were significant factors in the metabolic response of the cells.

Prior study had shown that levels of FGFs significantly increase following ischemic injury, reflecting a physiological protection mechanism. However, few reports demonstrated the efficacy of applying aFGF in cerebral ischemia. A recent report showed that the intranasal aFGF treatment improved neurological functional recovery; however, it did not significantly reduce the lesion size in ischemic rats. The present study examines the neuroprotective effect of aFGF on cortical neuron-glial cultures under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell damage and investigates whether epidural application of slow-released aFGF could improve benefit on ischemic stroke injury in conscious rats. We used a topical application of aFGF mixed in fibrin glue, a slow-release carrier, over the peri-ischemic cortex and examined such treatment on cerebral infarction and behavioral impairments of rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Results demonstrate that aFGF effectively protected cortical neuron-glial cultures from OGD-induced neuronal damage. Neurite extension from cortical neurons was significantly enhanced by aFGF, mediated through activation of AKT and ERK. In addition, topical application of fibrin glue-mixed aFGF dose-dependently reduced ischemia-induced brain infarction and improved functional restoration in ischemic stroke rats. Slow-released aFGF not only protected hippocampal and cortical cell loss but reduced microglial infiltration in FCI rats. Our results suggest that aFGF mixed in fibrin glue could prolong the protective/regenerative efficacy of aFGF to the damaged brain tissue and thus improve the functional restorative effect of aFGF.

Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: iPSC treatment, ESC treatment, and the control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection. After neurologic function tests and baseline F-18-FDG small-animal PET had been performed, 1.0 x 106 suspended iPSCs or ESCs were injected stereotactically into the left lateral ventricle. The treatment response was evaluated weekly by F-18-FDG PET scans and neurologic function tests. Histologic analyses and autoradiographic imaging were performed 4 wk after stem cell transplantation. Results: Compared with the PBS injection group, higher F-18-FDG accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction was observed in both the iPSC and the ESC treatment groups during the 4-wk period (P < 0.05). F-18-FDG accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction increased steadily over time in the iPSC treatment group. At 1 and 2 wk after stem cell transplantation, significant recovery of glucose metabolism was found in the ESC treatment group (P < 0.05) and then decreased gradually. The neurologic score in both stem cell-treated groups was significantly lower than that in the PBS group, indicating functional improvement. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that transplanted stem cells survived and migrated close to the ischemic region, and most of the stem cells expressed protein markers for cells of interest.

Sixteen weeks after SCI, body weights of injured female rats stabilized and were significantly lower than surgical control animals. At the same time point, SCI rats had a significantly lower whole body fat: lean tissue mass ratio than controls, as measured indirectly by NMR. Despite lower body weight and fat mass, the cumulative consumption of standard laboratory chow ( 4.0 kcal/ g) and mean energy intake ( kcal center dot day(-1) center dot 100 g body wt(-1)) of chronic SCI rats was significantly more than controls. Glucose tolerance tests indicated a significant enhancement in glucose handling in 16-wk SCI rats, which were coupled with lower serum insulin levels. The post mortem weight of gonadal and retroperitoneal fat pads was significantly reduced after SCI and IBAT displayed significantly lower real-time PCR expression of UCP1 mRNA. The reduced fat mass and IBAT UCP1 mRNA expression are contraindicative of the cumulative caloric intake by the SCI rats. The prolonged postinjury loss of body weight, including fat mass, is not due to hypophagia but possibly to permanent changes in gastrointestinal transit and absorption, as well as whole body homeostatic mechanisms.","glucose"

Expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cell proliferation-related molecules in vitro and in vivo were evaluated by immunostaining and western blot analysis. Neuronal apoptosis after MCAO was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method.

Astrocytes became activated in the cultured astrocytes exposure to OGD/R and in the rat brain after MCAO, accompanied with phosphorylation of EGFR. EGFR blockade significantly decreased expression of p-EGFR, inhibited cell cycle progression of astrocytes, and reduced reactive astrogliosis in vitro and in vivo. EGFR inhibition also reduced infarct volumes and improved neurologic scores of rats after MCAO.

Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling, can exert neuroprotective effects in several CNS diseases. However, its role in the process of reactive astrogliosis including cell proliferation, migration and cytokine production after cerebral ischemia still remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of mTOR blockade in cultured astrocytes exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), a wildly used cellular ischemia model which mimics ideally cerebral ischemia model in vivo. We found that astrocytes became activated after OGD/R, characterized by change of astrocytic morphology, upregulation of GFAP expression, the increase number of Edu positive cells, and accompanied with phosphorylation of mTOR protein and its substrate S6K1. Rapamycin significantly inhibited mTOR signal pathway, suppressed proliferation of astrocytes via modulation of cell cycle progression. Moreover, rapamycin attenuated astrocytic migration and mitigated production of inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and iNOS induced by astrocytes exposed to OGD/R. Taken together, our findings indicated that mTOR blockade by rapamycin attenuates astrocyte migration, proliferation and production of inflammation mediators.

Male Wistar rats (N = 147) were fasted for 16 h and had the left jugular vein cannulated followed by laminectomy or laminectomy + complete SCT between T-4 and T-5 vertebrae. The next day, a test meal (1.5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0.5 mg/ml in 5% glucose) was administered by gavage feeding and 10 min later cervical dislocation was performed. Dye recovery in the stomach, and proximal, mid and distal small intestine was determined by spectrophotometry. SCT inhibited GE and GI transit since it increased gastric recovery by 71.3% and decreased mid small intestine recovery by 100% (P < 0.05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy + section of the splanchnic nerves, i.v. hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) prevented the development of the SCT effect on GE and GI transit. Pretreatment with i.v. naloxone (3, mg/kg), L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was ineffective. Bilateral adrenalectomy or guanethidine (10 mg/kg) increased the magnitude of the GE inhibition, while i.v. prazosin (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the magnitude but did not abolish the GE inhibition. In summary, the inhibition of GI motility observed 1 day after thoracic SCT in awake rats seems to involve vagal and possibly splanchnic pathways. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we examined if EODF initiated prior to, or after, a T10 thoracic contusion injury would similarly lead to enhanced functional recovery compared to ad libitum feeding. Additionally, we tested if a group fed every day (pair-fed), but with the same degree of restriction as the EODF animals (similar to 25% calorie restricted), would also promote functional recovery, to examine if EODF's effect is due to overall calorie restriction, or is specific to alternating sequences of 24-h fasts and ad libitum eating periods. Behaviorally, both pre- and post-EODF groups exhibited better functional recovery in the regularity indexed BBB ambulatory assessment, along with several parameters of their walking pattern measured with the CatWalk device, compared to both the ad-libitium-fed group as well as the pair-fed group. Several histological parameters (intensity and symmetry of serotonin immunostaining caudal to the injury and gray matter sparing) correlated with functional outcome; however, no group differences were observed. Thus besides the beneficial effects of EODF after a partial cervical SCI, we now report that alternating periods of fasting (but not pair-fed) also promotes improved hindlimb locomotion after thoracic spinal cord contusion, demonstrating its robust effect in two different injury models.","glucose"

Synthetic PPAR gamma agonists (e.g. thiazolidinediones) are used to treat Type II diabetes and have the potential to limit the risk of developing brain injuries such as stroke by mitigating the influence of comorbidities. If brain injury develops, PPAR gamma serves as a master gatekeeper of cytoprotective stress responses, improving the chances of cellular survival and recovery of homeostatic equilibrium. In the acute injury phase, PPAR gamma directly restricts tissue damage by inhibiting the NFKI3 pathway to mitigate inflammation and stimulating the Nrf2/ARE axis to neutralize oxidative stress. During the chronic phase of acute brain injuries, PPAR gamma activation in injured cells culminates in the repair of gray and white matter, preservation of the blood brain barrier, reconstruction of the neurovascular unit, resolution of inflammation, and long-term functional recovery. Thus, PPAR gamma lies at the apex of cell fate decisions and exerts profound effects on the chronic progression of acute injury conditions. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of PPAR gamma in stroke and brain trauma and highlight the novel role of PPAR gamma in long-term tissue repair. We describe its structure and function and identify the genes that it targets. PPAR gamma regulation of inflammation, metabolism, cell fate (proliferation/differentiation/maturation/survival), and many other processes also has relevance to other neurological diseases. Therefore, PPAR gamma is an attractive target for therapies against a number of progressive neurological disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","glucose"

Starting 4 hours following C5 hemi-contusion injury animals were fed either a standard carbohydrate based diet or a KD formulation with lipid to carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 3: 1. The forelimb functional recovery was evaluated for 14 weeks, followed by quantitative histopathology. Post-injury 3: 1 KD treatment resulted in increased usage and range of motion of the affected forepaw. Furthermore, KD improved pellet retrieval with recovery of wrist and digit movements. Importantly, after returning to a standard diet after 12 weeks of KD treatment, the improved forelimb function remained stable. Histologically, the spinal cords of KD treated animals displayed smaller lesion areas and more grey matter sparing. In addition, KD treatment increased the number of glucose transporter-1 positive blood vessels in the lesion penumbra and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) expression. Pharmacological inhibition of MCTs with 4-CIN (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate) prevented the KD-induced neuroprotection after SCI, In conclusion, post-injury KD effectively promotes functional recovery and is neuroprotective after cervical SCI. These beneficial effects require the function of monocarboxylate transporters responsible for ketone uptake and link the observed neuroprotection directly to the function of ketones, which are known to exert neuroprotection by multiple mechanisms.

Light and electron microscopic analysis showed that increasing periods of oxygen/glucose deprivation (up to 1 h) caused, after a 90-min recovery period, the appearance of increasing numbers of swollen axons whose ultrastructure indicated that they were irreversibly damaged. This conclusion was supported by experiments showing that the damage persisted after a longer recovery period (3 h). To quantify the axonal pathology, an automated morphometric method, based on measurement of the density of swollen axons, was developed. Omission of Ca(2+) from the incubation solution during 1 h of oxygen/glucose deprivation land for 15 min either side) completely prevented the axonopathy (assessed following 90 min recovery). Omission of Na(+) was also effective, though less so (70% protection). The classical Na(+) channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (1 mu M), provided 92% protection. In view of this evidence implicating Na(+) channels in the pathogenesis of the axonal damage, the effects of three different Na(+) channel inhibitors, with known neuroprotective properties towards gray matter in in vivo models of cerebral ischaemia, were tested. The compounds used were lamotrigine and the structurally-related molecules, BW619C89 and BW1003C87. All three compounds protected the axons to varying degrees, the maximal efficacies (observed at 30 to 100 mu M) being in the order: BW619C89 (>95% protection) > BW1003C87 (70%)> lamotrigine (50%). At a concentration affording near complete protection (100 mu M), BW619C89 had no significant effect on the optic nerve compound action potential. Experiments in which BW619C89 was added at different times indicated that its effects were exerted during two distinct phases, one (accounting for about 50% protection) was during the early stage of oxygen/glucose deprivation itself and the other (also about 50%) during the first 15 min of recovery in normal incubation solution.","glucose"

Accordingly, we examined the role of group I mGluRs, which are linked to phospholipase C, in mediating SCI using an in vitro model. A dorsal column segment was isolated from the spinal cord of adult rats, maintained in vitro, and injured by compression for 15 sec with a clip having a 2g closing force. Under control conditions after SCI, the compound action potential (CAP) amplitude was reduced to 69.1 +/- 5.4% of baseline.

The group I/II agonist trans-ACPD and selective group I agonist DHPG exacerbated the posttraumatic reduction of CAP amplitude. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 improved recovery of CAP amplitude after traumatic spinal cord axonal injury. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of mGluR1 alpha-immunopositive astrocytes and the absence of mGluR5 in spinal cord white matter. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of group I mGluR receptors after SCI exacerbates posttraumatic axonal injury through a phospholipase C dependent mechanism, The presence of mGluR1 alpha labeling on astrocytes suggests a role for these cells in the pathophysiology of SCI. Additional studies in vivo, are required to further clarify the role of mGluRs in acute traumatic SCI.","glucose"

Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), plienytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p < 0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment.

In agreement, EODF preserved neuronal integrity, dramatically reduced lesion volume by > 50%, and increased Sprouting of corticospinal axons. As expected, blood beta-hydfoxybutyrate levels, a ketone known to be neuroprotective, were increased by 2-3 fold on the fasting days.

After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with an infinite horizon impactor in the mouse, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and further administered once a day for indicated time points. Fluoxetine treatment significantly inhibited messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, 9 and 12 after spinal cord injury. By zymography and fluorimetric enzyme activity assay, fluoxetine also significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease 2 and matrix metalloprotease 9 activities after injury. In addition, fluoxetine inhibited nuclear factor kappa B-dependent matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in bEnd.3, a brain endothelial cell line, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Fluoxetine also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as zona occludens 1 and occludin after injury in vivo as well as in bEnd.3 cultures. By immunofluorescence staining, fluoxetine prevented the breakdown of the tight junction integrity in endothelial cells of blood vessel after injury. Furthermore, fluoxetine inhibited the messenger RNA expression of chemokines such as Gro alpha, MIP1 alpha and 1 beta, and prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators after injury. Finally, fluoxetine attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved locomotor function after injury. Thus, our results indicate that fluoxetine improved functional recovery in part by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease activation and preventing blood-spinal cord barrier disruption after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our study suggests that fluoxetine may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity following ischaemic brain injury and spinal cord injury in humans.","glucose"

Twenty-one mature beagles were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated to maintain normal respiratory and acid-base balance. Somatosensory-evoked potentials from the upper and lower extremities were measured at regular intervals. The spinal cord at T-13 was loaded dorsally under precision loading conditions until evoked potential amplitudes had been reduced by 50%. At this functional endpoint, spinal cord displacement was maintained for either 30 (n = 7), 60 (n = 8), or 180 min (n = 6).

In both classes of gap junction, each channel is formed by two hemichannels, one contributed by each of the coupled cells. There is now general, if not universal, agreement that hemichannels of both classes can open in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli when they are not apposed to another hemichannels and face the external milieu. Connexin (and likely pannexin) hemichannel permeability is consistent with that of the cell-cell channels and open hemichannels can be a release site for relatively large molecules such as ATP and glutamate, which can serve as transmitters between cells. Here we describe three experimental paradigms in which connexin and pannexin hemichannel signaling occurs. (1) In cultures of spinal astrocytes FGF-1 causes the release of ATP, and ATP causes opening of pannexin hemichannels, which then release further ATP. Subsequently, several hours later, connexin hemichannels are also opened by an unknown mechanism. Release of ATP appears to become self sustaining through action of P2X7 receptors to open pannexin hemichannels and then connexin hemichannels, both of which are ATP permeable. (2) Spinal cord injury by dropping a small weight on the exposed cord is followed by release of ATP in the region surrounding the primary lesion. This release is greatly reduced in a mouse in which Cx43 is knocked down in the astrocytes. Application of FGF-1 causes a similar release of ATP in the uninjured spinal cord, and an inhibitor of the FGF-1 receptor, PD173074, inhibits both FGF-1 and injury-induced release. Reduction in ATP release is associated with reduced inflammation and less secondary expansion of the lesion. (3) Cortical astrocytes in culture are permeabilized by hypoxia, and this effect is increased by high or zero glucose. The mechanism of permeabilization is opening of Cx43 hemichannels, which can lead to cell death. Activated microglia secrete TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, which open connexin hemichannels in astrocytes. Astrocytes release ATP and glutamate which can kill neurons in co-culture through activation of neuronal pannexin hemichannels. These studies implicate two kinds of gap junction hemichannel in inflammatory responses and cell death.","glucose"

In this study, we characterize the functional properties of P2X7 receptors using electrophysiology and Ca2+ monitoring in primary cortical neuron cultures and in brain slices. Both electrical responses and Ca2+ influx induced by ATP and benzoyl-ATP were reduced by Brilliant Blue G (BBG) at concentrations which specifically inhibit P2X7 receptors. In turn, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) caused neuronal death that was reduced with BBC application. OGD in neuron cultures and brain slices generated an inward current, which was delayed and reduced by BOG. To assess the relevance of these in vitro findings, we used middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats as a model of transient focal cerebral ischemia to study the neuroprotective effect of BOG in vivo. Treatment with BBG (twice per day, 30 mg/kg) produced a 60% reduction in the extent of brain damage compared to treatment with vehicle alone. These results show that P2X7 purinergic receptors mediate tissue damage after OGD in neurons and following transient brain ischemia. Therefore, these receptors are a relevant molecular target for the development of new treatments to attenuate brain damage following stroke. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","glucose"

Therapeutic strategies have most commonly focused on protecting neurons from ischemic damage. However, ischemic damage to white matter causes oligodendrocyte death, myelin disruption, and axon dysfunction, and it is partially mediated by glutamate excitotoxicity. We have previously demonstrated that oligodendrocytes express ionotropic purinergic receptors. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of purinergic signaling in white matter ischemia. We show that, in addition to glutamate, enhanced ATP signaling during ischemia is also deleterious to oligodendrocytes and myelin, and impairs white matter function. Thus, ischemic oligodendrocytes in culture display an inward current and cytosolic Ca2+ overload, which is partially mediated by P2X7 receptors. Indeed, oligodendrocytes release ATP after oxygen and glucose deprivation through the opening of pannexin hemichannels. Consistently, ischemia-induced mitochondrial depolarization as well as oxidative stress culminating in cell death are partially reversed by P2X7 receptor antagonists, by the ATP degrading enzyme apyrase and by blockers of pannexin hemichannels. In turn, ischemic damage in isolated optic nerves, which share the properties of brain white matter, is greatly attenuated by all these drugs. Ultrastructural analysis and electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that P2X7 antagonists prevent ischemic damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin, and improved action potential recovery after ischemia. These data indicate that ATP released during ischemia and the subsequent activation of P2X7 receptor is critical to white matter demise during stroke and point to this receptor type as a therapeutic target to limit tissue damage in cerebrovascular diseases.

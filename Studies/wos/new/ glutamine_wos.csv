Still, there is no robust conceptual design to regenerate the damaged axon after spinal injury. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that human gingival derived neuronal stem cells (GNSCs) transplants in the injectable caffeic acid bioconjugated hydrogel (CBGH) helps to bridge the cavity and promote the engraftment and repopulation of transplants in the injured spinal tissue. Our study reports that the bioluminescence imaging in vivo imaging system (IVIS) provides a satisfactory progression in CBGH-GNSCs transplants compare to lesion control and CBGH alone. Immune regulators interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, neutrophil elastase are decreased, IL-10 is increased. Likewise, immunostaining (TAU/TUJ-1, SOX-2/NeuN, MAP-2/PSD93, NSE, S100b, and GFAP) shown repopulated cells. Also, TRA-1-81 expression confirms the absence of immune rejection in the CBGH-GNSCs transplants. However, locomotor recovery test, gene (IL-6, CASPASE3, p14-ARF, VEGF, LCAM, BDNF, NT3, NGN2, TrKc, FGF2, Sox-2, TUJ-1, MAP-2, Nestin, and NeuN) and protein expression (TAU, TUJ-1, SOX-2 MAP-2, PSD93, NeuN, TRA-1-81, GFAP, TAU, and MBP) shows functional improvements in the CBGH-GNSCs group. Further, GABA and glutamine level demonstrates the new synaptic vesicle formation. Hence, the CBGH scaffold enhances GNSCs transplants to restore the injured spinal tissue.","glutamine"

Despite recent advances in neurosciences, the treatment efficacy on SCI patients remains unsatisfactory, mainly due to the poor accumulation, short retention, and lack of controlled release of therapeutics in lesion tissue. Herein, an injured spinal cord targeting prodrug polymer micelle is built. An esterase-responsive bond is used to link apocynin (APO) monomer, because of the enhanced esterase activity found in microglia cells after activation, which ensures a controlled degradation of APO prodrug (Allyloxypolyethyleneglycol-b-poly [2-(((4-acetyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)carbonyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate], APEG-PAPO or PAPO) by activated microglia cells. A scar tissue-homing peptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) is introduced to the PAPO to endow the polymer micelle the lesion tissue-targeting ability. As a result, this CAQK-modified prodrug micelle (cPAM) exhibits an improved accumulation and prolonged retention in lesion tissue compared to the control micelle. The cPAM also leads to superior tissue protection and sustained motor function recovery than the control groups in a mouse model of SCI. In conclusion, the cPAM induces an effective treatment of SCI by the lesion tissue specific delivery of the prodrug polymer via its robust scar binding effect, making the scar tissue a drug releasing platform for sustained treatment of SCI.","glutamine"

The extent to which these changes have a prognostic value in the clinical recovery after surgical treatment is not yet known. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to test 2 primary hypotheses. 1) Based on evidence of corticospinal and spinocerebellar, rubro-, or reticulospinal tract degeneration/dysfunction during chronic spinal cord compression, the authors hypothesized that the metabolic profile of the primary motor cortices (M1s) and cerebellum, respectively, would be altered in patients with CSM, and these alterations would be associated with the extent of the neurological disabilities. 2) Considering that damage and/or plasticity in the remote motor system may contribute to clinical recovery, they hypothesized that M1 and cerebellar metabolic profiles would predict, at least in part, surgical outcome.","glutamine"

The beneficial effects of glutamine supplementation are related to heat shock protein induction and reduced inflammation, but its effects on skeletal muscle function, heat shock protein expression and inflammatory factors after spinal cord injury (SCI) are unknown. center dot What is the main finding and its importance? Using a mouse model of SCI, glutamine supplementation for 7 days following SCI was associated with significant improvements in muscle force, fatigue resistance and maintenance of contractile proteins versus placebo. Lower protein levels of heat shock proteins, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor- after SCI suggest that reduced stress is experienced by skeletal muscles with glutamine. The findings support glutamine as a therapeutic intervention to moderate inflammation and accelerate recovery of muscle function after SCI. Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of muscle function due to rapid breakdown of contractile proteins. Glutamine supplementation improves clinical outcomes, but its effects on muscle function after SCI are unknown. The benefits of glutamine in non-skeletal muscle tissues involve elevated heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp25, but the muscle response may differ because it is the largest contributor to plasma glutamine. We tested the hypothesis that glutamine preserves muscle function after SCI and that this is associated with increased heat shock protein and reduced inflammatory factors, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF). Changes in plantarflexor force, fatigability and total myofibrillar, Hsp70, Hsp25, IL-6 and TNF muscle protein levels were measured 7 days after sham or spinal cord transection surgery in mice receiving daily placebo or glutamine. Compared with placebo, after SCI glutamine significantly attenuated the reductions in maximal isometric force (0.22 +/- 0.01 versus 0.31 +/- 0.03 N, respectively) and fatigue resistance (34 +/- 4 versus 59 +/- 4% of initial force, respectively). Glutamine significantly ameliorated the loss of myofibrillar protein with spinal cord transection. Spinal cord transection was associated with decreased Hsp70 and Hsp25 with glutamine only (45 +/- 3 and 44 +/- 5% of placebo, respectively). Glutamine significantly reduced spinal cord transection-associated increases in IL-6 and TNF compared with placebo (38 +/- 6 and 37 +/- 8% of placebo, respectively). Functionally, early reductions in contractile protein, force and fatigue resistance after SCI were reversed with glutamine. Spinal cord transection-associated reductions in Hsp70, Hsp25, IL-6 and TNF with glutamine versus placebo suggest lower stress in the muscle, possibly related to a reduced need to produce glutamine. These findings support glutamine as a therapeutic intervention to accelerate recovery of muscle function after SCI.","glutamine"

Glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in oxidant scavenging. Maintenance of GSH concentrations after SCI lessens secondary injury and improves recovery. Since glutamine promotes GSH synthesis, this nonessential amino acid was examined for therapeutic potential. Denervation alters the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms within skeletal muscles. The hypotheses of this study were that glutamine administration to SCI rats would lead to improved functional recovery and more preserved MHC phenotypes in representative locomotor muscles. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: healthy, sham with laminectomy, laminectomized SCI untreated, and laminectomized SCI treated with glutamine. Functional performance was measured weekly for 6 wk using Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale and angle board methods. MHC composition of rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was determined using SDS-PAGE. Glutamine-treated rats had significantly higher angle board scores (P < 0.001) and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores (P < 0.01) than untreated SCI rats. Soleus of healthy rats contained 94% type 1 myosin isoform. Treated rats maintained 68%, which was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than 28% in untreated rats. The extensor digitorum longus of healthy rats contained 55% type 2b myosin. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in this isoform following SCI, but no significant difference between treated and untreated groups. There were strong correlations between higher functional scores and more preserved MHC phenotypes. Our findings suggest glutamine improves functional recovery and helps preserve myosin profile by reducing secondary SCI, thereby maintaining more nerves.","glutamine"

This study aimed to explore the protective effects of Baicalin on rats with spinal cord injury (SCI) and its mechanism of action. The recovery of spinal cord nerve function in rats was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score and the combine behavioral score (CBS). The expressions of cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Expressions of inflammation-related proteins were detected by Western blot. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed for serum metabolites. The BBB and CBS score results showed that Baicalin had a certain improvement on rats with SCI. SCI symptoms were significantly improved in low-dose and high-dose groups. The levels of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 in the SCI group were significantly increased. The expressions of NF-B p65, NF-B p50, p-IB, and IKK in the SCI group showed the opposite trend compared with the low-dose and high-dose groups. Compared with the sham group, glutamine, levels of 3-OH-butyrate, N-acetylaspartate, and glutathione were significantly reduced, and the levels of glutamate and betaine were significantly increased in the SCI group. When Baicalin was administered, the contents of glutamine synthase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) were significantly reduced, indicating that Baicalin had the effect of improving GS and GLS. Baicalin has protective effects on improving SCI and lower extremity motor function, has a significant anti-inflammatory effect, and regulates the serum metabolic disorder caused by SCI in rats.","glutamine"

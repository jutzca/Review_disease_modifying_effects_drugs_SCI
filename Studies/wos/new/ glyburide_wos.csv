Clinical trials form the optimal method to introduce new therapies into everyday clinical practice because they are a reliable source of unbiased evidence of effectiveness. Although many designs are available, parallel cohort trials are most widely applicable to acute disc herniation in dogs. In this review another key trial design decision-that between pragmatic and explanatory approaches-is highlighted and used as a theme to illustrate the close relationship between trial objective and design. Acute disc herniation, and acute spinal cord injury, is common in dogs and there is a multitude of candidate interventions that could be trialed. Most current obstacles to large-scale clinical trials in dogs can be overcome by collaboration and cooperation amongst interested veterinarians.","glyburide"

Progressive haemorrhagic necrosis (PHN) represents an increasingly well-characterised mechanism of secondary injury after tSCI that negatively impacts neurological outcomes following acute tSCI. Preclinical studies evaluating the use of the Food and Drug Administration-approved sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel blocker glyburide in rodent models have shown reduced secondary microhaemorrhage formation and the absence of capillary fragmentation, the pathological hallmark of PHN.","glyburide"

Glyburide (also known as glibenclarnide) is effective in reducing the severity of tissue destruction and improving functional outcome after experimental spinal cord injury in rodents and so has promise as a therapy in humans. There are many important differences between spinal cord injury in experimental animals and in human clinical cases, making it difficult to introduce new therapies into clinical practice. Spinal cord injury is also common in pet dogs and requires new effective therapies, meaning that they can act as a translational model for the human condition while also deriving direct benefits from such research. In this study we investigated the pharrnacokinetics land safety of glyburide in dogs with clinical spinal cord injury.","glyburide"

Although much effort and money has been expended on discovering effective agents for acute and subacute SCI, no agents that produce major benefit have been proven to date. The deficiencies of all aspects of the pipeline, including the basic science input and the clinical testing output, require examination to determine remedial strategies. Where has the neuroprotective/pharmacotherapy preclinical process failed and what needs to be done to achieve success? These are the questions raised in the present review, which has 2 objectives: 1) identification of articles that address issues related to the translational readiness of preclinical SCI pharmacological therapies; and 2) examination of the preclinical studies of 5 selected agents evaluated in animal models of SCI (including blunt force trauma, penetrating trauma, or ischemia). The 5 agents were riluzole, glyburide, magnesium sulfite, nimodipine, and minocycline, and these were selected because of their promise of translational readiness as determined by the North American Clinical Trials Network Consortium.","glyburide"

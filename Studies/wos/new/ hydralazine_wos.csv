Coadministration of the vasodilator hydralazine substantially eliminated the paralytic, anaerobic metabolic and neuropathological responses to dynorphin A. In contrast, in concentrations up to 1 mM, dynorphin A did not alter the viability of cultured rat spinal cord neurons. Thus, it appears that this peptide lacks direct neurotoxic effects and that neuronal injuries in vivo result primarily from ischemia associated with dynorphin A-induced blood flow reductions. NMDA receptor antagonists significantly improved recovery from dynorphin A-induced hindlimb paralysis, and substantially eliminated neuropathological changes without attenuating the acute blood flow reductions or lactic acid elevations. Additionally, glutamate and aspartate concentrations were increased significantly in spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid samples removed during the time that peptide-induced spinal cord blood flow reductions were observed. In contrast, neither amino acid concentration was elevated in media removed after 1-hr exposure of spinal cord neuronal cell cultures to 100 mu M concentrations of dynorphin A. These results indicate that the paralysis and spinal cord injuries produced in rats after spinal subarachnoid injection of dynorphin A result predominantly from spinal cord ischemia, and further identify excitatory amino acids and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mechanisms as important mediators in this injury model.","hydralazine"

Secondary injury processes not only exacerbate pathology at the site of primary injury, but also result in spreading of injuries to the adjacent, otherwise healthy tissue. The lipid peroxidation byproduct acrolein has been implicated as one potential mediator of secondary injury. To further and rigorously elucidate the role of acrolein in secondary injury, a unique ex vivo model is utilized to isolate the detrimental effects of mechanical injury from toxins such as acrolein that are produced endogenously following SCI. We demonstrate that (i) acrolein-Lys adducts are capable of diffusing from compressed tissue to adjacent, otherwise uninjured tissue; (ii) secondary injury by itself produces significant membrane damage and increased superoxide production; and (iii) these injuries are significantly attenuated by the acrolein scavenger hydralazine. Furthermore, hydralazine treatment results in significantly less membrane damage 2 h following compression injury, but not immediately after. These findings support our hypothesis that, following SCI, acrolein is increased to pathologic concentrations, contributes significantly to secondary injury, and thus represents a novel target for scavenging to promote improved recovery.","hydralazine"

However, free radical scavengers have been largely ineffective in clinical trials, and as such a novel target to attenuate oxidative stress is highly warranted. In addition to free radicals, peroxidation of lipid membranes following spinal cord injury (SCI) produces reactive aldehydes such as acrolein. Acrolein is capable of depleting endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione, generating free radicals, promoting oxidative stress, and damaging proteins and DNA. Acrolein has a significantly longer half-life than the transient free radicals, and thus may represent a potentially better target of therapeutic intervention to attenuate oxidative stress. There is growing evidence, from our lab and others, to suggest that reactive aldehydes such as acrolein play a critical role in oxidative stress and SCI. The focus of this review is to summarize the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of acrolein-induced membrane damage, mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, cell death, and functional loss. Evidence will also be presented to suggest that acrolein scavenging may be a novel means of therapeutic intervention to attenuate oxidative stress and improve recovery following traumatic SCI.","hydralazine"

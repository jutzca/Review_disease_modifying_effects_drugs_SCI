Herein, for the first time, we demonstrated the functional restoration of an injured spinal cord by the nano CeO(2)particles assembled onto poly (SMALL ELEMENT OF-caprolactone) (PCL)/resveratrol (RVL) were synthesized using the biocompatible ionic liquid. The as-prepared biocompatible nanomaterials were characterized and confirmed by using different instruments such as Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy for functional groups identification, X-ray diffraction for crystalline nature, Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy for morphological structure, Dynamic light scattering for size distribution of the nanoparticles and thermogravimetric analysis for thermal properties. The synergetic effect between the uniform distributions of nano-sized CeO(2)particles onto the PCL polymer with RVL can remarkably enhance the catalytic performance. Biofabricated nano-cerium oxide loaded PCL with RVL revealed that treatment significantly preserved hydrogen peroxide and also good catalytic performance. This study presents a nano-sized cerium oxide particles loaded PCL with RVL biocompatible materials have been providing highly efficient regenerative activity and biocompatibility in spinal card regeneration.","hydrogen_peroxide"

Mechanisms involving miRs induced apoptosis still needs to be investigated. In the present work we developed a rat model of SCI, followed by microarray analysis for expression of miRs at various time points after SCI. The locomotor activity was assessed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score, lesion volume was analyzed by cresyl violet staining and TUNEL staining for extent of apoptosis at various time points of post SCI. Numbers of miRs were altered after 2 weeks of SCI among which miR-466c-3p was the most significantly down-regulated. Transfection with miR-466c-3p mimics caused overexpression of miR-466c-3p, also improvement in functional recovery, decrease in apoptosis of neuronal cells and lesion size was observed in SCI rats. The Luciferase assay suggested that miR-466c-3p suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 (apoptosis regulator). It was also evidenced that upon restoring the levels of Bcl-2 with the help of pc-DNA3-Bcl-2 halted the attenuating action of miR-466c-3p in hydrogen peroxide exposed N9 microglia cells. The findings suggested that miR-466c-3p may inhibit mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via blocking Bcl-2 and cleaved capase-9/-3in rats after SCI. Altogether, the results suggested that miR-466c-3p may exert attenuating effect on functional recovery and inhibit the apoptosis of neuronal cells via halting the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade in SCI rats indicating that miR-466c-3p can be attractive therapeutic candidate in treating SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide"

Methods The cell viability, neurite growth, NF-kappa B, TNF alpha and IL-6 production from hydrogen peroxide-treated PC12 cells were analyzed. In-vivo, a total of 36 male C57 mice were divided into sham group, SCI group and TMP group (100 mg/kg). The protective effects of TMP were evaluated by Basso mouse scale (BMS) scores, HE staining, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Results TMP promoted neurite growth and inhibited TNF alpha, IL-6 and NF-kappa B signaling in a concentration-dependent mannerin vitro. Moreover, compared with the SCI group, the BMS scores and nerve regeneration showed a significant increase, while NF-kappa B signaling, TNF alpha and IL-6 production significantly decreased after TMP treatment. Conclusion TMP has a protective effect against SCIsin vitroandin vivo, which may be a potential strategy for future application in clinical practice.","hydrogen_peroxide"

Methods: In this study, 96 adult male albino rats were divided into 6 groups (16 rats each). Group 1 (G1) was the control group and received distilled H2O. Group 2 (G2) received daily NaNO2 (35 m/kg bwt/day) via subcutaneous injection for 3 weeks. Group 3 (G3) received NaNO2 for 2 weeks and were then injected once with 2*10(6) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) intravenously and sacrificed 4 weeks later. Group 4 (G4) received NaNO2 for 2 weeks and were then injected with 2*10(6) MSCs followed by daily NaNO2 injection for 1 week; rats in G4 were sacrificed 4 weeks from MSCs treatment. Group 5 (G5) rats were treated with NaNO2 for 2 weeks and then left to recover for 4 weeks. Finally, Group 6 (G6) rats were treated with NaNO2 for 3 weeks and left to recover for 3 weeks, after which point they were sacrificed. Results: The results showed that NaNO2 caused oxidative damage and histopathological alterations in the rat testes, as well as increased the levels of testes malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and DNA fragmentation percentage (DNA F %). Moreover, NaNO2 decreased the elevated activities of testes catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant activity (TAA), in comparison to the control group. The histological results illustrated different distortions, vacuolization and lipid accumulations in interlobular space as well as diminution of inter cellular germ cell layers, absence of Leydig cells, irregular basement membrane of tubule, and separation within spermatogenic cells. In addition, congestion and dilation of intertubular and peripheral blood capillaries were found. Nevertheless, the administration of stem cells reduced the danger actions of sodium nitrite by enhancing biochemical marker concentration.","hydrogen_peroxide"

Cell therapy constitutes a promising therapeutic approach for SCI; however, its clinical potential is seriously limited by their low survival in the hostile conditions encompassing the acute phase of SCI. Human HC016 (hHC016) cells, generated from expanded human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and pulsed with a patented protocol with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are expected to acquire improved resistance to oxidative environments which appears as a major limiting factor hampering the engrafting success. Our specific aim was to assess whether H2O2-pulsed hHC016 cells had an improved survival and thus therapeutic efficacy in a rat contusion model of acute SCI when grafted 48 hr after injury. Functional recovery was evaluated up to 56 days post-injury (dpi) by locomotor (open field test and CatWalk) and sensory (Von Frey and Hargreaves) tests. Besides, histological evaluation of transplanted cell survival and tissue protection/regeneration was also performed. Functional results showed a statistically significant improvement on locomotor recovery outcomes with hHC016 cells. Accordingly, superior cell survival in correlation with long-term neuroprotection, higher axonal regeneration, and reduced astroglial and microglial reactivity was also observed with hHC016 cells. These results demonstrate an enhanced survival capacity of hHC016 cells resulting in improved functional and histological outcomes as compared with hAMSCs, indicating that hHC016 cell transplants may constitute a promising cell therapy for acute SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide"

Recently, NISCH has been reported to be involved in the regulation of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Oxidative stress contributes to tissue injury and cell apoptosis during the development of various diseases, including SCI. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NISCH in the regulation of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in PC12 cells. H2O2 was used to establish an oxidative stress model in PC12 cells. Apoptosis levels were examined using flow cytometry analysis, and the expression of NISCH, Bcl-2, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3 were examined using western blot and immunofluorescence staining analyses. The results demonstrated that treatment with 100 mu M H2O2 significantly increased the apoptotic rate and expression of NISCH in PC12 cells. At 48 h following incubation with 100 mu M H2O2, NISCH downregulation partially inhibited apoptosis of PC12 cells. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly reduced and the expression of Bax and caspase-3 were significantly increased by H2O2 treatment. These effects were also partially inhibited by the downregulation of NISCH. The authors of the present study therefore hypothesize that NISCH may function as a pro-apoptotic protein that participates in the regulation of oxidative stress, and NISCH downregulation may protect cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.","hydrogen_peroxide"

However, the effect of riluzole on adult spinal cord-derived NSPCs remains unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of riluzole on NSPC survival both in vitro and in vivo. NSPCs harvested from the adult rat spinal cord were exposed to riluzole (1-30 mu M) either alone or in combination with hydrogen peroxide or glutamate in vitro. Measures of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell viability and proliferation were assessed. To examine the effects of riluzole on transplanted NSPCs in vivo, a rodent clip compression model of SCI was used. One week after injury, NSPCs were transplanted into the spinal cord and rats received either riluzole or vehicle treatment for two weeks (similar to the clinically accepted dosing regimen) at which time cords were processed for analysis. Exposure to riluzole (>= 10 mu M) for more than 48 h in vitro reduced NSPC viability. Riluzole treatment (1-10 mu M) did not significantly affect intracellular ROS levels or cell viability in the setting of in vitro oxidative stress. While glutamate (500 mu M) exposure for 96 h significantly increased adult NSPC proliferation and survival, this response was not blocked by concurrent treatment with riluzole (1-10 mu M) thus supporting the notion that the known anti-glutamatergic properties of riluzole are not mediated through direct inhibition of glutamate receptors. Furthermore, riluzole treatment did not impair the survival of transplanted NSPCs in a rodent model of SCI. These results suggest that although NSPCs may have a narrow tolerance to riluzole treatment in vitro, riluzole does not impair NSPC survival at doses that would be used clinically.

This research planned to dig the function and latent mechanisms of long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) ANRIL on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-disposed injury in PC-12 cells. The PC-12 cells were disposed with H2O2 for 24 h to construct the SCI model. H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cells was assessed by detecting cell viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis and autophagy. The level of ANRIL in H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cells was analysed, afterwards, the impacts of ANRIL silencing on H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cell injury was determined. The regulatory association between ANRIL and miR-499a, between miR-499a and PDCD4, as well as PDCD4 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signals were investigated. H2O2 produced PC-12 cell injury and promoted the level of ANRIL. Silencing of ANRIL inhibited H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cell injury through promoting cell viability, migration, invasion and inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, miR-499a was upregulated after silencing of ANRIL, and inhibition of miR-499a reversed the effects of silencing of ANRIL on H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cell injury. Also, PDCD4 was a target of miR-499a. Furthermore, ANRIL silencing alleviated the H2O2 -disposed injury in PC-12 cells possible by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signals, which was mediated by miR-499a/PDCD4 axis. Our results indicate that high level of ANRIL may sharpen the degree of SCI via targeting miR-499a/PDCD4 axis to regulate the briskness of PI31K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signals.","hydrogen_peroxide"

The present study evaluated the effects of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 on H2O2-injured pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells. Methods: H2O2 was used to induce injury in PC-12 cells. We then measured the effects of suppression of H19, downregulation of microRNA (miR)-155, and overexpression of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) on viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in H2O2-injured PC-12 cells in separate experiments. In these experiments, qRT-PCR was used to measure expression levels of different mRNAs and western blot analysis was used to measure different protein expressions. Results: H2O2 injured PC-12 cells by decreasing cell viability, migration, and invasion, and increasing apoptosis. Suppression of H19 expression further increased H2O2-induced injury in PC-12 cells. Suppression of H19 also increased miR-155 expression, which was identified as a target of H19 using luciferase reporter assay. Downregulation of miR-155 protected PC-12 cells from H2O2-induced injury. FOXO1 was identified as a target of miR-155, and expression of FOXO1 was decreased by miR-155 overexpression. RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that overexpression of FOXO1 decreased H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury by activating PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathways. Conclusion: These findings suggest that suppression of H19 expression promotes H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury, while downregulation of miR-155 and overexpression of FOXO1 protects PC-12 cells from H2O2-induced injury via activation of PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.","hydrogen_peroxide"

Here, we explore the potential proliferative and neuroprotective mechanism of melatonin on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). NSCs were induced from iPSCs, then pretreated with 500 mu M H2O2, 1 mu M melatonin, 1 mu M melatonin receptor antagonist (Luzindole), or 10 mu M Phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002). The results showed that melatonin stimulated proliferation of iPSC-derived NSCs on H2O2 exposure. Melatonin also markedly improved stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the rate of apoptosis. Treatment with Luzindole or LY294002 inhibited the increasing proliferative and neuroprotective effects of melatonin on iPSC-derived NSCs with H2O2 treatment. Our results further demonstrated that these promotional effects of melatonin were related with the activity of phosphorylation of AKT. Therefore, these outcomes propose that melatonin protects iPSC-derived NSCs from H2O2-induced injury through the mediation of melatonin receptor and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","hydrogen_peroxide"

To study the role of hsp70.1 in motor recovery following SCI, we assessed locomotor function in hsp70.1 knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) mice via the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, before and after spinal hemisection at T13 level. We also examined lesion size in the spinal cord using Luxol fast blue/cresyl violet staining. One day after injury, KO and WT mice showed no significant difference in the motor function due to complete paralysis following spinal hemisection. However, when it compared to WT mice, KO mice had significantly delayed and decreased functional outcomes from 4 days up to 21 days after SCI. KO mice also showed significantly greater lesion size in the spinal cord than WT mice showed at 21 days after spinal hemisection. These results suggest that Hsp70 has a protective effect against traumatic SCI and the manipulation of the hsp70.1 gene may help improve the recovery of motor function, thereby enhancing neuroprotection after SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide"

This interaction triggers intracellular signaling events leading to increased hydrogen peroxide levels which in turn promote filamentous actin (F-actin) destabilization and subsequent inhibition of axonal re-growth. In the current study, we demonstrated that treatment with galectin-1 (Gal-1), in its dimeric form, promotes a decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and F-actin repolimerization in the growth cone and in the filopodium of neuron surfaces. This effect was dependent on the carbohydrate recognition activity of Gal-1, as it was prevented using a Gal-1 mutant lacking carbohydrate-binding activity. Furthermore, Gal-1 promoted its own active ligand-mediated endocytosis together with the PlexinA4 receptor, through mechanisms involving complex branched N-glycans. In summary, our results suggest that Gal-1, mainly in its dimeric form, promotes re -activation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics via internalization of the PlexinA4/Gal-1 complex. This mechanism could explain, at least in part, critical events in axonal regeneration including the full axonal re-growth process, de novo formation of synapse clustering, axonal re-myelination and functional recovery of coordinated locomotor activities in an in vivo acute and chronic SCI model.","hydrogen_peroxide"

H2O2 was perfused through a microcannula into the uninjured rat spinal cord to mimic the conditions induced by SCI. Protein and DNA oxidation, membrane phospholipids peroxidation (MLP), cell death and apoptosis were characterized by histochemical and immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against markers of oxidation and apoptosis. Stained cells were quantified in sections of H2O2-, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)-exposed with vehicle-, or MnTBAP-treated groups. Compared with ACSF-exposed animals, SCI-elevated [H2O2] significantly increased intracellular protein and DNA oxidation by threefold and MLP by eightfold in neurons, respectively. H2O2-elevated extracellular malondialdehyde was measured by microdialysis sampling. We demonstrated that SCI-elevated [H2O2] significantly increased extracellular malondialdehyde above pre-injury levels. H2O2 also significantly increased cell loss and the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate( dUTP)-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive and active caspase-3-positive neurons by 2.3-, 2.8-, and 5.6-fold compared to ACSF controls, respectively. Our results directly and unequivocally demonstrate that SCI-elevated [H2O2] contributes to post-SCI MLP, protein, and DNA oxidation to induce cell death. Therefore, we conclude that (1) the role of H2O2 in secondary SCI is pro-oxidation and pro-cell death, (2) apoptosis is a pathway for SCI-elevated [H2O2] to induce cell death, (3) caspase activation is a mechanism of H2O2-induced apoptosis after SCI, and (4) MnTBAP treatment significantly decreased H2O2-induced oxidation, cell loss, and apoptosis to the levels of ACSF controls, further supporting MnTBAP's ability to scavenge H2O2 by in vivo evidence.

Additional analyses revealed that FGF2 priming protected cultured DPCs from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death and increased the number of DPCs in the SCI rat spinal cord even 7 weeks after transplantation. The production of major neurotrophic factors was equivalent in FGF2-treated and untreated DPCs. These observations suggest that FGF2 priming might protect DPCs from the post-trauma microenvironment in which DPCs infiltrate and resident immune cells generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Surviving DPCs could increase the availability of neurotrophic factors in the lesion site, thereby promoting axonal regeneration and locomotor function recovery.","hydrogen_peroxide"

SCO-spondin stimulates neuronal differentiation and neurite growth in vitro. NX210 oligopeptide was designed from SCO-spondin's specific thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) sequences that support the main neurogenic properties of the molecule. The objective of this work was to assess the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties of NX210 in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). In vitro studies were carried out on the B104 neuroblastoma cell line demonstrating neuroprotection by the resistance to oxidative damage using hydrogen peroxide and the measure of cell viability by metabolic activity. In vivo studies were performed in two rat models of SCI: (1) a model of aspiration of dorsal funiculi followed by the insertion of a collagen tube in situ to limit collateral sprouting; white matter regeneration was assessed using neurofilament immunostaining; (2) a rat spinal cord contusion model to assess functional recovery using BBB scale and reflex testing. We demonstrate for the first time that NX210 (a) provides neuroprotection to oxidative stress in the B104 neuroblastoma cells, (b) stimulates axonal regrowth in longitudinally oriented neofibers in the aspiration model of SCI and (c) significantly improves functional recovery in the contusive model of SCI.","hydrogen_peroxide"

However, the low survival rate of grafted MSC is one of the most important problems. In the injured spinal cord, transplanted cells are exposed to hypoxic conditions and exposed to nutritional deficiency caused by poor vascular supply. Also, the transplanted MSCs face cytotoxic stressors that cause cell death. The aim of this study was to compare adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) isolated from individual C57BL6/J mice in relation to: (i) cellular characteristics, (ii) tolerance to hypoxia, oxidative stress and serum-free conditions, and (iii) cellular survival rates after transplantation. AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs exhibited a similar cell surface marker profile, but expressed different levels of growth factors and cytokines. To research their relative stress tolerance, both types of stromal cells were incubated at 20.5% O-2 or 1.0% O-2 for 7 days. Results showed that AD-MSCs were more proliferative with greater culture viability under these hypoxic conditions than BM-MSCs. The MSCs were also incubated under H2O2-induced oxidative stress and in serum-free culture medium to induce stress. AD-MSCs were better able to tolerate these stress conditions than BMMSCs; similarly when transplanted into the spinal cord injury region in vivo, AD-MSCs demonstrated a higher survival rate post transplantation Furthermore, this increased AD-MSC survival post transplantation was associated with preservation of axons and enhanced vascularization, as delineated by increases in anti-gamma isotype of protein kinase C and CD31 immunoreactivity, compared with the BM-MSC transplanted group. Hence, our results indicate that AD-MSCs are an attractive alternative to BM-MSCs for the treatment of severe spinal cord injury. However, it should be noted that the motor function was equally improved following moderate spinal cord injury in both groups, but with no significant improvement seen unfortunately following severe spinal cord injury in either group.","hydrogen_peroxide"

The cleavage of phospholipids by cPLA(2) leads to release of fatty acids, and in particular arachidonic acid (AA), the metabolites of which have been associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the inhibition of cPLA(2) following SCI leads to tissue protection and an improved functional outcome. Adult rats received compression SCI and 30 min after injury they were treated intravenously with either saline or the cPLA(2) inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) (7.13 mg/kg). The animals were sacrificed at 7 days post-injury and the lesioned tissue was labeled using markers for neurons, oligodendrocytes, and macrophages/activated microglia.

But, there is an increase in OL lineage cells after SCI that may represent a reparative response, and there is evidence for remyelination after SCI. To assess the role of axonal degeneration per se in OL apoptosis and proliferation, we cut the L2-S2 dorsal roots producing massive axonal degeneration and microglial activation in the DC, and found no evidence of OL loss or apoptosis. Rather, the numbers of OL-lineage cells positive for NG2 and APC (CC1) increased, and BrdU studies suggested new OL formation. We then tested contusion SCI (cSCI) that results in comparable degeneration in the DC rostral to the injury, microglial activation, and apoptosis of DC OLs by eight days. NG2+ cell proliferation and oligodendrogenesis was seen as after rhizotomy. The net result of this combination of proliferation and apoptosis was a reduction in DC OLs, confirming earlier studies. Using an antibody to oxidized nucleic acids, we found rapid and prolonged RNA oxidation in OLs rostral to cSCI, but no evidence of oxidative stress in DC OLs after rhizotomy.

Treatment with hUCB after SCI altered the expression of several MMPs in rats. MMP-2 is upregulated after hUCB treatment in spinal cord injured rats and in spinal neurons injured either with staurosporine or hydrogen peroxide. Further, hUCB induced upregulation of MMP-2 reduced formation of the glial scar at the site of injury along with reduced immunoreactivity to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Blockade of MMP-2 activity in hUCB cocultured injured spinal neurons reduced the protection offered by hUCB which indicated the involvement of MMP-2 in the neuroprotection offered by hUCB. Based on these results, we conclude that hUCB treatment after SCI upregulates MMP-2 levels and reduces the formation of the glial scar thereby creating an environment suitable for endogenous repair mechanisms.

Anti-CD11d mAb treatment clearly attenuated these responses. In conclusion, anti-CD11d mAb treatment significantly reduces intraspinal free radical formation caused by infiltrating leukocytes after SCI, thereby reducing secondary cell death. These effects likely underlie tissue preservation and improved neurological function that result from the mAb treatment.","hydrogen_peroxide"

GBS is a significant cause of new long-term disability for at least 1,000 persons per year in the United States, and more elsewhere. Given the young age at which GBS sometimes occurs and the relatively long life expectancies following GBS, it is likely that at least 25,000 and perhaps 50,000 persons in the US are experiencing some residual effects of GBS. Approximately 40% of patients who are hospitalized with GBS will require admission to inpatient rehabilitation. For GBS persons necessitating admission to inpatient rehabilitation, the requirement of prior ventilator support most strongly predicts an extended length of stay on inpatient rehabilitation. Other issues that affect rehabilitation are dysautonomia, cranial nerve involvement, and various medical complications associated with GBS. Deafferent pain syndrome is common in the early stages of recovery. Multiple medical complications, including deep venous thrombosis, joint contractures, hypercalcemia of immobilization, and decubitii, may develop in the early stages of recovery and interfere with the rehabilitation program. Anemia is a frequent finding in the first few months of illness but does not appear to interfere with functional recovery. Therapy should not overfatigue the motor unit, which has been associated with paradoxical weakening. Little is known of the long-term implications of the disability caused by GBS. Work similar to that performed for postpolio syndrome and spinal cord injury should be started in the rehabilitation setting.

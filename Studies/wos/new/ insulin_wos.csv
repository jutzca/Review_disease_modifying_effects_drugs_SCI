Here we demonstrate that the spinal cord of mice consuming HFHS expresses reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor and shows impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle function, reductions in PLP and increases in astrogliosis, all prior to SCI. After SCI, Western diet impaired sensorimotor and bladder recovery, increased microgliosis, exacerbated oligodendrocyte loss and reduced axon sprouting. Direct and indirect neural injury mechanisms are suggested since HFHS culture conditions drove parallel injury responses directly and indirectly after culture with conditioned media from HFHS-treated astrocytes. In each case, injury mechanisms included reductions in IGF-1R, SIRT1 and PGC-1 alpha and were prevented by metformin. Results highlight the potential for a Western diet to evoke signs of neural insulin resistance and injury and metformin as a strategy to improve mechanisms of neural neuroprotection and repair.","insulin"

The effects of insulin on cells within the central nervous system are varied, and can include both metabolic and non-metabolic functions. Emerging data suggests that insulin can improve neuronal survival or recovery after trauma or during neurodegenerative diseases. Further, data suggests a strong anti-inflammatory component of insulin, which may also play a role in both neurotrauma and neurodegeneration. As a result, administration of exogenous insulin, either via systemic or intranasal routes, is an increasing area of focus in research in neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disorders. This review will explore the literature to date on the role of insulin in neurotrauma and neurodegeneration, with a focus on traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).","insulin"

Differences in axonal signalling in response to injury that might underpin this differential regenerative ability are poorly characterized. Combining axoplasmic proteomics from peripheral sciatic or central projecting dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons with cell body RNA-seq, we uncover injury-dependent signalling pathways that are uniquely represented in peripheral versus central projecting sciatic DRG axons. We identify AMPK as a crucial regulator of axonal regenerative signalling that is specifically downregulated in injured peripheral, but not central, axons. We find that AMPK in DRG interacts with the 26S proteasome and its CaMKII alpha-dependent regulatory subunit PSMC5 to promote AMPK alpha proteasomal degradation following sciatic axotomy. Conditional deletion of AMPK alpha 1 promotes multiple regenerative signalling pathways after central axonal injury and stimulates robust axonal growth across the spinal cord injury site, suggesting inhibition of AMPK as a therapeutic strategy to enhance regeneration following spinal cord injury.","insulin"

Here, some visceral deficits of acute and chronic midline cervical (C5) contusion are similarly examined. Cranially implanted wireless stimulators delivered intermittent 8 Hz, 30-70 mu A cathodal pulse trains to a brainstem microelectrode. Injured controls were given inactive stimulators; rats without injuries or implants were also compared. Rectal distension or squeezing of the forepaws caused an exaggerated rise in mean arterial pressure in injured, untreated rats under anesthesia on post-injury week 6, probably reflecting autonomic dysreflexia (AD). These pressor responses became normal when 7 days of unilateral PAG stimulation was started on the injury day. Older untreated injuries (weeks 18-19) showed normal pressor responses, but unexpectedly had significant resting and nociceptive bradycardia, which was reversed by 3 weeks of PAG stimulation started on weeks 7 or 12. Subsequent chronic studies examined gastric emptying (GE), as indicated by intestinal transit of gavaged dye, and serum chemistry. GE and fasting serum insulin were reduced on injury weeks 14-15, and were both normalized by similar to 5 weeks of PAG stimulation begun in weeks 7-8. Increases in calcitonin gene-related peptide, a prominent visceral afferent neurotransmitter, measured near untreated injuries (first thoracic segment) in superficial dorsal laminae were reversed by acutely or chronically initiated PAG stimulation. The NRM, given 2-3 weeks of stimulation beginning 2 days after SCI, prevented abnormalities in both pressor responses and GE on post-injury week 9, consistent with its relaying of repair commands from the PAG. The descending PAG-NRM axis thus exhibits broadly restorative influences on visceral as well as sensory-motor deficits, improving chronic as well as acute signs of injury.","insulin"

The M1 phenotype exacerbates neuroinflammation, whereas the M2 phenotype promotes tissue repair and provides anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we compared the effects of M2 and M1 microglia transplantation on SCI. First, we established a method for effective induction of M1 or M2 microglia by exposure to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin (IL)-4, respectively, to be used for transplantation in a SCI mouse model. In the M2 microglia transplantation group, significant recovery of motor function was observed compared with the control and M1 groups. Elevated transcription of several neuroprotective molecules including mannose receptor C type 1 (Mrc1), arginase 1 (Arg1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) was observed. Moreover, intramuscular injection of FluoroRuby dye revealed recovery of retrograde axonal transport from the neuromuscular junction to upstream of the injured spinal cord only in the M2-transplanted group, although the number of migrated microglia were comparable in both M1 and M2 groups. In conclusion, our results indicated that M2 microglia obtained by IL-4 stimulation may be a promising candidate for cell transplantation therapy for SCI.","insulin"

HSV-IGF-1 transfection enhanced EA-induced neuroplasticity, which manifested as partial recovery in locomotor function, remission hyperpathia, growth of DRG-derived spared fibers, increased expression of phosphorylated (p-) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, and increased pPI3K/PI3K and pAkt/Akt expression ratios.

Immunofluorescence results showed that intradiencephalon HA administration increased the activated microglia 3 days post injury (dpi), promoted the proliferation of radial glial cells at 7 dpi and affected the morphology of radial glial cells at 11 dpi. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that intradiencephalon HA administration also reduced the expression of neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factorl (IGF-1) at the lesion site, however, had no effect on the expression of pro inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta.

Lack of effective pharmacotherapies for SCI is mainly attributable to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. Stimulator of interferon gene (Sting), also known as Transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), activates the type I interferon-regulated innate immune response, playing crucial role in modulating inflammation. However, the mechanism underlying Sting activation in SCI is still unclear. Here, we reported that Sting functioned as a positive regulator of SCI. Sting expression was increased in the injured spinal cord samples of SCI mice, along with significantly up-regulated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6. Suppressing Sting expression in lipopolysaccharide-incubated mouse microglia markedly reduced the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways, as illustrated by the decreased phosphorylation of IKK beta, I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B/p65, p38, ERK1/2 and JNK. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglial cells was also reversed by Sting knockdown. In contrast, LPS-induced inflammation was further accelerated in microglial cells with Sting over-expression through potentiating NF-kappa B and MAPKs signaling. Mechanistically, Sting directly interacted with the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), thus promoting its phosphorylation and the activation of down-streaming NF-kappa B and MAPKs signaling pathways. Notably, the effects of Sting on SCI progression were verified in mice. Consistently, Sting knockout alleviated inflammatory response and facilitated recovery after SPI in mice through blocking TBK1 activation and subsequent NF-kappa B and MAPKs phosphorylation. In summary, our findings may provide a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of SCI by targeting Sting. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.","insulin"

The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) score was recorded from days 1 to 16 post-injury, and the survival, migration, differentiation and neurotrophic factor (NTF) expression in vivo were detected. In vitro and in vivo, the expanded NSCs were able to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes, and secreted a variety of NTFs, including ciliary NTF, transforming growth factor-1, glial cell line-derived NTF, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived NTF and insulin-like growth factor. Following transplantation, the BBB score in the TSs with chronic-stage transplantation exhibited a statistically significant increase, while there was no significant difference in the acute group, compared with the control group. This corresponded with the marked upregulation of NGF indicated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Rats in the SCT and NSC groups were all subjected to SCT in T10, and were administered with media and NSC transplantation into the lesion site, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to label Nestin-, TUNEL-, and NeuN-positive cells and reveal the expression and location of type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1 R). Locomotor function of hind limbs was assessed by Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) score and inclined plane test. The conduction velocity and amplitude of spinal nerve fibers were measured by electrophysiology and the anatomical changes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, expression of IGF-1 R was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results showed that NSCs could survive and differentiate into neurons in vitro and in vivo. SCT-induced deficits were reduced by NSC transplantation, including increase in NeuN-positive cells and decrease in apoptotic cells. Moreover, neurophysiological profiles indicated that the latent period was decreased and the peak-to-peak amplitude of spinal nerve fibers conduction was increased in transplanted rats, while morphological measures indicated that fractional anisotropy and the number of nerve fibers in the site of spinal cord injury were increased after NSC transplantation. In addition, mRNA and protein level of IGF-1 R were increased in the rostral segment in the NSC group, especially in neurons. Therefore, we concluded that NSC transplantation promotes motor function improvement of SCT, which might be associated with activated IGF-1 R, especially in the rostral site. All of the above suggests that this approach has potential for clinical treatment of spinal cord injury.","insulin"

We found that exosomes derived from obese rat MSCs showed decreased miR-21 levels and did not exert protective effects against SCI. Overexpression of miR-21 in obese rat MSCs restored the protective effects of exosomes purified from obese rat MSCs against SCI. In addition, obese rat MSCs showed insulin resistance, and MSC insulin resistance decreased miR-21 levels in its secreted exosomes. These results suggested that miR-21 deficiency in obese rat MSCs contributes to the impaired protective effects of obese rat MSCs-derived exosomes against SCI, and further reinforced the notion that miR-21 is a potential molecule for treatment of SCI.

Here, we aimed to obtain genetic evidence that IGF-1 signaling in the transplanted NSCs determines the beneficial effects of TMT. We transplanted NSCs heterozygous (+I-) for Igf1r, the gene encoding IGF-1 receptor, into the mouse spinal cord after injury, with or without combining TMT. We analyzed the influence of genotype and TMT on locomotor recovery and survival and migration of NSC grafts. In vitro experiments were performed to examine the potential roles of IGF-1 signaling in the migratory ability of NSCs. Mice receiving +/- NSC grafts showed impaired locomotor recovery compared with those receiving wild-type (+/+) NSCs. Locomotor improvement by TMT was more pronounced with +/+ grafts. Deficiency of one allele of Igf1r significantly reduced survival and migration of the transplanted NSCs. Although TMT did not significantly influence NSC survival, it substantially enhanced the extent of migration for only +/+ NSCs. Cultured neurospheres exhibited dynamic motility with cytoplasmic protrusions, which was regulated by IGF-1 signaling. IGF-1 signaling in transplanted NSCs may be essential in regulating their survival and migration. Furthermore, TMT may promote NSC graft-mediated locomotor recovery via activation of IGF-1 signaling in transplanted NSCs. Dynamic NSC motility via IGF- 1 signaling may be the cellular basis for the TMT-induced enhancement of migration.","insulin"

The current methods generally require a long period of time (>2 months) to obtain transplantable OPCs, which hampers their clinical utility for patients with SCI. Here we demonstrate a rapid and efficient method to differentiate hPSCs into neural progenitors that retain the features of OPCs (referred to as OPC-like cells). We used cell sorting to select A2B5-positive cells from hPSC-derived neural rosettes and cultured the selected cells in the presence of signaling cues, including sonic hedgehog, PDGF and insulin-like growth factor-1. This method robustly generated neural cells positive for platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRa) and NG2 (similar to 90%) after 4 weeks of differentiation. Behavioral tests revealed that the transplantation of the OPC-like cells into the spinal cords of rats with contusive SCI at the thoracic level significantly improved hindlimb locomotor function. Electrophysiological assessment revealed enhanced neural conduction through the injury site. Histological examination showed increased numbers of axon with myelination at the injury site and graft-derived myelin formation with no evidence of tumor formation.

Our data validated previously described sensitivity of miRNAs to SCI alone. Moreover, following SCI, intermittent noxious stimulation decreased expression of miR124 in dorsal spinal cord 24 h after stimulation and increased expression of miR129-2 in dorsal, and miR1 in ventral spinal cord at 7 days. We also found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated 1 day after SCI alone, and significantly more so, after SCI followed by tailshock. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression was significantly increased at both 1 and 7 days postSCI, and significantly more so, 7 days post-SCI with shock. MiR1 expression was positively and significantly correlated with IG F-1, but not BDNF mRNA expression. Further, stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that a significant proportion of the changes in BDNF and IGF-1 mRNA expression were explained by variance in two groups of miRNAs, implying co-regulation. Collectively, these data show that uncontrollable nociception which activates sensonmotor circuits distal to the injury site, influences SCI-miRNAs and target mRNAs within the lesion site. SCI-sensitive miRNAs may well mediate adverse consequences of uncontrolled sensonmotor activation on functional recovery. However, their sensitivity to distal sensory input also implicates these miRNAs as candidate targets for the management of SCI and neuropathic pain.","insulin"

Promising candidates include Schwann cells (SCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). Both cell types are thought to be neural crest derived and share many properties in common, although OECs appear to be a better candidate for transplantation by evoking less astrogliosis. Using CNS mixed myelinating rat cultures plated on to a monolayer of astrocytes, we demonstrated that SCs, but not OECs, secrete a heat labile factor(s) that inhibits oligodendrocyte myelination. Comparative qRT-PCR and ELISA showed that SCs expressed higher levels of mRNA and protein for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) than OECs. Anti-CTGF reversed the SCM-mediated effects on myelination. Both SCM and CTGF inhibited the differentiation of purified rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Furthermore, pretreatment of astrocyte monolayers with SCM inhibited CNS myelination and led to transcriptional changes in the astrocyte, corresponding to upregulation of bone morphogenic protein 4 mRNA and CTGF mRNA (inhibitors of OPC differentiation) and the downregulation of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA (promoter of OPC differentiation). CTGF pretreatment of astrocytes increased their expression of CTGF, suggesting that this inhibitory factor can be positively regulated in astrocytes. These data provide evidence for the advantages of using OECs, and not mature SCs, for transplant-mediated repair and provide more evidence that they are a distinct and unique glial cell type.","insulin"

Several studies have suggested that growth factor-promoted axonal regeneration can occur for an extended period after injury. More importantly, the delivery of exogenous growth factors contained in PRP, such as EGF, IGF-1, and TGF-beta, has neurotrophic effects on central nervous system (CNS) injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

This article reviews recent research progress of the role of neural stem cells in the repair of peripheral nerve injury. Neural stem cells can not only differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but can also differentiate into Schwann-like cells, which promote neurite outgrowth around the injury. Transplanted neural stem cells can differentiate into motor neurons that innervate muscles and promote the recovery of neurological function. To promote the repair of peripheral nerve injury, neural stem cells secrete various neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. In addition, neural stem cells also promote regeneration of the axonal myelin sheath, angiogenesis, and immune regulation. It can be concluded that neural stem cells promote the repair of peripheral nerve injury through a variety of ways.","insulin"

The major drawback of this compound is its inhibitory effect on proliferation of hMSCs. Therefore, we investigated whether fine-tuning of the dose and timing of PKA activation could enhance bone formation even further, with minimum effects on proliferation. To test this, we selected two different PKA activators (8-bromo-cAMP (8-br-cAMP) and forskolin) and compared their effects on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation with those of db-cAMP. We found that all three compounds induced alkaline phosphatase levels, bone-specific target genes, and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1, although 8-br-cAMP induced adipogenic differentiation in long-term cultures and was thus considered unsuitable for further in vivo testing. All three compounds inhibited proliferation of hMSCs in a dose-dependent manner, with forskolin inhibiting proliferation most. The effect of forskolin on in vivo bone formation was tested by pretreating hMSCs before implantation, and we observed greater amounts of bone using forskolin than db-cAMP. Our data show forskolin to be a novel agent that can be used to increase bone formation and also suggests a role for PKA in the delicate balance between adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation.","insulin"

Here we studied the regenerative potential of NPCs, IGF-I-transduced or not, in a mouse model of hippocampal mechanical injury. NPC transplantation, with or without IGF-I transduction, rescued the injury-induced spatial learning deficits as revealed in the Morris Water Maze. Moreover, it had beneficial effects on the host tissue by reducing astroglial activation and microglial/macrophage accumulation while enhancing generation of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells. One or two months after transplantation the grafted NPCs had migrated towards the lesion site and in the neighboring myelin-rich regions. Transplanted cells differentiated toward the oligodendroglial, but not the neuronal or astrocytic lineages, expressing the early and late oligodendrocyte markers NG2, Olig2, and CNPase. The newly generated oligodendrocytes reached maturity and formed myelin internodes.

Sixteen weeks after SCI, body weights of injured female rats stabilized and were significantly lower than surgical control animals. At the same time point, SCI rats had a significantly lower whole body fat: lean tissue mass ratio than controls, as measured indirectly by NMR. Despite lower body weight and fat mass, the cumulative consumption of standard laboratory chow ( 4.0 kcal/ g) and mean energy intake ( kcal center dot day(-1) center dot 100 g body wt(-1)) of chronic SCI rats was significantly more than controls. Glucose tolerance tests indicated a significant enhancement in glucose handling in 16-wk SCI rats, which were coupled with lower serum insulin levels. The post mortem weight of gonadal and retroperitoneal fat pads was significantly reduced after SCI and IBAT displayed significantly lower real-time PCR expression of UCP1 mRNA. The reduced fat mass and IBAT UCP1 mRNA expression are contraindicative of the cumulative caloric intake by the SCI rats. The prolonged postinjury loss of body weight, including fat mass, is not due to hypophagia but possibly to permanent changes in gastrointestinal transit and absorption, as well as whole body homeostatic mechanisms.","insulin"

Relatively little work has investigated these post-SCI systemic changes, however, despite considerable evidence that multiple organ system dysfunction contributes to chronic impairments in health. Because metabolic dysfunction is common after SCI and the liver is a pivotal site for metabolic homeostasis, we sought to determine if liver pathology occurs as a result of SCI in a rat spinal contusion model. Histologic evidence showed excess lipid accumulation in the liver for at least 21 days post-injury after cervical or midthoracic SCI. Lipidomic analysis revealed an acute increase in hepatic ceramides as well as chronically elevated lactosylceramide. Post-SCI hepatic changes also included increased proinflammatory gene expression, including interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, chemokine ligand-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA. These were coincident with increased CD68+ macrophages in the liver through 21 days post-injury. Serum alanine transaminase, used clinically to detect liver damage, was significantly increased at 21 days post-injury, suggesting that early metabolic and inflammatory damage preceded overt liver pathology. Surprisingly, liver inflammation was even detected after lumbar SCI. Collectively, these results suggest that SCI produces chronic liver injury with symptoms strikingly similar to those of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (fatty liver disease). These clinically significant hepatic changes after SCI are known to contribute to systemic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome, all of which are more prevalent in persons with SCI.

This may be secondary to exercise-intensity-dependent increases in neurotrophin expression demonstrated previously in control subjects. However, rigorous examination of intensity-dependent changes in neurotrophin levels is lacking in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of locomotor exercise intensity on peripheral levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in individuals with incomplete SCI. We also explored the impact of the Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the BDNF gene on intensity-dependent changes. Serum concentrations of BDNF and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), as well as measures of cardiorespiratory dynamics, were evaluated across different levels of exercise intensity achieved during a graded-intensity, locomotor exercise paradigm in 11 individuals with incomplete SCI. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in serum BDNF at high, as compared to moderate, exercise intensities (p = 0.01) and 15 and 30 min post-exercise (p < 0.01 for both), with comparison to changes at low intensity approaching significance (p = 0.05). Serum IGF-1 demonstrated no intensity-dependent changes. Significant correlations were observed between changes in BDNF and specific indicators of exercise intensity (e.g., rating of perceived exertion; R = 0.43; p = 0.02). Additionally, the data suggest that Val66Met SNP carriers may not exhibit intensity-dependent changes in serum BDNF concentration. Given the known role of BDNF in experience-dependent neuroplasticity, these preliminary results suggest that exercise intensity modulates serum BDNF concentrations and may be an important parameter of physical rehabilitation interventions after neurological injury.","insulin"

Combination of TMT with NSC TP at 1 week after injury synergistically improved locomotor function. We report here that combining TMT increased the survival of grafted NSCs by >3-fold and >5-fold at 3 and 9 weeks after injury, respectively. The number of surviving NSCs was significantly correlated with the extent of locomotor recovery. NSCs grafted into the injured spinal cord were under cellular stresses induced by reactive nitrogen or oxygen species, which were markedly attenuated by TMT. TMT increased the concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the CSF. Intrathecal infusion of neutralizing IGF-1 antibodies, but not antibodies against either BDNF or Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), abolished the enhanced survival of NSC grafts by TMT. The combination of TP and TMT also resulted in tissue sparing, increased myelination, and restoration of serotonergic fiber innervation to the lumbar spinal cord to a larger extent than that induced by either TP or TMT alone. Therefore, we have discovered unanticipated beneficial effects of TMT in modulating the survival of grafted NSCs via IGF-1.

In these subjects BDNF concentration at rest was sixfold higher compared with the concentrations reported earlier in able-bodied persons, while IGF-1, PRL and COR were within normal range. Ten minutes of moderate intensity handbiking (54% of the maximal heart rate) during a warm-up period (W) induced an increase (P<0.05) of BDNF of approximately 1.5-fold from basal level at rest, while a decrease to basal level was found after an immediately succeeding handbiking time trial (89% of the maximal heart rate) over the marathon distance of 42 km (M). An increase (P<0.01) of serum IGF-1 was found after W and this levels remained elevated (P<0.01) until the end of M. W had no significant effects on the serum PRL and COR, however, M induced an increase (P<0.01) of both hormones. This is the first study showing elevated BDNF concentrations at rest in spinal cord-injured athletes. Furthermore, short moderate intensity handbiking but not immediately following long lasting high intensity handbiking further increases serum BDNF concentrations. IGF-1 response to exercise differs to BDNF response as this neuroplasticity-related protein remains elevated during the long lasting physical demand with high intensity. The augmented PRL concentration suggests that a possible mechanism by which exercise promotes neuroplasticity might be the activation of neural serotonergic pathways as 5-HT is the main PRL releasing factor. Elevated COR concentrations after M are unlikely to be deleterious to neuroplasticity as COR concentrations remain within the physiological range. The present study suggests that exercise might be beneficial to enhance neuroprotection and neuroplasticity, thereby improving recovery after spinal cord injury. (C) 2008 IBRO.

To test this hypothesis, intact (n = 10) and paraplegic (n = 6) male Wistar rats were chronically instrumented to measure atrioventricular ( AV) interval, sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time (SNRT), SNRT corrected for spontaneous sinus cycle (cSNRT), Wenckebach cycle length (WCL), and the electrical stimulation threshold to induce ventricular arrhythmias.

Synthetic PPAR gamma agonists (e.g. thiazolidinediones) are used to treat Type II diabetes and have the potential to limit the risk of developing brain injuries such as stroke by mitigating the influence of comorbidities. If brain injury develops, PPAR gamma serves as a master gatekeeper of cytoprotective stress responses, improving the chances of cellular survival and recovery of homeostatic equilibrium. In the acute injury phase, PPAR gamma directly restricts tissue damage by inhibiting the NFKI3 pathway to mitigate inflammation and stimulating the Nrf2/ARE axis to neutralize oxidative stress. During the chronic phase of acute brain injuries, PPAR gamma activation in injured cells culminates in the repair of gray and white matter, preservation of the blood brain barrier, reconstruction of the neurovascular unit, resolution of inflammation, and long-term functional recovery. Thus, PPAR gamma lies at the apex of cell fate decisions and exerts profound effects on the chronic progression of acute injury conditions. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of PPAR gamma in stroke and brain trauma and highlight the novel role of PPAR gamma in long-term tissue repair. We describe its structure and function and identify the genes that it targets. PPAR gamma regulation of inflammation, metabolism, cell fate (proliferation/differentiation/maturation/survival), and many other processes also has relevance to other neurological diseases.

This compound affected the subacute phase by modulating microglial response and by increasing local production of insulin-like growth factor-I, known to be a key player in neuronal survival and neurogenesis. The relative wide therapeutic window, coupled with its efficacy in attenuating further degeneration and enhancing restoration, makes poly-YE a promising immune-based candidate for stroke therapy.

In this study, a rat model was used to investigate the effect of treadmill exercise on SCI-induced apoptosis and expression of neurotrophic factors. To produce SCI, a contusion injury (10 g x 25 mm) was applied subsequent to laminectomy at the T9-T10 level. Following SCI, treadmill exercise was performed for six weeks. Hindlimb motor function was evaluated with a grid-walking test. The expression of neurotrophic factors and the level of apoptosis at the site of SCI were determined by western blotting. SCI reduced hindlimb motor function and suppressed expression of neurotrophin (NT)-3 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the ratio of phosphorylated Akt to Akt (pAkt/Akt) and the ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) to Bax (Bcl-2/Bax) were decreased, and cleaved caspase-3 expression was increased by SCI. Treadmill exercise enhanced hindlimb motor function and increased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), NT-3 and IGF-1 in the SCI rats. Treadmill exercise increased PI3K expression, the pAkt/Akt and the Bcl-2/Bax ratios, and suppressed cleaved caspase-3 expression in the injured spinal cord. This study demonstrated that treadmill exercise promotes the recovery of motor function by suppressing apoptosis in the injured spinal cord. The beneficial effect of exercise may be attributed to the increase in expression of neurotrophic factors via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.","insulin"

There were no synergistic effects of combining exercise and fluoxetine treatment. Recent reports have also shown that exercise induces molecular mechanisms that benefit the spinal cord and can improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI); therefore, we repeated the assays in the spinal cord. Results showed that BDNF, IGF-1 and neurogenesis behave independently in the hippocampus and spinal cord. BDNF protein did not change in the spinal cord with either wheel running or fluoxetine treatment. Spinal cord IGF-1 protein did not change with wheel running, but it decreased with fluoxetine (high dose). Furthermore, spinal cord cytogenesis decreased with fluoxetine treatment. The combined wheel running and fluoxetine groups did not show synergistic results. Thus, the hippocampus and the spinal cord respond in distinct ways to wheel running and fluoxetine, and a prior induction of BDNF, IGF-1 or cytogenesis is unlikely to be the mechanism for wheel running providing a margin of protection against SCI.

Generally it is thought that spinal neural networks of motor- and interneurons located in the ventral and intermediate laminae within the lumbar intumescence of the spinal cord, also referred to as central pattern generators (CPGs), are the 'producers of locomotion' and play a pivotal role in the amelioration of locomotor deficits after SCI. It has been suggested that locomotor training provides locomotor-specific sensory feedback into the CPGs, which stimulates remodeling of central nervous system pathways, including motor systems. Several molecules have been proposed to potentiate this process but the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. To understand these mechanisms, we studied the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I in functional recovery from SCI under normal and enriched environment (EE) housing conditions. In a first experiment, we discovered that subcutaneous administration of IGF-I resulted in better locomotor recovery following SCI. In a second experiment, detailed analysis of the observed functional recovery induced by EE revealed full recovery of hindlimb coordination and stability of gait. This EE-dependent functional recovery was attenuated by alterations in the pre-synaptic bouton density within the ventral gray matter of the lumbar intumescence or CPG area. Neutralization of circulating IGF-I significantly blocked the effectiveness of EE housing on functional recovery and diminished the EE-induced alterations in pre-synaptic bouton density within the CPG area. These results support the use of IGF-I as a possible therapeutic aid in early rehabilitation after SCI.","insulin"

IGF-I secreting cell grafts promoted growth Of raphespinal and cerulospinal axons, but not corticospinal axons, into the lesion/graft site. We then examined whether IGF-I-secreting cell grafts promote corticospinal motor neuron survival or axon growth in a subcortical axotomy model. IGF-I expression coupled with infusion of the IGF binding protein inhibitor NBI-31772 significantly prevented corticospinal motor neuron death (93% cell survival compared to 49% in controls, P<0.05), but did not promote corticospinal axon regeneration. Coincident with observed effects of IGF-I on corticospinal Survival but not growth, expression of IGF-I receptors was restricted to the somal compartment and not the axon of adult corticospinal motor neurons. Thus, whereas IGF-I influences corticospinal axonal growth during development, its application to sites of adult spinal cord injury or subcortical axotomy fails to promote corticospinal axonal regeneration under conditions that are sufficient to prevent corticospinal cell death and promote the growth of other supraspinal axons. We conclude that developmental patterns of growth factor responsiveness are not simply recapitulated after adult injury, potentially due to post-natal shifts in patterns of IGF-I receptor expression.

We assessed the time course of expression of PTN, MK and FGF-2 during EAE and determined the cellular origin of FGF-2 and FGFR1 in normal spinal cord and during inflammatory demyelination. Basal expression of PTN and MK mRNAs in normal spinal cords was significantly upregulated after induction of EAE.

FGF-2 mRNA expression was low in normal spinal cord and dramatically increased in correlation with progressive demyelination. FGF-2 was confined to neurons in normal tissue and shifted dramatically to microglia, paralleling their activation during EAE.

We reactivated the growth capacity of mature descending propriospinal neurons with osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor before SCI14,15; induced growth-supportive substrates with fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor; and chemoattracted propriospinal axons with glial-derived neurotrophic factor(16,17) delivered via spatially and temporally controlled release from biomaterial depots(18,19), placed sequentially after SCI. We show in both mice and rats that providing these three mechanisms in combination, but not individually, stimulated robust propriospinal axon regrowth through astrocyte scar borders and across lesion cores of non-neural tissue that was over 100-fold greater than controls. Stimulated, supported and chemoattracted propriospinal axons regrew a full spinal segment beyond lesion centres, passed well into spared neural tissue, formed terminal-like contacts exhibiting synaptic markers and conveyed a significant return of electrophysiological conduction capacity across lesions. Thus, overcoming the failure of axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions after maturity required the combined sequential reinstatement of several developmentally essential mechanisms that facilitate axon growth. These findings identify a mechanism-based biological repair strategy for complete SCI lesions that could be suitable to use with rehabilitation models designed to augment the functional recovery of remodelling circuits.","insulin"

DNA microarray analysis revealed that neurons highly expressed receptors of IGF-1 and TGF-beta 1. However, their expression indices remained unchanged even after the CM treatment. The individual trophic factors mentioned above or their combinations were less effective at promoting neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth than the CM.

In the present study, trophic factor expression was characterized in uninjured, injured-untreated, injured-treated with transplanted cells, and corresponding control tissue from the adult rat spinal cord. Candidate trophic factors were identified in a literature search, and primers were designed for these genes. We examined in vivo trophin expression in 3 paradigms involving transplantation of either brain or spinal cord-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Injury without further treatment led to a significant elevation of nerve growth factor (NGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and lower expression of vascular endothelial growth factor isoform A (VEGF-A) and platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A). Transplantation of NPCs led to modest changes in trophin expression, and the co-administration of intrathecal trophins resulted in significant elevation of the neurotrophins, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), LIF, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). BMSCs transplantation upregulated NGF, LIF, and IGF-1. NPCs isolated after transplantation into the injured spinal cord expressed the neurotrophins, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and bFGF at higher levels than host cord.

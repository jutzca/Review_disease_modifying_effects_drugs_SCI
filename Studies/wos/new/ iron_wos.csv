Established literature has shown that oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of acute CNS injuries. Recently, there have been many studies on the topic of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Some studies have revealed an emerging connection between acute CNS injuries and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, induced by the abnormal metabolism of lipids, glutathione (GSH), and iron, can accelerate acute CNS injuries. However, pharmaceutical agents, such as iron chelators, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), and liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), can inhibit ferroptosis and may have neuroprotective effects after acute CNS injuries. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this connection has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this paper, we discuss the general mechanisms of ferroptosis and its role in stroke, TBI, and SCI. We also summarize ferroptosis-related drugs and highlight the potential therapeutic strategies in treating various acute CNS injuries. Additionally, this paper suggests a testable hypothesis that ferroptosis may be a novel direction for further research of acute CNS injuries by providing corresponding evidence.","iron"

It appears to contribute to the death of tumors, ischemia-reperfusion, acute renal failure, and nervous system diseases, among others. The generative mechanism of ferroptosis includes iron overloading, lipid peroxidation, and downstream execution, while the regulatory mechanism involves the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, as well as the mevalonate pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. In-depth research has continuously developed and enriched knowledge on the mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs. In recent years, reports of the noninterchangeable role played by selenium in glutathione peroxidase 4 and its function in suppressing ferroptosis and the discovery of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, identified as a ferroptosis resistance factor parallel to the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, have expanded and deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which ferroptosis works. Ferroptosis has been reported in spinal cord injury animal model experiments, and the inhibition of ferroptosis could promote the recovery of neurological function. Here, we review the latest studies on mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs, focusing on the ferroptosis execution and the contents related to selenium and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. In addition, we summarize the current research status of ferroptosis in spinal cord injury. The aim of this review is to better understand the mechanisms by which ferroptosis occurs and its role in the pathophysiological process of spinal cord injury, so as to provide a new idea and frame of reference for further exploration.","iron"

We explored trajectories of surface morphology, demyelination and iron concentration within the basal ganglia-thalamic circuit over 2 years post-SCI. This allowed us to explore the predictive value of neuroimaging biomarkers and determine their suitability as surrogate markers for interventional trials. Changes in markers of surface morphology, myelin and iron concentration of the basal ganglia and thalamus were estimated from 182 MRI datasets acquired in 17 SCI patients and 21 healthy controls at baseline (1-month post injury for patients), after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Using regression models, we investigated group difference in linear and non-linear trajectories of these markers. Baseline quantitative MRI parameters were used to predict 24-month clinical outcome. Surface area contracted in the motor (i.e. lower extremity) and pulvinar thalamus, and striatum; and expanded in the motor thalamus and striatum in patients compared to controls over 2-years. In parallel, myelin-sensitive markers decreased in the thalamus, striatum, and globus pallidus, while iron-sensitive markers decreased within the left caudate. Baseline surface area expansions within the striatum (i.e. motor caudate) predicted better lower extremity motor score at 2-years. Extensive extrapyramidal neurodegenerative and reorganizational changes across the basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry occur early after SCI and progress over time; their magnitude being predictive of functional recovery. These results demonstrate a potential role of extrapyramidal plasticity during functional recovery after SCI.","iron"

Here, we hypothesized that DFO ameliorates spinal cord compression by promoting neovascularization. Using an SCI model of moderate compression, rats were intraperitoneally injected with 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg DFO for 1-2 weeks, and significant neovascularization was found in the injured spinal cord, showing overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and an increase in the number of new blood vessels. In addition, SCI in rats was significantly ameliorated after treatment with DFO, with less motor dysfunction, increased spared neural tissue, and improved electrophysiological conduction. By contrast, the ameliorative effect of DFO on SCI was suppressed when DFO-induced neovascularization was blocked by lenvatinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, further suggesting that the primary pharmacological effect of DFO in SCI is the promotion of neovascularization. Therefore, we concluded that DFO effectively alleviated SCI by promoting neovascularization in the injured spinal cord. Considering that DFO is an FDA-approved free radical scavenger and iron chelator, it may represent a promising alternative strategy for SCI therapy in the future.","iron"

This lipid peroxidation is catalyzed by labile ferric iron. Therefore, iron import mediated via transferrin receptors and both, enzymatic and non-enzymatic iron-dependent radical formation are crucial prerequisites for the execution of ferroptosis. Intriguingly, the dynamin inhibitor dynasore, which has been shown to block transferrin receptor endocytosis, can protect from ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as neuronal cell death following spinal cord injury. Yet, it is unknown how dynasore exerts these cell death-protective effects. Using small interfering RNA suppression, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron tracers and bona fide inducers of ferroptosis, we find that dynasore treatment in lung adenocarcinoma and neuronal cell lines strongly protects these from ferroptosis. Surprisingly, while the dynasore targets dynamin 1 and 2 promote extracellular iron uptake, their silencing was not sufficient to block ferroptosis suggesting that this route of extracellular iron uptake is dispensable for acute induction of ferroptosis and dynasore must have an additional off-target activity mediating full ferroptosis protection. Instead, in intact cells, dynasore inhibited mitochondrial respiration and thereby mitochondrial ROS production which can feed into detrimental lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death in the presence of labile iron. In addition, in cell free systems, dynasore showed radical scavenger properties and acted as a broadly active antioxidant which is superior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in blocking ferroptosis. Thus, dynasore can function as a highly active inhibitor of ROS-driven types of cell death via combined modulation of the iron pool and inhibition of general ROS by simultaneously blocking two routes required for ROS and lipid-ROS driven cell death, respectively. These data have important implications for the interpretation of studies observing tissue-protective effects of this dynamin inhibitor as well as raise awareness that off-target ROS scavenging activities of small molecules used to interrogate the ferroptosis pathway should be taken into consideration.","iron"

Methods: A novel algorithm was developed which automatically adjusts 1) the intensity of functional electrical stimulation (FES) delivered to the leg muscles, and 2) the current delivered to an electric motor. The algorithm automatically switches between assistive, uncontrolled, and resistive modes to accommodate for differences in functional impairment, based on the mismatch between the desired and actual cadence. Lyapunov-based methods were used to theoretically prove that the rider's cadence converges to the desired cadence range. To demonstrate the controller's real-world performance, nine chronic stroke survivors performed two cycling trials: 1) volitional effort only and 2) volitional effort accompanied by the control algorithm assisting and resisting pedaling as needed. Results: With a desired cadence range of 50-55 r/min, the developed controller resulted in an average rms cadence error of 1.90 r/min, compared to 6.16 r/min during volitional-only trials. Conclusion: Using FES and an electric motor with a two-sided cadence control objective to assist and resist volitional efforts enabled stroke patients with varying strength and abilities to pedal within a desired cadence range.

Administration of ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg) to SCI rats enhanced 5hmC levels; increased the expression of the Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 genes within the brain motor cortex; promoted axonal sprouting within the lesion cavity of the spinal cord; and enhanced recovery of locomotor function until 12 weeks. In conclusion, we found that epigenetic status in the brain motor cortex is changed after SCI and that epigenetic modulation using ascorbic acid may contribute to functional recovery after SCI.","iron"

Therefore, we determined the NE and 5-HT content, in the pons and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) as well as motor deficit and spontaneous activity in rats after 3, 10 and 20 days cortical iron injection. Three days post-lesion the pontine NE content diminished, this effect was accompanied by deficient spontaneous activity and impaired sensorimotor evaluation. Ten and twenty days after lesion the NE levels were similar to those of control group, and animals also showed behavioral recovery. Monoamines content on DG 3 days post-lesion showed no differences as compared to controls. Interestingly, ten and twenty days after cortical injury, animals showed increased NE and 5-HT. These results suggest that behavioral recovery after brain damage involve changes on monoamines levels on DG, an important structure to plastic processes.

Here, we propose an in vitro labelling strategy for multimodal in vivo observation of macrophage dynamics distinguished from brain-residing microglia response. Prior to intracerebral transplantation into the striatum of recipient mice or systemic administration, monocytes and macrophages, isolated from luciferase- expressing mice, were labelled with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. Temporo-spatial localization was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging, whereas survival of grafted cells was investigated using bioluminescence imaging. The labelling procedure of the isolated cells did not significantly influence cell characteristics and resulted in detection of as few as 500 labelled cells in vivo. Two weeks after stereotactic transplantation, the luciferase signal was sustained traceable, with approximately 18% of the original luciferase signal detectable for monocytes and about 30% for macrophages. Hypointensity in MRI of the graft appeared unaltered in spatial location. In a therapeutically relevant approach, systemic cell administration after stroke resulted in accumulation mostly in thoracic regions, as could be visualized with BLI. For detection of homing to ischemic brain tissue more cells need to be administered. Nevertheless, during parallel MRI sessions recruitment of i.v. injected cells to the lesion site could be detected by day 2 post stroke as scattered hypointense signal voids. With further increase in sensitivity, our multi-facetted labelling strategy will provide the basis for in vivo tracking and fate specification of tissue-infiltrating macrophages and their distinct role in stroke-related neuro-inflammation.","iron"

The administration of steroids has several side-effects that jeopardize their use and therefore safer chemical neuro-entities are required. Natural compounds such as curcumin (anti-oxidant) and quercetin (anti-inflammatory) have been investigated as alternative neuroactive, but are not as potent as the steroids. Hence, they are required in very high doses which may lead to significant toxicity causing an increase in cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, active iron chelation, inhibiting the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. A reduction in the dose of these neuroactives is possible with the administration of a 'chemically-variant' permutation with additive or synergistic therapeutic benefits. Therefore, we hypothesize that curcumin and quercetin, both natural polyphenolic flavonoids, can ""additively and synergistically"" improve the physiological outcome after traumatic SCI when used in combination and termed 'Cur(Que)min' - thereby decreasing the dose levels and hence reducing the inherent high dose-cytotoxicity of the individual neuroactives.

However, SCs show poor migratory ability within the astrocyte-rich central nervous system (CNS) environment and exhibit only limited integration with host astrocytes. Our strategy for improving the therapeutic potential of SCs was to magnetically drive SCs to migrate across the astrocyte-SC boundary to intermingle with astrocytes. SCs were firstly magnetized with poly-L-lysine-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Internalization of SPIONs showed no effect upon the migration of SCs in the absence of a magnetic field (MF). In contrast, magnetized SCs exhibited enhanced migration along the direction of force in the presence of a MF. An inverted coverslip assay showed that a greater number of magnetized SCs migrated longer distances onto astrocytic monolayers under the force of a MF compared to other test groups. More importantly, a confrontation assay demonstrated that magnetized SCs intermingled with astrocytes under an applied MF. Furthermore, inhibition of integrin activation reduced the migration of magnetized SCs within an astrocyte-rich environment under an applied MF. Thus, SPION-mediated forces could act as powerful stimulants to enhance the migration of SCs across the astrocyte-SC boundary, via integrin-mediated mechanotransduction, and could represent a vital way of improving the therapeutic potential of SCs for spinal cord injuries.","iron"

Literature suggests that benefits are visible with the reduction in concentration of iron and activated microglia in SCI. Magnetic field attenuates oxidative stress and promotes axonal regeneration in vitro and in vivo. The present study demonstrates the potential of extremely low frequency magnetic field to attenuate microglia-and iron-induced secondary injury in SCI rats. Complete transection of the spinal cord (T13 level) was performed in male Wistar rats and subsequently exposed to magnetic field (50 Hz, 17.96 mu T) for 2 h daily for 8 weeks.

Histology, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed significant reduction in lesion volume, microglia, macrophage, collagen tissue and iron content, whereas, a significantly higher vascular endothelial growth factor expression around the epicenter of the lesion in SCI + MF group as compared to SCI group.

Routine histological techniques were used for subsequent investigation of the observed neuropathology at the microscopic level. The central core of the lesion appeared as a dark hypo-intense area on MR images at all time points investigated. Small focal hypo-intense spots were also observed spreading through the dorsal funiculi proximal and distal to the site of impact, an area that is known to undergo gliosis and Wallerian degeneration in response to injury. Histological examination revealed these hypo-intense spots to be high in iron content as determined by Prussian blue staining. Quantitative image analysis confirmed the increased presence of iron deposits at all post-injury time points investigated (p < 0.05). Distant iron deposits were also detectable through live imaging without the use of contrast-enhancing agents, enabling the longitudinal investigation of this pathology in individual animals. Further immunohistochemical evaluation showed that intracellular iron deposits localised to macrophages/microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the subacute phase of SCI, but predominantly to glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive, CC-1-positive astrocytes at later stages of recovery. Progressive, widespread intracellular iron accumulation is thus a normal feature of SCI in mice, and high-resolution MRI can be effectively used to detect and monitor these neuropathological changes with time.

We therefore investigated the mode of action of DFO in serum-starved and/or iron-stressed cultures of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. We probed for redox signaling by determining hemeoxygenase-I activity and by measuring expression of intracellular iron metabolism-related proteins under pro-oxidative conditions. We also employed DNA microarrays to better understand the genomic response of DRG cultures to treatment with DFO thereby enabling the generation of hypotheses. Essentially, DFO treatment resulted in outgrowth of neurofilament 200-positive neurites and induction of synapse formation as determined by immunoblotting, transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Furthermore, DFO treatment of DRG cell cultures activated neuroprotective and antioxidative programs such as matrix metallopeptidase 2 and apolipoprotein D to promote neurite regeneration. Indeed, DFO reduced markedly reactive oxygen species formation, increased the expression of hemeoxygenase-I and improved iron management through regulation of transferrin receptor and ferritin. We propose DFO treatment of DRG cell cultures to completely abolish the oxidative effect of ferrous iron (Fe2+). Taken collectively, DFO reduced oxidative stress and induced synthesis of neuroprotective and antioxidative molecules to foster nerve repair and functional recovery. Our findings help to better understand the therapeutic benefit of DFO in the treatment of spinal cord injury. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier GmbH.","iron"

The collagen-rich glial-fibrous scar contains numerous axon growth inhibitory factors forming a regeneration-barrier for axons. We demonstrated previously that the combination of the iron chelator 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-decarboxylic acid (BPYDCA) and 8-Br-cyclic AMP (cAMP) inhibits scar formation and collagen deposition, leading to enhanced axon regeneration and partial functional recovery after spinal cord injury. While BPY-DCA is not a clinical drug, the clinically approved iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) may be a suitable alternative for anti-scarring treatment (AST). In order to prove the scar-suppressing efficacy of DFO we modified a recently published in vitro model for CNS scarring. The model comprises a co-culture system of cerebral astrocytes and meningeal fibroblasts, which form scar-like clusters when stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We studied the mechanisms of TGF-beta-induced CNS scarring and compared the efficiency of different putative pharmacological scar-reducing treatments, including BPY-DCA, DFO and cAMP as well as combinations thereof. We observed modulation of TGF-beta-induced scarring at the level of fibroblast proliferation and contraction as well as specific changes in the expression of extracellular matrix molecules and axon growth inhibitory proteins. The individual and combinatorial pharmacological treatments had distinct effects on the cellular and molecular aspects of in vitro scarring. DFO could be identified as a putative anti-scarring treatment for CNS trauma. We subsequently validated this by local application of DFO to a dorsal hemisection in the rat thoracic spinal cord. DFO treatment led to significant reduction of scarring, slightly increased regeneration of corticospinal tract as well as ascending CGRP-positive axons and moderately improved locomotion. We conclude that the in vitro model for CNS scarring is suitable for efficient pre-screening and identification of putative scar-suppressing agents prior to in vivo application and validation, thus saving costs, time and laboratory animals.","iron"

It has yet to be clarified whether ferroptosis inhibition represents the mechanism of action of Deferoxamine on spinal cord injury recovery. A rat model of Deferoxamine at thoracic 10 segment was established using a modified Allen's method. Ninety 8-week-old female Wistar rats were used. Rats in the Deferoxamine group were intraperitoneally injected with 100 mg/kg Deferoxamine 30 minutes before injury. Simultaneously, the Sham and Deferoxamine groups served as controls. Drug administration was conducted for 7 consecutive days. The results were as follows: (1) Electron microscopy revealed shrunken mitochondria in the spinal cord injury group. (2) The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating score showed that recovery of the hindlimb was remarkably better in the Deferoxamine group than in the spinal cord injury group. (3) The iron concentration was lower in the Deferoxamine group than in the spinal cord injury group after injury. (4) Western blot assay revealed that, compared with the spinal cord injury group, GPX4, xCT, and glutathione expression was markedly increased in the Deferoxamine group.

Here we tested the hypothesis that this unexpected injury-potentiating effect of neurotrophins would also take place in the adult rat spinal cord. Fe3+-citrate was injected stereotaxically into spinal cord gray matter in adult rats in amounts sufficient to produce minimal tissue injury 24 It later. Twenty-four-hour pretreatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, or neurotrophin-4/5, but not nerve growth factor, markedly enhanced tissue injury in the gray matter as evidenced by an increase in the damaged area, as well as the loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes.

An optimal treatment to reverse or prevent damage would be to deliver an iron chelator systemically. Thus, we tested oral delivery of deferasirox (Exjade) in multiple studies using a rat model of mid-thoracic spinal contusion. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received a moderate contusion at vertebral level T8 and were given daily deferasirox for the first 7 or 14 days post-injury. The first two studies showed modest improvements in hindlimb function with limited improvement in tissue sparing. Two subsequent experiments to assess chronic functional changes and test longer-duration treatments failed to produce significant improvements. Testing a 2-fold higher deferasirox dose resulted in toxic side effects. To verify iron chelation treatment was effective, hepatic iron levels were measured which revealed that deferasirox robustly and significantly reduced systemic iron levels. Overall, this study suggests that oral iron chelation with deferasirox may lead to small but significant improvements in locomotor recovery or tissue sparing. However, given the lack of robust beneficial effects combined with potentially detrimental side effects such as exacerbated systemic anemia, oral administration of iron chelators may not be ideal for minimizing intraspinal iron-mediated pathology after SCI.

Inflammatory mediators are prevalent during both phases and can influence the fate of NG2 cells and OLs. Specifically, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling induces OL genesis in the naive spinal cord, and lack of TLR4 signaling impairs white matter sparing and functional recovery after SCI. Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR4 signaling may regulate oligodendrogenesis after SCI. C3H/HeJ (TLR4-deficient) and control (C3H/HeOuJ) mice received a moderate midthoracic spinal contusion. TLR4-deficient mice showed worse functional recovery and reduced OL numbers compared with controls at 24 h after injury through chronic time points. Acute OL loss was accompanied by reduced ferritin expression, which is regulated by TLR4 and needed for effective iron storage. TLR4-deficient injured spinal cords also displayed features consistent with reduced OL genesis, including reduced NG2 expression, fewer BrdU-positive OLs, altered BMP4 signaling and inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) expression, and delayed myelin phagocytosis. Expression of several factors, including IGF-1, FGF2, IL-1 beta, and PDGF-A, was altered in TLR4-deficient injured spinal cords compared with wild types. Together, these data show that TLR4 signaling after SCI is important for OL lineage cell sparing and replacement, as well as in regulating cytokine and growth factor expression. These results highlight new roles for TLR4 in endogenous SCI repair and emphasize that altering the function of a single immune-related receptor can dramatically change the reparative responses of multiple cellular constituents in the injured CNS milieu.","iron"

We investigated axonal sprouting along with the efficiency of the infusion of the stromal cell-derived growth factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) and regenerative growth along with the anti-scarring treatment (AST) in young (2-3 months) and geriatric (22-28 months) female rats following SCI. AST included local injection of iron chelator (2,2'-dipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid) and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate solution into the lesion core. Axon outgrowth was investigated by immunohistological methods at 5 weeks after a partial dorsal hemisection at thoracic level T8. We found that aging significantly reduces spontaneous axon sprouting of corticospinal (CST), serotonergic (5-HT) raphespinal and catecholaminergic (TH) coerulospinal tracts in distinct regions of the spinal cord rostral to the lesion. However, impairment of axon sprouting could be markedly attenuated in geriatric animals by local infusion of SDF-1. Unexpectedly and in contrast to rostral sprouting, aging does not diminish the regenerative growth capacity of 5-HT-, TH- and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive axons at 5 weeks after SCI. Moreover, 5-HT and TH axons maintain the ability to react upon AST with significantly enhanced regeneration in aged animals. These data are the first to demonstrate, that old age compromises axonal plasticity, but not regenerative growth, after SCI in a fiber tract-specific manner. Furthermore, AST and SDF-1 infusions remain efficient, which implicates that therapy in elderly patients is still feasible. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","iron"

Our group and others have implicated the transcriptional activator HIF-1 in some of the salutary effects of iron chelation-induced PHD inhibition. While some iron chelators are currently employed in humans for conditions such as hemochromatosis, the diverse utilization of iron in physiological processes in the brain makes the development of HIF activators that do not bind iron a high priority. Here we report the development of a high throughput screen to develop novel HIF activators and/or PHD inhibitors for therapeutic use in the central nervous system (CNS). We show that tilorone, a low-molecular weight, antiviral, immunomodulatory agent is the most effective activator of the HIF pathway in a neuronal line. We also show that tilorone enhances HIF protein levels and increases the expression of downstream target genes independent of iron chelation and HIF PHD inhibition in vitro. We further demonstrate that tilorone can activate an HIF-regulated reporter gene in the CNS. These studies confirm that tilorone can penetrate the blood-brain barrier to activate HIF in the CNS. As expected from these findings, we show that tilorone provides effective prophylaxis against permanent ischemic stroke and traumatic spinal cord injury in male rodents. Altogether these findings identify tilorone as a novel and potent modulator of HIF-mediated gene expression in neurons with neuroprotective properties.","iron"

Prussian Blue staining was used to determinate the labeling efficiency. Rats were randomly divided into three groups, control group, hUC-MSCs group, and SPIO-labeled hUC-MSCs group. All groups were subjected to spinal cord injury (SCI) by weight drop device. Rats were examined for neurological function. In vivo MRI was used to track SPIO-labeled hUC-MSCs transplanted in rats spinal cord. Survival and migration of hUC-MSCs were also explored using immunofluorescence. Significant improvements in locomotion were observed in the hUC-MSCs groups. There was statistical significance compared with control group. In vivo MRI 1 and 3 weeks after injection showed a large reduction in signal intensity in the region transplanted with SPIO-labeled hUC-MSCs. The images from unlabeled hUC-MSCs showed a smaller reduction in signal intensity. Transplanted hUC-MSCs engrafted within the injured rats spinal cord and survived for at least 8 weeks. In conclusion, hUC-MSCs can survive and migrate in the host spinal cord after transplantation, which promote functional recovery after SCI.

It has been shown to target multiple secondary injury mechanisms in spinal cord injury, via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The secondary injury mechanisms that MH can potentially target include inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, ischemia, hemorrhage, and edema. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of the multifaceted actions of MH. Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are partially achieved through conserved mechanisms such as modulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways as well as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Additionally, MH can directly inhibit calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mitochondrial calcium uptake, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzymatic activity, and iron toxicity. It can also directly scavenge free radicals. Because it can target many secondary injury mechanisms, MH treatment holds great promise for reducing tissue damage and promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury.","iron"

The loading of stem cells with engineered SPIONs that guarantees sufficient attractive magnetic forces was achieved. Further, the magnetic system allowed rapid guidance of the SPION-labelled cells precisely to the lesion location. Histological analysis of cell distribution throughout the cerebrospinal channel showed a good correlation with the calculated distribution of magnetic forces exerted onto the transplanted cells.

Next, NSC grafting itself may not only result in the regeneration of lost tissue, but more importantly has the potential to improve functional outcome through many bystander mechanisms. In the second part of this review, we will briefly discuss several pre-clinical studies that contributed to a better understanding of the therapeutic potential of NSC grafts in vivo.

Lcn2 expression at the protein level is rapidly increased 12-fold at 1 d after SCI and decreases gradually thereafter, being three times as high as control levels at 21 d after injury. Lcn2 expression is strongly induced after contusion injury in astrocytes, neurons, and neutrophils. The Lcn2 receptor (Lcn2R), which has been shown to influence cell survival, is also expressed after SCI in the same cell types. Lcn2-deficient (Lcn2(-/-)) mice showed significantly better locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury than wild-type (Lcn2(+/+)) mice. Histological assessments indicate improved neuronal and tissue survival and greater sparing of myelin in Lcn2(-/-) mice after contusion injury. Flow cytometry showed a decrease in neutrophil influx and a small increase in the monocyte population in Lcn2(-/-) injured spinal cords. This change was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of several pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase early after SCI in Lcn2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type animals.

This efficacy is correlated with a reduction in markers of oxygen radical-induced LP. Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing in spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and ischemic stroke.

Due to accumulation of numerous axon-growth inhibitory molecules the lesion scar is considered a major impediment for axon regeneration. Following transection of the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) at thoracic level 8 in adult rats, transient suppression of collagenous scarring in the lesion zone by local application of a potent iron chelator and cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulted in the delay of fibrous scarring. Treated animals displayed long-distance growth of CST axons through the lesion area extending for up to 1.5-2 cm into the distal cord. In addition, the treatment showed a strong neuroprotective effect, rescuing cortical motoneurons projecting into the CST that normally die (30%) after thoracic axotomy. Further, anterogradely traced CST axons regenerated through both grey and white matter and developed terminal arborizations in grey matter regions. In contrast to controls, injured animals receiving treatment showed significant functional recovery in the open field, in the horizontal ladder and in CatWalk locomotor tasks. We conclude that the fibrous lesion scar plays a pivotal role as a growth barrier for regenerating axons in adult spinal cord and that a delay in fibrotic scarring by local inhibition of collagen biosynthesis and basement membrane deposition is a promising and unique therapeutic strategy for treating human spinal trauma.","iron"

MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow by their adherence to plastic, labeled with iron-oxide nanoparticles and expanded in vitro. Seven days after injury, rats received an intravenous injection of MSCs or BMCs or a subcutaneous injection of GCSF (from day 7 to 11 post-injury). Functional status was assessed weekly for 5 weeks after SCI, using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan (BBB) locomotor rating score and the plantar test. Animals with SCI treated with MSCs, BMCs, or G-CSF had higher BBB scores and better recovery of hind limb sensitivity than controls injected with saline. Morphometric measurements showed an increase in the spared white matter. MR images of the spinal cords were taken ex vivo 5 weeks after SCI using a Bruker 4.7-T spectrometer. The lesions populated by grafted MSCs appeared as dark hypointense areas. Histology confirmed a large number of iron-containing and PKH 26-positive cells in the lesion site. We conclude that treatment with three different bone marrow cell populations had a positive effect on behavioral outcome and histopathological assessment after SCI, which was most pronounced after MSC injection.","iron"

Although phagocytosis of myelin in vitro promotes M2 polarization, macrophage/ microglia in the injured spinal cord retain a predominantly M1 state that is detrimental to recovery. We have identified two factors that underlie this skewing toward M1 polarization in the injured CNS. We show that TNF prevents phagocytosis-mediated conversion from M1 to M2 cells in vitro and in vivo in spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, iron that accumulates in macrophages in SCI increases TNF expression and the appearance of a macrophage population with a proinflammatory mixed M1/M2 phenotype. In addition, transplantation experiments show that increased loading of M2 macrophages with iron induces a rapid switch from M2 to M1 phenotype. The combined effect of this favors predominant and prolonged M1 macrophage polarization that is detrimental to recovery after SCI.","iron"

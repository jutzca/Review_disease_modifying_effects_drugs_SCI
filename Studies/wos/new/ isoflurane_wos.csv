Accidents involving this porcupine and dogs have become usual in some cities of Brazil. Dog bites may eventually result in spinal injuries. When there is clinical evidence of spinal cord injury, a myelography under general anesthesia may be required to allow identification of the exact location of the injury. To the authors' knowledge, there is only one case report about anesthesia in Sphiggurus villosus where dissociative anesthesia was employed. This paper describes one case report of inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane in a Sphiggurus villosus undergoing myelography.","isoflurane"

However, most general anesthetics, such as isoflurane, are known to suppress SEPs, which might affect the interpretation of the signals. In animal studies, the usage of anesthetics during SEP measurements is inevitable due to which detailed effect of these drugs on the recordings should be known. In this paper, the effect of isoflurane on SEPs was studied in a rat model. Both time and frequency properties of the cortical recordings generated by stimulating the tibial nerve of rat's hindlimb were investigated at three different isoflurane levels. While the anesthetic agent is shown to generally suppress the amplitude of the SEP, the effect was found to be nonlinear influencing more substantially the latter part of waveform. This finding will potentially help us in future work aiming at separating the effects of anesthetics on SEP from those due to injury in the ascending neural pathways.","isoflurane"

Adult rats were implanted with various sizes of hygroscopic plastic material at the T12 spinal level to determine the dimensions that would produce a progressive neurologic deficit from which recovery could occur. Neurologic evaluation was conducted on an inclined plane, noting the maximum angle at which an animal was able to maintain orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal midline. Scores were statistically modeled for each group to develop profiles of neurologic deficits. Rats were subjected to a 4-h exposure to isoflurane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or ketamine 7 or 8 days postimplantation. Neurologic outcomes were compared to a SCI reference group which received no postimplant anesthesia. An animal weight/desiccated implant volume (W-a/V-i) ratio of 53 to 73 g/mm(3) produced postimplant neurologic deficits which deteriorated to near maximum within 3 days, followed by a gradual improvement beginning at Day 8 and returning to near normal between 22 and 25 days. Final outcome was based on modeled ramp scores for each group and reported in degrees +/- SD: reference, 71.2 +/- 1.1; fentanyl/N2O, 70.4 +/- 0.3; isoflurane, 72.6 +/- 1.1; and ketamine, 64.9 +/- 0.6.

Transient blockage of the CD11d/CD18 integrin has been reported to reduce secondary neuronal damage as well as to improve functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment with an anti-CD11d monoclonal antibody (mAb) would improve motor performance, reduce pain and histopathological damage in animals following clip-compression injury as reported. Adult male Wistar rats (250 g) were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the T12 spinal cord exposed by T10 and T11 dorsal laminectomies followed by a 60 s period of clip compression utilizing a 35 g clip. Control animals received an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody (1B7) while the treated group received the anti-CD11d mAb (217 L; 1.0 mg/kg) systemically. Open-field locomotion and sensory function were assessed and animals were perfusion-fixed at twelve weeks after injury for quantitative histopathological analysis. As compared to 1B7, 217 L treated animals showed an overall non-significant trend to better motor recovery. All animals showed chronic mechanical allodynia and anti-CD11d mAb treatment did not significantly prevent its development. Histopathological analysis demonstrated severe injury to gray and white matter after compression with a non-significant trend in anti-CD11d protection compared to control animals for preserved myelin. Although positive effects with the anti-CD11d mAb treatment have been reported after compressive SCI, it is suggested that this potential treatment requires further investigation before clinical trials in spinal cord injured patients are implemented.

However, most previous studies were performed under anesthesia, which significantly alters respiratory network. Therefore, the goal of this work was to assess spontaneous diaphragm recovery post-C2Hx in awake, freely behaving animals. Adult rats were chronically implanted with diaphragm EMG electrodes and recorded during 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Our results reveal that ipsilateral diaphragm activity partially recovers within days post-injury and reaches pre-injury amplitude in a few weeks. However, the full extent of spontaneous ipsilateral recovery is significantly attenuated by anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane). This suggests that the observed recovery may be attributed in part to activation of NMDA receptors which are suppressed by anesthesia. Despite spontaneous recovery in awake animals, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm dysfunction still persists: i) Inspiratory bursts during basal (slow) breathing exhibit an altered pattern, ii) the amplitude of sighs or augmented breaths is significantly decreased, and iii) the injured hemidiaphragm exhibits spontaneous events of hyperexcitation. The results from this study offer an under appreciated insight into spontaneous diaphragm activity and recovery following high cervical spinal cord injury in awake animals.","isoflurane"

The exact pathogenic mechanism leading to its development is still unclear. We introduce a new hypothesis that high levels of anesthesia might protect the organism against the development of neurogenic pulmonary edema due to a more pronounced inhibition of the hypothalamic, brainstem and spinal vasoactive sympathetic centers. On the basis of a more pronounced neuronal inhibition of the vasoactive centers, a severe sympathetic discharge does not occur and neurogenic pulmonary edema does not develop. In contrast, an insufficient anesthesia level is not able to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system during an injury of the central nervous system and thus neurogenic pulmonary edema develops. During experiments with central nervous system injury, low-anesthesia-induced neurogenic pulmonary edema might negatively influence the overall recovery of the animal. More importantly, during a neurosurgical intervention, insufficient anesthesia might similarly lead to neurogenic pulmonary edema development in operated patients. Our hypothesis indicates the necessity of precisely monitoring of the level anesthesia during experimental manipulations of the central nervous system in animals or neurosurgical interventions in humans.

This is the first study to show how two commonly used anesthetics affect continuously recorded hemodynamic parameters and locomotor recovery during a 2-week period after two levels of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We hypothesized that the level of cardiovascular depression and recovery of locomotor function would be dependent upon the anesthetic used during SCI. Thirty-two adult female rats were subjected to a sham, 25-mm or 50-mm SCI at T3-4 under pentobarbital or isoflurane anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were telemetrically recorded before, during, and after SCI. Locomotor function recovered best in the 25-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. There was no significant difference in locomotor recovery between the 25-mm-injured pentobarbital-anesthetized animals and the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. White matter sparing and extent of intermediolateral cell column loss appeared larger in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, but this was not significant. There were no differential effects of anesthetics on HR and MAP before SCI, but recovery from anesthesia was significantly slower in pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. At the time of SCI, MAP was acutely elevated in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, whereas MAP decreased in the isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Hypotension occurred in the pentobarbital-anesthetized groups and in the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized group. In pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, SCI resulted in acute elevation of HR, although HR remained low. Return of HR to baseline was much slower in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. Severe SCI at T3 produced significant chronic tachycardia that was injury severity dependent. Although some laboratories monitor blood pressure, HR, and other physiological variables during surgery for SCI, inherently few have monitored cardiovascular function during recovery. This study shows that anesthetics affect hemodynamic parameters differently, which in turn can affect functional outcome measures. This supports the need for a careful evaluation of cardiovascular and other physiological measures in experimental models of SCI. Choice of anesthetic should be an important consideration in experimental designs and data analyses.","isoflurane"

Spinal transections were performed under isoflurane anesthesia 1-8 weeks prior to the terminal experiment. Four major differences between intact and transected rats were observed: 1) While the frequency of micturition events in the intact rat was dependent upon the rate of bladder filling, the bladder contraction and associated EUS activation in transected rats exhibited an intrinsic rhythm that was independent of the rate of bladder filling and post-transection survival time. 2) EUS activation was augmented at the beginning of active bladder contraction in the transected rat, indicating an amplified guarding reflex. 3) Phasic EUS activity at the peak of bladder contraction (EUS bursting) in the intact rat was markedly reduced or absent in the transected rat. 4) The sustained tonic EUS activity following bladder relaxation in the intact rat was absent in the transected rat.

In all cases, increased phrenic burst amplitude was observed following restoration of respiratory neural activity (hypocapnia: 92+/-22%; isoflurane: 65+/-22%; HFV: 54+/-13% baseline), which was significantly greater than time controls receiving the same surgery, but no interruptions in respiratory neural activity (3+/-5% baseline, p < 0.05).

Here, we use a simple outcome measure (volume of retained urine) to assess bladder dysfunction over time following moderate contusion injuries at 3 different thoracic levels (T1. T4, or T9) and complete crush injuries (T1 vs. T9). The volume of urine retained in the bladder was measured daily for fourteen days post injury by anesthetizing the animals with isoflurane, expressing the bladder, and weighing the urine. To compare bladder deficits with the degree of impairment of hindlimb motor function, locomotion was assessed using the BBB open field rating scale. Rats with contusions at T4 and T9 exhibited bladder impairments reflected by increased urine retention from 1 to 12 days post injury. In contrast, rats with contusions at T1 exhibited minimal deficits (smaller volumes of retained urine). Lesion size and overall functional impairment were comparable between groups based on quantitative assessments of lesion area at the epicenter and BBB locomotor scores. Moreover, a sector analysis of sparing of different portions of the white matter revealed no differences in sparing of different funiculi between the groups. Injections of Fluorogold into lumbar segments led to retrograde labeling of a larger number of neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC) following T1 injury when compared to T4 or T9.

The spinal cord was examined using MRI and morphometry of the spared white and gray matter. All animals from the 1.5% and 2% groups developed NPE. Almost 42% of the animals in the 1.5% group died of severe pulmonary hemorrhage and suffocation; x-rays, the pulmonary index, and the histological picture revealed a massive NPE. More than 71% of the animals from the 2.5% and 3% groups did not develop any signs of NPE. Blood pressure after spinal cord compression rose more in the 1.5% group than in the 3% one.

Intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) is a promising method for reanimating paralyzed limbs following neurological injury. ISMS within the cervical and lumbar spinal cord is capable of evoking a variety of highly-functional movements prior to injury, but the ability of ISMS to evoke forelimb movements after cervical spinal cord injury is unknown. Here we examine the forelimb movements and muscles activated by cervical ISMS both before and after contusion injury. Approach. We documented the forelimb muscles activated and movements evoked via systematic stimulation of the rodent cervical spinal cord both before injury and three, six and nine weeks following a moderate C4/C5 lateralized contusion injury. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane to permit construction of somatotopic maps of evoked movements and quantify evoked muscle synergies between cervical segments C3 and T1. Main results. When ISMS was delivered to the cervical spinal cord, a variety of responses were observed at 68% of locations tested, with a spatial distribution that generally corresponded to the location of motor neuron pools. Stimulus currents required to achieve movement and the number of sites where movements could be evoked were unchanged by spinal cord injury. A transient shift toward extension-dominated movements and restricted muscle synergies were observed at three and six weeks following injury, respectively. By nine weeks after injury, however, ISMS-evoked patterns were similar to spinally-intact animals. Significance. The results demonstrate the potential for cervical ISMS to reanimate hand and arm function following spinal cord injury. Robust forelimb movements can be evoked both before and during the chronic stages of recovery from a clinically relevant and sustained cervical contusion injury.","isoflurane"

Lesion volume showed no significant differences between K0 and WT mice at 24 h. RT-PCR indicated that K0 mice had significantly less Bcl-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 mRNA compared with WT controls. Western blot also showed that K0 had significantly less Bcl-2 7 d after spinal cord injury. K0 mice had significantly worse BMS locomotor scores than WT at 6 weeks. K0 mice also had a significantly reduced area of spared white matter and fewer neuronal-specific nuclear protein-positive neurons in the spinal cord surrounding the impact site. This result supports a potential neuroprotective role for OPN in the inflammatory response to spinal cord injury.","isoflurane"

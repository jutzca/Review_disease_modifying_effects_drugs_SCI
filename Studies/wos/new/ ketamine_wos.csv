Materials and Methods: Adult female Albino Wistar rats were anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and T10 laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord, before drop-weight injury. Following injury, 2 mu g of aFGF was administered at the site of injury and cultured rat olfactory mucosal OEC were transplanted as a single dose of 1 x 106 cells on the 9th day after SCI, used individually as well as in combination therapy. The outcome of the treatments was assessed using the hind-limb motor recovery-Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scale, transcranial motor-evoked potential, and histological studies. Results: All the treated groups showed improvement in hind-limb motor recovery when compared to the control group in BBB (P < 0.05). There was increased electromyography amplitude in treated rats as compared to controls (P < 0.05). Retrograde and anterograde tract tracing showed an increase of preserved axons and possible regeneration. Combination of aFGF with OEC transplantation demonstrated more beneficial effects following SCI than with individual therapy. Conclusion: aFGF and OEC transplantation have neuroprotective and regenerative therapeutic potentials for the future clinical application.","ketamine"

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diaphragm EMG activity during lower-force behaviors, such as eupnea and hypoxia-hypercapnia, is differentially affected compared with higher-force behaviors, such as a sigh. in lightly anesthetized animals. In adult male rats, chronically implanted diaphragm EMG electrodes were used to measure the effects of low-dose ketamine (30 mg/kg) and xylazine (3 mg/kg) on root mean square (RMS) EMG amplitude across a range of motor behaviors. A mixed linear model was used to evaluate the effects of ketamine-xylazine anesthesia on peak RMS EMG and ventilatory parameters, with condition (awake vs. anesthetized), behavior (eupnea, hypoxia-hypercapnia, sigh), side (left or right hemidiaphragm), and their interactions as fixed effects and animal as a random effect. Compared with the awake recordings. there was an overall reduction of peak diaphragm RMS EMG across behaviors during anesthesia, but this reduction was more pronounced during spontaneous sighs (which require similar to 60% of maximal diaphragm force). Respiratory rates and duty cycle during eupnea and hypoxiahypercapnia were higher in awake compared with anesthetized conditions. These results highlight the importance of identifying anesthetic effects on a range of respiratory motor behaviors, including sighs necessary for maintaining airway patency.","ketamine"

Adult rats were implanted with various sizes of hygroscopic plastic material at the T12 spinal level to determine the dimensions that would produce a progressive neurologic deficit from which recovery could occur. Neurologic evaluation was conducted on an inclined plane, noting the maximum angle at which an animal was able to maintain orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal midline. Scores were statistically modeled for each group to develop profiles of neurologic deficits. Rats were subjected to a 4-h exposure to isoflurane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or ketamine 7 or 8 days postimplantation. Neurologic outcomes were compared to a SCI reference group which received no postimplant anesthesia. An animal weight/desiccated implant volume (W-a/V-i) ratio of 53 to 73 g/mm(3) produced postimplant neurologic deficits which deteriorated to near maximum within 3 days, followed by a gradual improvement beginning at Day 8 and returning to near normal between 22 and 25 days. Final outcome was based on modeled ramp scores for each group and reported in degrees +/- SD: reference, 71.2 +/- 1.1; fentanyl/N2O, 70.4 +/- 0.3; isoflurane, 72.6 +/- 1.1; and ketamine, 64.9 +/- 0.6. The fentanyl group attained maximum recovery first (P > 0.05) but did not recover to a level different on the average from the reference group. The ketamine group demonstrated a poorer (P > 0.05) recovery level relative to the other anesthetic protocols.","ketamine"

However, most previous studies were performed under anesthesia, which significantly alters respiratory network. Therefore, the goal of this work was to assess spontaneous diaphragm recovery post-C2Hx in awake, freely behaving animals. Adult rats were chronically implanted with diaphragm EMG electrodes and recorded during 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Our results reveal that ipsilateral diaphragm activity partially recovers within days post-injury and reaches pre-injury amplitude in a few weeks. However, the full extent of spontaneous ipsilateral recovery is significantly attenuated by anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane). This suggests that the observed recovery may be attributed in part to activation of NMDA receptors which are suppressed by anesthesia. Despite spontaneous recovery in awake animals, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm dysfunction still persists: i) Inspiratory bursts during basal (slow) breathing exhibit an altered pattern, ii) the amplitude of sighs or augmented breaths is significantly decreased, and iii) the injured hemidiaphragm exhibits spontaneous events of hyperexcitation. The results from this study offer an under appreciated insight into spontaneous diaphragm activity and recovery following high cervical spinal cord injury in awake animals.","ketamine"

The present study investigated whether spinal GABA-A and/or glycine receptors are involved in the inhibition of the crossed phrenic pathways after a C2 spinal cord hemisection injury. Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, adult, female, Sprague-Dawley rats were hemisected at the C2 spinal cord level. Following 1 week post injury, rats were anesthetized with urethane, vagotornized, paralyzed and ventilated. GABA-A receptor (bicuculline and Gabazine) and glycine receptor (strychnine) antagonists were applied directly to the cervical spinal cord (C3-C7), while bilateral phrenic nerve motor output was recorded. GABA-A receptor antagonists significantly increased peak phrenic amplitude bilaterally and induced crossed phrenic activity in spinal-injured rats. Muscimol, a specific GABA-A receptor agonist, blocked these effects. Glycine receptor antagonists applied directly to the spinal cord had no significant effect on phrenic motor output. These results indicate that phrenic motor neurons are inhibited via a GABA-A mediated receptor mechanism located within the spinal cord to inhibit the expression of crossed phrenic pathways.

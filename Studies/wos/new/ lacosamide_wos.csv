However, there remains a great deal of controversy regarding the optimal agent. Studies associating the prophylactic use of AED's with poor outcomes are heavily biased by the prevalent use of phenytoin, an agent highly associated with deleterious effects. In the current study, we evaluate lacosamide for neuroprotective properties in a murine model of closed head injury.","lacosamide"

Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC50 of 2 mu M. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 mu M BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K-d = 170 mu M) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K-d = 5 mu M) and even more tightly Downloaded from molpharm. aspetjournals. org at Thomson Scientific on July 15, 2011 (K-d = 0.2 mu M) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 mu M. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels.","lacosamide"

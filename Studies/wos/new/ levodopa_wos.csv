Levodopa (L-Dopa), the current main treatment for PD, reduces PD symptoms by partially replacing dopamine, but it does not slow neurodegeneration. Recent studies have evidenced that neuroinflammatory processes contribute to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc under cytopathic conditions, while other lines of inquiry have implicated phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) as a causal factor in axonal retraction after neural injury. We recently reported on the therapeutic effect of lanthionine ketimine ester (LKE) which associates with CRMP2 following axonal injury in the spinal cord.","levodopa"

The strong link between dopamine and motor learning has been well-established in the animal literature with similar findings reported in healthy adults and the elderly. Objective. We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. Methods. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. Results. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. Conclusions. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.","levodopa"

A low-dose of L-Dopa per day is known to enhance the effects of physical training after stroke. This is tested here in subjects suffering a SCI. Twelve subacute, incomplete SCI (iSCI) subjects (ASIA C and D) were randomized in a trial with a double-blind, crossover design to receive 6 weeks of L-Dopa (200 mg), followed by 6 weeks of placebo, or vice versa. Outcome measures were ASIA Motor-Score (AMS) reflecting motor recovery; walking ability, assessed by the Walking Index of Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI); and Activities of Daily Living (ADL), as monitored by the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). Both placebo and L-Dopa, in combination with physiotherapy, produced a significant motor recovery after SCI. The combination of L-Dopa and physiotherapy had no greater effect on the outcome than placebo and physiotherapy. The possible reasons for the different effect of L-Dopa in stroke and iSCI subjects are discussed.","levodopa"

Decay of this protein is essential for neuronal maintenance and recovery. Levodopa elevates oxidative stress. Therefore levodopa may impact repulsive guidance molecule A metabolism. Objectives were to investigate plasma concentrations of repulsive guidance molecule A, levodopa, cysteine and cysteinyl-glycine before and 1 h after levodopa application in patients with Parkinson's disease. Cysteine and cysteinyl-glycine as biomarkers for oxidative stress exposure decreased, repulsive guidance molecule A and levodopa rose. Repulsive guidance molecule A remained unchanged in levodopa na < ve patients, but particularly went up in patients on a prior chronic levodopa regimen. Decay of cysteine specifically cysteinyl-glycine results from an elevated glutathione generation with rising cysteine consumption respectively from the alternative glutathione transformation to its oxidized form glutathione disulfide after free radical scavenging. Repulsive guidance molecule A rise may inhibit physiologic mechanisms for neuronal survival.","levodopa"

However, as the disease progresses, the therapeutic response to L-DOPA gradually becomes erratic and is associated with the emergence of dyskinesia in the majority of patients. The pathogenesis of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is still unknown. In the current study, using the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of PD, we demonstrated that the calcium-dependent proteins calpains and cdk5 of the striatum play a critical role in the behavioral and molecular changes evoked by L-DOPA therapy. We first confirmed that L-DOPA reversed PD symptoms, assessed by the cylinder, stepping and vibrissae-elicited reaching tests in this animal model, and elicited robust abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) reminiscent of LID. Interestingly, intrastriatal infusion of the calpains inhibitor MDL28170, and to a lower extent the cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine, reduced the severity and amplitude of AlMs without affecting L-DOPA's antiparkinsonian effects. Notably, the calpains and cdk5 inhibitors totally reversed the striatal molecular changes attributed to L-DOPA therapy, such as ERK1/2 and dynamin phosphorylation. Another fascinating observation was that L-DOPA therapy, in combination with intrastriatal infusion of MDL28170, augmented tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the striatum of lesioned rats without affecting the number of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. These findings disclose a novel mechanism underlying the maladaptive alterations induced by L-DOPA therapy in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","levodopa"

We conducted proof-of-concept experiments aimed at assessing efficacy upon oral administration of a novel combination therapy for central pattern generator (CPG) activation and corresponding locomotor movement generation in completely paraplegic animals. Co-administration orally (by gavage) of buspirone, levodopa and carbidopa was found to dose-dependently induce episodes of steady weight-bearing stepping in low-thoracic (Th9/10) spinal cord-transected (Tx) mice (with no other form of assistance or training). Robust hindlimb stepping with weight-bearing capabilities was induced with the tri-therapy but not with clinically relevant doses of these compounds administered separately. These results provide evidence suggesting that this drug combination may be ideally suited to constitute a first-in-class therapy (CPG activator) for locomotor activity induction in chronic SCI individuals, given that efficacy was shown using commercially available brain-permeable small molecules, already known as safe for the treatment of various neurological indications.","levodopa"

The ambitious goal of these studies was no less than a molecular and cellular ""cure"" for Parkinson's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, and spinal cord injury. Much research has been done in rodents, and a few studies have been done in nonhuman primate models. Early uncontrolled clinical reports were enthusiastic, but the outcome of the first randomized, double blind, controlled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure Parkinson's disease, although there were some significant positive findings. Were the earlier animal studies and clinical reports wrong? Should we give up on the goal? Some aspects of the trial design and implantation methods may have led to lack of effects and to some side effects such as dyskinesias. But a detailed review of clinical neural transplants published to date still suggests that neural transplantation variably reverses some aspects of Parkinson's disease, although differing methods make exact comparisons difficult. While the randomized clinical studies have been in progress, new methods have shown promise for increasing transplant survival and distribution, reconstructing the circuits to provide dopamine to the appropriate targets and with normal regulation. Selected promising new strategies are reviewed that block apoptosis induced by tissue dissection, promote vascularization of grafts, reduce oxidant stress, provide key growth factors, and counteract adverse effects of increased age. New sources of replacement cells and stem cells may provide additional advantages for the future. Full recovery from parkinsonism appears not only to be possible, but a reliable cell replacement treatment may finally be near.","levodopa"

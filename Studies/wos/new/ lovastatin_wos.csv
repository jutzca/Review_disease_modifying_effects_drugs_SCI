Atorvastatin has been shown to be neuroprotective after transient ischaemia or traumatic injury. The aim of this study was to establish if systemic administration of Atorvastatin could improve functional muscle reinnervation after complete sciatic nerve section. Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. After a complete right sciatic nerve section, end-to-end microsuture repair was performed and fibrin glue was added. Three groups were studied: (1) sutures (S) + fibrin glue (F) only + saline administration for 14 days; (2) S+F+Atorvastatin administration for 14 days; and (3) uninjured nerve. Five months later, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle were isolated to perform in vivo electrophysiological measurements. Better kinematics was observed in atorvastatin-treated rats 5 months after its administration. Indeed, a larger excursion of the hip-ankle-toe angle during walking was observed. This effect was associated with the preservation of electromyographic activity (2.91 mV vs 0.77 mV) and maximal muscle force (85.1 g vs 28.6 g) on stimulation of the proximal nerve section. Five months after a neurotmetic lesion, the recovery is incomplete when using suture and fibrin glue only. Furthermore, the systemic administration of Atorvastatin for 14 days after lesion was beneficial in improving locomotion capability associated with the re-establishment of muscle strength and EMG activity.","lovastatin"

Any agents that limit the spread of neural tissue damage may enhance the nerve regeneration. In this regard, statins have been shown to have neuroprotective properties. We investigated the effects of Lovastatin against sciatic nerve crush injury in male Wistar Rats. Lovastatin or vehicle was given parenteraly to rats for 7 days postoperative. In Lovastatin treatment groups, a single dose of agent (2 and 5 mg/kg) was administered daily. The control group was given vehicle in the same manner. The rats were subjected to crush injury in the left sciatic nerve with non-serrated clamp for 30 s. Behavioral, electrophysiological and morphological alterations were evaluated during the experimental period. Results showed that Lovastatin in a dose of 5 mg/kg could significantly (P < 0.05) accelerate regeneration process and functional recovery. Also results demonstrated that morphometric parameters such as mean axonal number and myelin thickness were significantly higher in Lovastatin (5 mg/kg) treatment groups compared to controls (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that a short-term course treatment with Lovastatin can protect against sciatic nerve injury. Findings indicate that postoperative administration of Lovastatin led to accelerate regeneration process and motor function recovery in nerve crush model in rats. This effect might be due to the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory or anti-oxidative properties of Lovastatin. It is clear that more research is needed to confirm these findings.","lovastatin"

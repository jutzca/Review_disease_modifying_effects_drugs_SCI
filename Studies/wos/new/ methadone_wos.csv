Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based practice designed initially for adults with mental illness. Although the evidence for using IPS with individuals with severe mental illness is well documented, less is known about the efficacy of using IPS with consumers with substance use disorders, and the results have yet to be systematically evaluated and organized. Key components of zero exclusion, rapid competitive job search, and incorporation with treatment services as well as benefits are components that make IPS a strong practice to incorporate into substance abuse treatment. This study aims to evaluate and organize the evidence base of using IPS with adults with substance use disorders. Results: A systematic review was conducted of meta-analyses, reviews, and individual studies from 2000 through 2019, measuring the efficacy of IPS with individuals with SUD or comorbid SUD. Databases searched were Scopus, PubMed, and PsychInfo. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies are reviewed and critiqued for their application to a SUD population. Then, barriers and facilitators of IPS implementation with this population are discussed. Conclusions/Importance: There is a high evidence to support to application of IPS for persons with SUD, both singly and when combined with a mental health disorder. Barriers to IPS implementation including episodic treatment, risk of relapse, and housing or criminal justice instability make the IPS program a useful best practice to consider for this population.","methadone"

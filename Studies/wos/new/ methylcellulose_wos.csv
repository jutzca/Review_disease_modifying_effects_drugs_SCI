Recovery and treatment of SCI is critical challenges for medicine, to overcome the hurdles stem cells and hydrogel scaffolds implantation is a boon for SCI recovery. In this regard, we reported the synthesis of Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) loaded Agarose/Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) as promising materials for SCI treatment. Herein, Au NPs was synthesized by well-established citrate reduction method and the prepared materials were characterised by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and EDAX analysis. The microscopic images showed an elliptical or ovoid porous structure nature of hydrogel, and successful and homogenous loading of photo plasmonic nanoparticles into the hydrogel structure. The in vitro cell viability and inflammation analyses data exhibited that prepared hydrogels have no toxic to the cells and displayed high antiregenerative ability with bone marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages cells. The in vivo analysis study demonstrated that the treated materials with encapsulated MSCs have greater nerve tissue regeneration efficacy which was confirmed by the results of BBB scores. The hind limb locomotion of treated model animals was totally vanished after post-operational surgery. It's established that implanted nano-hydrogel materials combined with MSCs have quicker recovery of motor function after post-operative surgery, when compared to the other implanted animal groups.","methylcellulose"

Our goal was to improve grafted cell survival in the injured spinal cord, which is typically low. Cells were grafted in hyaluronan-methylcellulose hydrogel (HAMC) or hyaluronan-methylcellulose modified with laminin-and fibronectin-derived peptide sequences (eHAMC). The criteria for selection of hyaluronan was for its shear-thinning properties, making the hydrogel easy to inject, methylcellulose for its inverse thermal gelation, helping to keep grafted cells in situ, and fibronectin and laminin to improve cell attachment and, thus, prevent cell death due to dissociation from substrate molecules (i.e., anoikis). Post-mortem examination revealed large masses of GFP(+) SKP-SCs in the spinal cords of rats that received cells in HAMC (5 out of n = 8) and eHAMC (6 out of n = 8). Cell transplantation in eHAMC caused significantly greater spinal lesions compared to lesion and eHAMC only control groups. A parallel study showed similar masses in the contused spinal cord of rats after transplantation of adult GFP(+) SKP-SCs without a hydrogel or immunosuppression. These findings suggest that adult GFP(+) SKP-SCs, cultured/transplanted under the conditions described here, have a capacity for uncontrolled proliferation.

ChABC was delivered to the injured spinal cord at the site of injury by affinity release from a crosslinked methylcellulose (MC) hydrogel by injection into the intrathecal space. NESCs were distributed in a hydrogel comprised of hyaluronan and MC and injected into the spinal cord tissue both rostral and caudal to the site of injury. Cell transplantation led to reduced cavity formation, but did not improve motor function. While few surviving cells were found 2 weeks post injury, the majority of live cells were neurons, with only few astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and progenitor cells. At 9 weeks post injury, there were more progenitor cells and a more even distribution of cell types compared to those at 2 weeks post injury, suggesting preferential survival and differentiation. Interestingly, animals that received cells and chABC had more neurons than animals that received cells alone, suggesting that chABC influenced the injury environment such that neuronal differentiation or survival was favoured.","methylcellulose"

Moreover, addition of fibrinogen was used to enhance proliferation of human Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) on HA-PH-RGD hydrogel. The neuroregenerative potential of HA-PH-RGD hydrogel was evaluated in vivo in acute and subacute models of SCI. Both HA-PH-RGD hydrogel injection and implantation into the acute spinal cord hemisection cavity resulted in the same axonal and blood vessel density in the lesion area after 2 and 8 weeks. HA-PH-RGD hydrogel alone or combined with fibrinogen (HA-PH-RGD/F) and seeded with hWJ-MSCs was then injected into subacute SCI and evaluated after 8 weeks using behavioural, histological and gene expression analysis. A subacute injection of both HA-PH-RGD and HA-PH-RGD/F hydrogels similarly promoted axonal ingrowth into the lesion and this effect was further enhanced when the HA-PH-RGD/F was combined with hWJ-MSCs. On the other hand, no effect was found on locomotor recovery or the blood vessel ingrowth and density of glial scar around the lesion.

To address this issue, we developed a drug delivery system that consists of anti-NogoA-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles dispersed in a hydrogel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (composite HAMC). To optimize in vitro release, we screened formulations for improved anti-NogoA bioactivity and sustained release based on combinations of co-encapsulated trehalose, hyaluronan, MgCO3, and CaCO3. Co-encapsulated MgCO3 and CaCO3 slowed the rate of anti-NogoA release and did not influence anti-NogoA bioactivity. Co-encapsulated trehalose significantly improved anti-NogoA bioactivity at early release time points by stabilizing the protein during lyophilization. Co-encapsulated trehalose with hyaluronan improved bioactivity up to 28d and dramatically increased the rate and duration of sustained delivery. The sustained release of bioactive anti-NogoA from composite HAMC is a compelling formulation for in vivo evaluation in a model of spinal cord injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the complex nature of SCI pathology, a combination treatment strategy will likely be required for success. We hypothesized that tissue and functional repair would be achieved in a rat model of impact-compression SCI by combining degradation of the glial scar, using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), with recruitment of endogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs), using stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF). To test this hypothesis, we designed a crosslinked methylcellulose hydrogel (XMC) for minimally invasive, localized, and sustained intrathecal drug delivery. ChABC was released from XMC using protein-peptide affinity interactions while SDF was delivered by electrostatic affinity interactions from polymeric nanoparticles embedded in XMC. Rats with SCI were treated acutely with a combination of SDF and ChABC, SDF alone, ChABC alone, or vehicle alone, and compared to injury only. Treatment with ChABC, both alone and in combination with SDF, resulted in faster and more sustained behavioural improvement over time than other groups. The significantly reduced chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan levels and greater distribution of NPCs throughout the spinal cord tissue with ChABC delivery, both alone and in combination with SDF, may explain the improved locomotor function. Treatment with SDF alone had no apparent effect on NPC number or distribution nor synergistic effect with ChABC delivery. Thus, in this model of SCI, tissue and functional repair is attributed to ChABC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","methylcellulose"

Using a recombinant human epidermal growth factor, rhEGF, dispersed in collagen, we demonstrated localized release to the injured spinal cord.

ChABC is thermally unstable, further complicating its delivery. Moreover, there are no commercial antibodies available for its detection. To achieve controlled release, we designed an affinity-based system that sustained the release of bioactive ChABC for at least 7 days. ChABC was recombinantly expressed as a fusion protein with Src homology domain 3 (SH3) with an N-terminal histidine (HIS) tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag (ChABC-SH3). Protein purification was achieved using a nickel affinity column and, for the first time, direct quantification of ChABC down to 0.1 nM was attained using an in-house HIS/FLAG double tag ELISA.

Neuroprotective molecules to limit tissue loss are promising; however, intravenous delivery is limited by the blood-spinal cord barrier and short systemic half-life. Current local delivery strategies are flawed: bolus injection results in drug dispersion throughout the intrathecal (IT) space, and catheters/pumps are invasive and open to infection. Our laboratory previously developed a hydrogel of hyaluronan (HA) and methylcellulose (MC) (HAMC) that, when injected into the IT space, was safe and, remarkably, had some therapeutic benefit on its own. In order to test this new paradigm of local and sustained delivery, relative to conventional delivery strategies, we tested, for the first time, the in vivo efficacy of HAMC as an IT drug delivery system by delivering a known neuroprotective molecule, erythropoietin (EPO). In vitro studies showed that EPO was released from HAMC within 16 h, with 80% bioactivity maintained. When the material alone was injected in vivo, individual fluorescent labels on HA and MC showed that HA dissolved from the gel within 24 h, whereas the hydrophobically associated MC persisted in the IT space for 4-7 days. Using a clip compression injury model of moderate severity, HAMC with EPO was injected in the IT space and, in order to better understand the potential of this delivery system, compared to the therapeutic effect of both common delivery strategies-IT EPO and intraperitoneal EPO-and a control of IT HAMC alone. IT HAMC delivery of EPO resulted in both reduced cavitation after SCI and a greater number of neurons relative to the other delivery strategies. These data suggest that the localized and sustained release of EPO at the tissue site by HAMC delivery enhances neuroprotection. This new system of IT delivery holds great promise for the safe, efficacious, and local delivery of therapeutic molecules directly to the spinal cord.","methylcellulose"

The composite hydrogel is well tolerated in the intrathecal space of spinal cord injured rats, showing no increase in inflammation, scarring, or cavity volume relative to controls, and no significant effect on locomotor function up to 28 days. Furthermore, there was no effect on locomotor function in healthy animals which received the composite hydrogel, although a qualitative increase in ED-1 staining was apparent. These data support the further development of composite hydrogels of hyaluronan and methylcellulose containing PLGA nanoparticles for sustained local delivery to the injured spinal cord, an application for which there are no approved alternatives.

Several promising therapies have been identified with the goal of restoring at least some of this lost function and include neuroprotective agents to stop or slow cellular degeneration, neurotrophic factors to stimulate cellular growth, neutralizing molecules to overcome the inhibitory environment at the site of injury, and stem cell transplant strategies to replace lost tissue. The delivery of these therapies to the CNS is a challenge because the blood-brain barrier limits the diffusion of molecules into the brain by traditional oral or intravenous routes. Injectable hydrogels have the capacity to overcome the challenges associated with drug delivery to the CNS, by providing a minimally invasive, localized, void-filling platform for therapeutic use. Small molecule or protein drugs can be distributed throughout the hydrogel which then acts as a depot for their sustained release at the injury site. For cell delivery, the hydrogel can reduce cell aggregation and provide an adhesive matrix for improved cell survival and integration. Additionally, by choosing a biodegradable or bioresorbable hydrogel material, the system will eventually be eliminated from the body. This review discusses both natural and synthetic injectable hydrogel materials that have been used for drug or cell delivery to the CNS including hyaluronan, methylcellulose, chitosan, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and Matrigel.","methylcellulose"

Our goal was to improve the number and type of regenerated axons within the spinal cord through the addition of different matrices and growth factors incorporated within the lumen of the channel. After complete spinal cord transection at T8, pHEMA-MMA channels, having an elastic modulus of 263 +/- 13 kPa were implanted into adult Sprague Dawley rats. The channels were then filled with one of the following matrices: collagen, fibrin, Matrigel (TM), methylcellulose, or smaller pHEMA-MMA tubes placed within a larger pHEMA-MMA channel (called tubes within channels, TWC). We also supplemented selected matrices (collagen and fibrin) with neurotrophic factors, fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). After channel implantation, fibrin glue was applied to the cord-channel interface, and a duraplasty was performed with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE (R)) membrane. Controls included animals that had either complete spinal cord transection and implantation of unfilled pHEMA-MMA channels or complete spinal cord transection. Regeneration was assessed by retrograde axonal tracing with Fluoro-Gold, and immunohistochemistry with NF-200 (for total axon counts) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP, for sensory axon counts) after 8 weeks survival. Fibrin, Matrigel (TM), methylcellulose, collagen with FGF-1, collagen with NT-3, fibrin with FGF-1, and fibrin with NT-3 increased the total axon density within the channel (ANOVA,p < 0.05) compared to unfilled channel controls. Only fibrin with FGF-1 decreased the sensory axon density compared to unfilled channel controls (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Fibrin promoted the greatest axonal regeneration from reticular neurons, and methylcellulose promoted the greatest regeneration from vestibular and red nucleus neurons. With Matrige (TM), there was no axonal regeneration from brainstem motor neurons. The addition of FGF-1 increased the axonal regeneration of vestibular neurons, and the addition of NT-3 decreased the total number of axons regenerating from brainstem neurons. The fibrin and TWC showed a consistent improvement in locomotor function at both 7 and 8 weeks. Thus, the present study shows that the presence and type of matrix contained within synthetic hydrogel guidance channels affects the quantity and origin of axons that regenerate after complete spinal cord transection, and can improve functional recovery. Determining the optimum matrices and growth factors for insertion into these guidance channels will improve regeneration of the injured spinal cord. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel drug delivery system (DDS) is being developed in our laboratory that can provide localized release of growth factors from an injectable gel. The gel must be fast-gelling, non-cell adhesive, degradable, and biocompatible as an injectable intrathecal DDS. A gel that meets these design criteria is a blend of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC). Unlike other injectable gels, HAMC is already at the gelation point prior to injection. It is injectable due to its shear-thinning property, and its get strength increases with temperature. In vivo rat studies show that HAMC is biocompatible within the intrathecal space for 1 month, and may provide therapeutic benefit, in terms of behavior, as measured by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale, and inflammation. These data suggest that HAMC is a promising gel for localized delivery of therapeutic agents to the injured spinal cord. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","methylcellulose"

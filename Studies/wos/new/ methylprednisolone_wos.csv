In partial spinal cord injury, combination of an OEC graft and FK506 reduced functional deficits evaluated by the BBB score, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and H reflex tests, diminished cavitation, astrogliosis and increased sparing/regeneration of raphespinal fibers compared to untreated and single-treatment groups of rats. After complete spinal cord transection, the combined treatment significantly improved functional outcomes, promoted axonal regeneration caudal to the lesion, and diminished astrogliosis compared only to non-transplanted animals. Slightly, but non-signiflcant, better functional and histological results were found in OEC-grafted animals treated with FK506 than in those given saline after spinal cord transection. Nevertheless, the combined treatment increased the percentage of rats that recovered MEPs and promoted a significant reduction in astrogliosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that OEC grafts combined with FK506 promote additive repair of spinal cord injuries to those exerted by single treatments, the effect being more remarkable when the spinal cord is partially lesioned.

Spinal cord injury is a disabling and irreversible condition that has high economic and social costs. There are both primary and secondary mechanisms of damage to the spinal cord. The primary lesion is the mechanical injury itself. The secondary lesion results from one or more biochemical and cellular processes that are triggered by the primary lesion. The frustration of health professionals in treating a severe spinal cord injury was described in 1700 BC in an Egyptian surgical papyrus that was translated by Edwin Smith; the papyrus reported spinal fractures as a ""disease that should not be treated."" Over the last two decades, several studies have been performed to obtain more effective treatments for spinal cord injury. Most of these studies approach a patient with acute spinal cord injury in one of four manners: corrective surgery or a physical, biological or pharmacological treatment method. Science is unraveling the mechanisms of cell protection and neuroregeneration, but clinically, we only provide supportive care for patients with spinal cord injuries. By combining these treatments, researchers attempt to enhance the functional recovery of patients with spinal cord injuries. Advances in the last decade have allowed us to encourage the development of experimental studies in the field of spinal cord regeneration. The combination of several therapeutic strategies should, at minimum, allow for partial functional recoveries for these patients, which could improve their quality of life.","methylprednisolone"

Following the initial traumatic insult, secondary injury mechanisms characterized by persistent heightened inflammation are initiated and lead to continued and pervasive cell death and tissue damage. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as methylprednisolone (MP) used clinically have ambiguous benefits with debilitating side effects. Typically, these drugs are administered systemically at high doses, resulting in toxicity and paradoxically increased inflammation. Furthermore, these drugs have a small time window postinjury (few hours) during which they need to be infused to be effective. As an alternative to MP, we investigated the effect of a small molecule inhibitor (Chicago sky blue, CSB) of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) for treating SCI. The pleiotropic cytokine MIF is known to contribute to upregulation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in various disease and injury states. In vitro, CSB administration alleviated endotoxin-mediated inflammation in primary microglia and macrophages. Nanocarriers such as liposomes can potentially alleviate systemic side effects of high-dose therapy by enabling site-specific drug delivery to the spinal cord. However, the therapeutic window of 100 nm scale nanoparticle localization to the spinal cord after contusion injury is not fully known. Thus, we first investigated the ability of nanocarriers of different sizes to localize to the injured spinal cord up to 2 weeks postinjury. Results from the study showed that nanocarriers as large as 200 nm in diameter could extravasate into the injured spinal cord up to 96 h postinjury. We then formulated nanocarriers (liposomes) encapsulating CSB and administered them intravenously 48 h postinjury, within the previously determined 96 h therapeutic window. In vivo, in this clinically relevant contusion injury model in rats, CSB administration led to preservation of vascular and white matter integrity, improved wound healing, and an increase in levels of arginase and other transcripts indicative of a resolution phase of wound healing. This study demonstrates the potential of MIF inhibition in SCI and the utility of nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery selectively to the injured cord.","methylprednisolone"

SCI patients are at high risk of pressure ulcers, venous thromboembolism, stress ulceration, bowel impaction, dysphagia, and pulmonary complications. Physiatric interventions are needed to prevent these complications. Prognostication of neurologic outcome based on early examination is an important skill to aid in creating a rehabilitation plan and to test for efficacy of early interventions.

A growing body of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological evidence has suggested that oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, working in concert with aberrant calcium fluxes and eicosanoid generation in particular, plays a key role in progressive post-traumatic spinal cord degeneration. Of particular importance, lipid peroxidation has been linked to microvascular damage and hypoperfusion which, if severe enough, can lead to a secondary ischemie insult to the tissue. The ability of intensive dosing with the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone to beneficially affect post-traumatic ischemia and to promote chronic neurologic recovery in spinal cord injured animals has been correlated not with its glucocorticoid activity, but rather with the ability to inhibit post-traumatic spinal lipid peroxidation. In view of this, a novel series of non-glucocorticoid 21-aminosteroids has been developed which lack glucocorticoid activity but are more effective inhibitors of nervous tissue lipid peroxidation than the glucocorticoid steroids. One of these, U74006F, has now been studied in some detail and appears to be a promising new agent for the acute treatment of spinal cord (and brain) trauma. The background and pre-clinical development of this compound to date is reviewed.","methylprednisolone"

The present review briefly summarizes our earlier findings on the therapeutic potential of pharmacological/supraphysiological levels of estrogen in SCI and outlines our ongoing research, highlighting the efficacy of physiological levels of estrogen against neuronal injury, axonal degeneration, and gliosis and also the molecular mechanisms of such neuroprotection in experimental SCI. Furthermore, our ongoing studies designed to explore the different translational potential of estrogen therapy suggest that this multiactive steroid may act as an adjunct therapy to promote angiogenesis, thus enhancing the functional recovery following chronic SCI. Taken together, these studies confirm that estrogen is a potential therapeutic agent for treating SCI.","methylprednisolone"

Cord injury was produced by extradural clip compression through a T-1 laminectomy. Rats were randomized to one of six groups. Group A was given sham laminectomy without cord injury or treatment. The remaining animals were divided into five groups: untreated injury (Group B); injury treated with methylprednisolone (Group C); combined methylprednisolone and 1 mu g bFGF administered locally at the site of injury (Group D); methylprednisolone and 3 mu g bFGF (Group E); or methylprednisolone and 3 mu g heated bFGF (Group F). Groups C through F received treatment 1 hour after cord injury. At 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after surgery, neurological function of hindlimbs was assessed by blinded observers using an established multiple test method (toe spread, reflexes to extension, pain, and pressure as well as inclined plane and swim test) with tests graded and results expressed as a combined behavioral score. Animals were killed to study spinal cord angiogenesis in cord samples (2-mm sections proximal and distal to the injury site) by capillary density determination. Behavioral scores over time showed a significant difference among Groups B, C, D, E, and F (p = 0.0044), with Groups E and B maintaining highest and lowest scores, respectively. There was a linear dose effect of bFGF over time (p = 0.0187). At 4 weeks, scores showed a difference among the five groups (p = 0.006), with Group E showing higher scores than any other treatment group (for example, vs. group F: p = 0.035). There was a significant difference among the groups in gray matter capillary density counts: proximal (p = 0.0192) and distal (p = 0.024), whereas white matter capillary counts were similar across treatment groups. These results show: 1) possible synergism exists between methylprednisolone and bFGF, such that combinations of these drugs significantly enhance neurological recovery, 2) bFGF exhibits a dose-response effect in function but not in capillary density, and 3) heated, inactivated bFGF is not therapeutically effective.","methylprednisolone"

To develop magnesium into a clinically relevant therapy for SCI, further refinement and improvement of the magnesium formulation is necessary. In this series of experiments, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation using an acute model of thoracic SCI. Following thoracic contusion (Infinite Horizon) rat SCI model, we independently confirmed the neuroprotective efficacy of the magnesium and PEG combination which had been previously reported in a thoracic clip compression model of SCI (Ditor et al., 2007). We established that the 254 mu mol/ kg dose of MgCl2 was superior to 127 mu mol/ kg MgCl2 with respect to tissue sparing and locomotor recovery. Additionally, the number of infusions (2, 4, or 6), time between infusions (6 vs 8 hours), and different magnesium salts (MgCl2 vs MgSO4) were evaluated to determine an ""optimal"" treatment regimen. We observed that an ""optimized"" regimen of MgCl2 within PEG conferred greater tissue neuroprotection and improved locomotor recovery compared to methylprednisolone. Further a 4 hour time window of histologic and behavioral efficacy was established. The goal of these experiments was to help guide the treatment parameters for a clinical trial of magnesium within a polyethylene glycol formulation in acute human spinal cord injury.","methylprednisolone"

For this reason, we performed a retrospective study of patients who were operated on after traumatic cervical SCI at the Trauma Center Murnau, Germany, and who met inclusion as well as exclusion criteria (n = 70 patients). Follow-up data were collected prospectively according to the European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI) protocol over a period of 1 year. Early decompression was defined as within the first 8 h after the insult (n = 35 patients). Primary outcome was the difference in the SCIM (Spinal Cord Independence Measure) 1 year after the trauma. After the follow-up period, patients who were decompressed earlier had a significantly higher SCIM difference (45.8 vs. 27.1, p < 0.005). A regression analysis showed that timing of decompression, age, as well as basal AIS (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale) and basal SCIM scores were independent predictors for a better functional outcome (SCIM). Further, patients from the early decompression group had better AIS grades (p < 0.006) and a higher AIS conversion rate (p < 0.029). Additionally, this cohort also had a better total motor performance as well as upper extremity motor function after 1 year (p < 0.025 and p < 0.002).

The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the effects of the use of both methylprednisolone and tadalafil on serum and tissue concentrations of NO, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and tissue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in Wistar albino rats by dropping a 10 g rod from a 5.0 cm height at T8-10. The 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: tadalafil, methylprednisolone, non-treatment and sham groups. Rats were neurologically tested at 24 hours after trauma. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for biochemical evaluation. The tissue level of NO was increased in the tadalafil group compared with the non-treatment and methylprednisolone groups (p < 0.05). The tissue levels of SOD and GSH-Px did not differ between the groups. Serum levels of NO were higher in the tadalafil group than in the non-treatment group (p < 0.05). The increase in serum SOD levels was greater in the tadalafil group than the methylprednisolone group. Serum MDA levels in the tadalafll and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group (p > 0.05). Tissue MDA levels in the taclalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to be lower than in the non-treatment group and sham groups (p > 0.05). Although there was no difference in neurological outcome scores between the taclalafil, methylprednisolone and non-treatment groups (p > 0.05), the animals in the taclalafil and methylprednisolone groups tended to have better Scores than the non-treatment group. Thus, tadalafil appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of injury to the spinal cord by increasing tissue levels of NO and serum activity of SOD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The functional consequences of experimental SCI have been assessed in many ways. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of MPSS vs. saline solution (SS) following moderate T10 contusion injury in rat. Functional recovery was evaluated using the 21-point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor recovery scale, the inclined plane, the beam walk, footprint analysis and the horizontal ladder. To optimize the precision and accuracy of functional results we examined the locomotion on a treadmill using three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Stereology was used to estimate the amount of damaged tissue. The results of the traditional functional methods showed that administration of the NASCIS dosage of MPSS following acute spinal cord contusion did not lead to any significant differences in the functional recovery of MPSS- vs. SS-treated animals. More importantly, the results of the 3D kinematic showed that the MPSS administration did not affect the flexion/extension of the hip, knee and ankle joints during the step cycle. Finally, stereological results revealed no statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups. Altogether, our results support data previously reported by several authors, suggesting that MPSS does not lead to improved functional outcome following experimental acute SCI. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The groups treated with MP, melatonin, and a combination of both had significantly enhanced electrophysiological, biochemical, and neurological recovery and also showed better ultrastructural findings than the trauma and vehicle groups. Although combined treatment was significantly more effective on lipid peroxidation than melatonin or MP treatments alone, at the 10th day, neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural recovery were at the same level. In conclusion, MP, melatonin, and MP and melatonin combined treatment modalities improved functional recovery at the same level. Future studies involving different doses of melatonin and different dose combinations with MP could promise better results since each drug has a different anti-oxidative mechanism of action.","methylprednisolone"

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacologic agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger alpha tocopherol (i.e., vitamin E) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurologic recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for the treatment of acute neural injury. The glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant dosages, improves chronic neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of methylprednisolone is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions. Novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids have been developed that are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than methylprednisolone. One of these, U74006F or tirilazad mesylate, has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials. Compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-aminosteroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) have also recently shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds adds further support to the concept that lipid peroxidation is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacologic neuroprotection.","methylprednisolone"

Neutralization of central nervous system neurite growth inhibitory factors, for example, Nogo-A, is a promising approach to improving recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). In animal SCI models, intrathecal delivery of anti-Nogo-A antibodies promoted regenerative neurite growth and functional recovery. Objective. This first-in-man study assessed the feasibility, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of the human anti-Nogo-A antibody ATI355 following intrathecal administration in patients with acute, complete traumatic paraplegia and tetraplegia. Methods. Patients (N = 52) started treatment 4 to 60 days postinjury. Four consecutive dose-escalation cohorts received 5 to 30 mg/2.5 mL/day continuous intrathecal ATI355 infusion over 24 hours to 28 days. Following pharmacokinetic evaluation, 2 further cohorts received a bolus regimen (6 intrathecal injections of 22.5 and 45 mg/3 mL, respectively, over 4 weeks). Results. ATI355 was well tolerated up to 1-year follow-up. All patients experienced 1 adverse events (AEs). The 581 reported AEs were mostly mild and to be expected following acute SCI. Fifteen patients reported 16 serious AEs, none related to ATI355; one bacterial meningitis case was considered related to intrathecal administration. ATI355 serum levels showed dose-dependency, and intersubject cerebrospinal fluid levels were highly variable after infusion and bolus injection. In 1 paraplegic patient, motor scores improved by 8 points. In tetraplegic patients, mean total motor scores increased, with 3/19 gaining >10 points, and 1/19 27 points at Week 48. Conversion from complete to incomplete SCI occurred in 7/19 patients with tetraplegia. Conclusions.

The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury.

The authors examined the neuroprotective effect of pregabalin (GP) which is known as to reduce glutamate secretion, in a rat model of spinal cord injury. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four groups; the control group (contusion injury only), the methylprednisolone treated group, the minocycline treated group and the GP treated group. Spinal cord injury was produced by contusion using the New York University impactor (25 g-cm, at the 9th-10th thoracic). Functional evaluations were done using the inclined plane test and a motor rating scale. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling staining technique (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining of cord tissues obtained at 7 days post-injury. Pregabalin treated animals showed significantly better functional recovery, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Mean numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the respective groups were 63.5 +/- 7.4, 53.6 +/- 4.0, 44.2 +/- 3.9 and 36.5 +/- 3.6. Double staining (TUNEL and anti-CC1) for oligodendrocyte apoptosis, was used to calculate oligodendrocyte apoptotic indexes (AI), using the following formula AI = (No. of doubly stained cells/No. of anti-CC1 positive cells) x 100. Mean group AIs were 88.6, 46.7, 82.1 and 70.3%, respectively.

This experiment demonstrates that GP can act as a neuroprotector after SCI in rats, and its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects are related to its neuroprotective effect. Further studies are needed to unveil the specific mechanism involved at the receptor level.","methylprednisolone"

Secondary injuries are associated with inflammation, excessive cytokine release, and cell apoptosis. The purine nucleoside guanosine has significant trophic effects and is neuroprotective, antiapoptotic in vitro, and stimulates nerve regeneration. Therefore, we determined whether systemic administration of guanosine could protect rats from some of the secondary effects of spinal cord injury, thereby reducing neurological deficits. Systemic administration of guanosine (8 mg/kg per day, i.p.) for 14 consecutive days, starting 4 h after moderate spinal cord injury in rats, significantly improved not only motor and sensory functions, but also recovery of bladder function. These improvements were associated with reduction in the inflammatory response to injury, reduction of apoptotic cell death, increased sparing of axons, and preservation of myelin. Our data indicate that the therapeutic action of guanosine probably results from reducing inflammation resulting in the protection of axons, oligodendrocytes, and neurons and from inhibiting apoptotic cell death. These data raise the intriguing possibility that guanosine may also be able to reduce secondary pathological events and thus improve functional outcome after traumatic spinal cord injury in humans.","methylprednisolone"

Rats were fed control versus 2% creatine-supplemented chow for 4-5 weeks prior to SCI (pre-fed), after which most resumed a control diet while some remained on a 2% creatine diet (pre & post-fed). Following long-term behavioral analysis (BBB), the amount of spared spinal cord tissue among the dietary regimen groups was assessed using stereology.

Although creatine did not attenuate gray matter loss in the NYU cohort, it significantly spared gray matter in the IH cohort with pre-fed and pre & post-fed regimens. Such selective sparing of injured spinal cord gray matter with a dietary supplement yields a promising strategy to promote neuroprotection after SCI.

Complications include respiratory failure, atelectasis, pneumonia, neurogenic shock, autonomic dysreflexia, venous thromboembolism, and sepsis. While complications may be managed with supportive care, the goal of ameliorating neurologic outcome has proved elusive. Methylprednisolone, when instituted <8 hours after traumatic spinal cord injury, was associated in two clinical trials with statistically significant improvements in motor scores at 6 months and I year; however, critical reappraisal of these data raises questions about their validity and clinical relevance. Until more evidence of clinically effective therapies is available, acute management must be driven by pathophysiologic principles, with emphasis on interventions that attenuate secondary neurologic injury; these include the rational use of immobilization, cautious airway management, and promotion of cord perfusion and oxygenation with the appropriate level of hemodynamic and respiratory support. Clinical trials of pharmacologic neuroprotection have yielded disappointing results, but the ongoing elucidation of spinal cord repair and regenerative mechanisms suggests new therapeutic prospects.","methylprednisolone"

The study discovered 947 total proteins and analyzed 219 and 270 proteins from normal and injured tissue, respectively. After 24 h of traumatic damage induction, the injured spinal cord tissue up-regulated over 39 proteins including neurofilament light chain, annexin 5, heat shock protein, tubulin beta, peripherin, glial fibrillary acidic protein delta, peroxiredoxin 2, and apolipoprotein A. Twenty-one proteins showed reduction. The majority of the modulated proteins belonged to the 13 functional categories.

While the diagnosis of acute traumatic SCI is typically quite easy to make, distinguishing the exact degree of severity and prognosticating the extent of neurologic recovery are challenging. Functional neurologic measures are currently used to stratify injury severity and predict neurologic outcome. However, these measures are often impossible to determine in acutely injured patients. Additionally, for patients deemed to be of a specific injury severity, the variability in spontaneous neurologic recovery is high. Both of these issues severely impair the ability to perform clinical trials in novel therapies for SCI. Biomarkers that could more precisely define the severity of injury and better predict neurologic outcome would be extremely valuable. Furthermore, biological surrogate outcomes measures would be very useful in small preliminary clinical trials of novel therapies if they could inform decisions around the therapeutic regimen for subsequent larger clinical trials.

In the present work we demonstrate a novel 'syndromic' information-processing approach for capitalizing on heterogeneous data from diverse preclinical models of SCI to discover translational outcomes for therapeutic testing. We first built a large, detailed repository of preclinical outcome data from 10 years of basic research on cervical SCI in rats, and then applied multivariate pattern detection techniques to extract features that are conserved across different injury models. We then applied this translational knowledge to derive a data-driven multivariate metric that provides a common 'ruler' for comparisons of outcomes across different types of injury (NYU/MASCIS weight drop injuries, Infinite Horizons (IH) injuries, and hemisection injuries). The findings revealed that each individual endpoint provides a different view of the SCI syndrome, and that considering any single outcome measure in isolation provides a misleading incomplete view of the SCI syndrome This limitation was overcome by taking a novel multivariate integrative approach for leveraging complex data from Preclinical models of neurological disease to identify therapies that target multiple outcomes. We suggest that applying this syndromic approach provides a roadmap for translating therapies for SCI and other complex neurological diseases.","methylprednisolone"

In HK, four patients received four 4-mu l injections (1.6 million cells) into dorsal entry zones above and below the injury site, and another four received 8-mu l injections (3.2 million cells). The eight patients were an average of 13 years after C5-T10 SCI. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging of five patients showed white matter gaps at the injury site before treatment. Two patients had fiber bundles growing across the injury site by 12 months, and the rest had narrower white matter gaps.

KM patients averaged 7 years after C3-T11 SCI and received 3-6 months of intensive locomotor training. Before surgery, only two patients walked 10 m with assistance and did not need assistance for bladder or bowel management before surgery. The rest could not walk or do their bladder and bowel management without assistance.

SCI was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing an aneurysm clip extradurally for 60 s at T10. The rats received treatment with either vehicle (SCI control) or chrysin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) for 28 days. The various behavioral, biochemical and molecular parameters were determined. Chronic treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently (P < 0.05) attenuated the decrease in body weight, urine output, footprint analysis, sperm count and organ weight (testis, seminal vesicle and urinary bladder). It significantly improved (P < 0.05) the nociceptive threshold, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity. The decreased activity of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and membrane-bound inorganic phosphate were significantly (P < 0.05) restored by chrysin treatment. SCI resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in lipid peroxidase, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and bax whereas expression of bcl-2 and caspase-3 were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced. These changes were significantly reduced by treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg, P < 0.05). Histological aberration induced after SCI in spinal cord, testis, kidney and urinary bladder were restored by treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg). In conclusion, chrysin is a potential flavone-possessing antioxidant and its antiapoptotic property caused the subsequent recovery of both motor and sensory functions via modulation of endogenous biomarkers and neuronal apoptosis to inhibit the incidence of neurological deficits due to SCI.","methylprednisolone"

However, there is currently no effective treatment except methylprednisolone, and the use of methylprednisolone has also been questioned due to its moderate efficacy and the drug's downside. Regenerative medicine has remarkably developed since the discovery of stem cells, and many studies have suggested the potential of cell-based therapies for neural injury. Especially, the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord blood cells (hUCB cells) for intractable neurological disorders has been demonstrated using in vitro and vivo models. The hUCB cells are immune na < ve and they are able to differentiate into other phenotypes, including the neural lineage. Their ability to produce several neurotropic factors and to modulate immune and inflammatory reactions has also been noted. Recent evidence has emerged suggesting alternative pathways of graft-mediated neural repair that involve neurotrophic effects. These effects are caused by the release of various growth factors that promote cell survival, angiogenesis and anti-inflammation, and this is all aside from a cell replacement mechanism. In this review, we present the recent findings on the stemness properties and the therapeutic potential of hUCB as a safe, feasible and effective cellular source for transplantation in SCI. These multifaceted protective and restorative effects from hUCB grafts may be interdependent and they act in harmony to promote therapeutic benefits for SCI. Nevertheless, clinical studies with hUCB are still rare because of the concerns about safety and efficiency. Among these concerns, the major histocompatibility in allogeneic transplantation is an important issue to be addressed in future clinical trials for treating SCI.","methylprednisolone"

Animals were subjected to laminectomy and subjected to an extradural 40-g force clip compression for 5 see at T7. Quercetin or saline was administered intraperitoneally 1 h after injury and then every 12 hr thereafter. Recovery of motor function was assessed using BBB scores at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. A dose of 2.5 mumoles quercetin/kg body weight did not result in significantly better functional outcome, whereas doses ranging from 5 to 100 mumoles quercetin/kg body weight resulted in a significantly better functional outcome with half or more of the animals walking, although with deficit; in contrast, no animals walked in the group of saline-treated animals. No significant differences in behavioral outcome were seen amongst the doses ranging from 5 to 100 mumol/kg, nor was there a difference if animals were treated for 4 or 10 days. Therapeutic outcome was coincident with more efficient iron clearance, suggesting that one possible mechanism whereby quercetin decreases secondary damage is through iron chelation.","methylprednisolone"

Group 2 underwent laminectomy followed by SCI. Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and received resveratrol (100 mg/kg), methylprednisolone (MP) (30 mg/kg), resveratrol (100 mg/kg) plus MP (30 mg/kg), and ethanol (2%), respectively.

Chitosan and ferulic acid are strong neuroprotective agents but their systemic delivery is difficult. Our data has shown a prolonged circulation time of the FA-GC nanoparticles allowing for effective delivery of both chitosan and ferulic acid to the injured site. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were found both in the gray matter and white matter. The in vitro tests demonstrated that nanoparticles protected primary neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Using a spinal cord contusion injury model, significant recovery in locomotor function was observed in rats that were intravenously administered nanoparticles at 2 h post injury, as compared to non-improvement by methylprednisolone administration. Histological analysis revealed that FA-GC treatment significantly preserved axons and myelin and also reduced cavity volume, astrogliosis, and inflammatory response at the lesion site.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a key inflammatory mediator that is increasingly expressed after SCI. The effect of TNF-alpha is mediated through its receptors TNFR1 (p55) and TNFR2 (p75). However, whether these two receptors are expressed after SCI has not been demonstrated. In the present study, the temporo-spatial expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 was examined in rats that had received a 10 g impact injury dropped at a height of 12.5 mm using the New York University impact device. In sham operates, no detectable TNFR1 or TNFR2 immunoreactivity (IR) was observed. In contused spinal cord, TNFR1 protein expression and immunoreactivity (IR) were detected as early as 15 min postinjury, reached its peak at 8 h, and declined markedly after 1 and 3 days postinjury. The temporal pattern of TNFR2 expression was similar to that of TNFR1 but its expression peaked at 4 h postinjury. During peak expression, TNFR1- and TNFR2-IR were most intense at the site of injury and decreased gradually from the injury epicenter. TNFR1- and TNFR2-positive cells included neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Methylprednisolone (NIP), a synthetic glucocorticoid, partially inhibited the injury-induced expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2, an effect which could be reversed by RU486, an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptors. We suggest that the expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 after SCI may contribute to posttraumatic inflammatory responses of TNF-alpha. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

A growing number of these treatments are seeking to be translated into human clinical trials. Conducting such a clinical trial, however, is extremely costly, not only for the time and money required to execute it, but also for the limited resources that will then no longer be available to evaluate other promising therapies. The decision about what therapies have sufficient pre-clinical evidence of efficacy to justify testing in humans is therefore of utmost importance. Here, we have developed a scoring system for objectively grading the body of pre-clinical literature on neuroprotective treatments for acute SCI. The components of the system include an evaluation of a number of factors that are thought to be important in considering the ""robustness'' of a therapy's efficacy, including the animal species and injury models that have been used to test it, the time window of efficacy, the types of functional improvements effected by it, and whether efficacy has been independently replicated. The selection of these factors was based on the results of a questionnaire that was performed within the SCI research community. A modified Delphi consensus-building exercise was then conducted with experts in pre-clinical SCI research to refine the criteria and decide upon how to score them. Finally, the grading system was applied to a series of potential neuroprotective treatments for acute SCI. This represents a systematic approach to developing an objective method of evaluating the extent to which the pre-clinical literature supports the translation of a particular experimental treatment into human trials.","methylprednisolone"

Various degrees of extradural compression were used to induce mild, moderate or severe compression injuries. Furthermore, a locomotor rating scale was developed by which the functional outcome of the spinal cord injury could be assessed. The introduction of such a model will be useful for further studies on the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of spinal cord injury. To assess hindlimb motor function, a 10-point. scale was used. Initially, the animals were allowed to move freely in an open field and were rated 0-5, 0 being no movement and 5 being almost normal. Animals scoring a 5 were then assessed using steel bars with decreasing widths from 2 cm to 5 mm. For each bar successfully crossed over, they gained additional points. Before injury the hindlimb motor function score (MFS) in all the animals was 10. In mice with mild compression, MFS was decreased slightly on day 1 and recovered to 9 +/- 0.6 on day 14. For mice with moderate compression, the MFS decreased to 4.6 +/- 0.4 on day 1 after injury and gradually improved to 8.1 +/- 0.6 on day 14. Severe injury resulted in paraplegia of the hindlimbs day 1 after injury with a score of 0.6 +/- 0.2. By day 14 after injury, these animals gradually recovered to 3.9 +/- 0.1, could bear the weight on the hindlimbs and walk with a severe deficit. There was a 3%, 9% and 19% decrease in the total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord 14 days after mild, moderate and severe injury, respectively. Microtubule-associated protein immunostaining revealed that the gray matter decreased to 61 +/- 7% in moderately injured animals, while severe compression resulted in a complete loss of gray matter. White matter decreased to 86 +/- 6% in moderately injured animals and 29 +/-11% in severely injured animals. This study shows that the mouse can be used to achieve reproducible spinal cord compression injuries of various degrees of severity. The force of the impact correlates well with the neurological and light microscopic outcome. The motor function test presented in this paper and the computerized quantification of tissue damage can be used to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment strategies.","methylprednisolone"

Specifically, we examined, by morphological and cytochemical methods combined with light, confocal and electron microscopy, 1) myelin preservation, ii) activation of adult oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) identified for the expression of NG2 transmembrane proteoglycan, iii) changes in the amount of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans neurocan, versican and phosphacan and of their glycosaminoglycan component labeled with Wisteria floribunda lectin, and iv) ventral horn density of the serotonergic plexus as a marker of descending motor control axons. Injured rats received either saline or a single dose of rhEPO within 30 min after SCI. The results showed that the significant improvement of functional outcome observed in rhEPO-treated rats was associated with a better preservation of myelin in the ventral white matter. Moreover, the significant increase of both the number of NG2-positive OPCs and the labeling for Nogo-A, a marker of differentiated oligodendrocytes, suggested that rhEPO treatment could result in the generation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes. Sparing of fiber tracts in the ventral white matter was confirmed by the increased density of the serotonergic plexus around motor neurons. As for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, only phosphacan, increased in saline-treated rats, returned to normal levels in rhEPO group, probably reflecting a better maintenance of glial-axolemmal relationships along nerve fibers. In conclusion, this investigation expands previous studies supporting the pleiotropic neuroprotective effect of rhEPO on secondary degenerative response and its therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCI and confirms that the preservation of the ventral white matter, which contains descending motor pathways, may be critical for limiting functional deficit.

In contrast, the present study provides evidence that functional and morphological outcome after spinal cord compression injury may occur in a discontinuous, non-Faded manner in response to Linearly graded injury levels. The thoracic spinal cord of adult rats was transiently compressed to thicknesses from 1.8 to 0.8 mm in 0.2 mm steps, or sham injury was administered. Open field motor behavior and segmental reflexes were evaluated up to 21 days post injury and correlated with histological measures and injury level.

In most cells, this is first observed as a collapse of the axolemmas barrier properties allowing a derangement of ions to occur, leading to a progressive dissolution of the cell or its process. We have shown that an artificial sealing of mechanically damaged membranes by topical application of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) immediately restores variable levels of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion. This was documented by a rapid recovery of somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) conduction, and by recovery of the cutaneous trunchi muscle (CTM) reflex in PEG-treated animals. The CTM reflex is a sensorimotor behavior dependent on an intact (and identified) white matter tract within the ventrolateral funiculus of the spinal cord, and is thus an excellent index of white matter integrity. We show that PEG can be safely introduced into the bloodstream by several routes of administration. Using a fluorescein decorated PEG, we demonstrate that the polymer specifically targets the hemorrhagic contusion of the adult guinea pig spinal cord when administered through the vasculature, but not intact regions of the spinal cord. A single subcutaneous injection (30% weight by weight in sterile saline) made 6 hr after a standardized spinal cord contusion in adult guinea pigs was sufficient to produce a rapid recovery of SSEP propagation through the lesion in only PEG-treated animals, accompanied by a statistically significant recovery of the CTM reflex. These data suggest that parenterally administered PEG may be a novel treatment for not only spinal injury, but head injury and stroke as well. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","methylprednisolone"

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI.","methylprednisolone"

This study includes all patients who were enrolled in the Third National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS 3). Motor, sensory, and pain outcomes were assessed using NASCIS scores. Functional outcome was evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data analyses included regression models adjusted for major potential confounders (i.e., sex, ethnicity, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, blood alcohol concentration on admission, drug protocol, cause, and level and severity of SCI). Mortality rates among older people (>= 65 years) were significantly greater than those of younger individuals at 6 weeks, at 6 months, and at 1 year following SCI (38.6% versus 3.1%; p<0.0001). Among survivors, age was not significantly correlated with motor recovery or change in pain scores in the acute and chronic stages after SCI based on regression analyses adjusted for major confounders. However, older individuals experienced greater functional deficit (based on FIM scores) than younger individuals, despite experiencing similar rates of sensorimotor recovery (based on NASCIS scores). Our results suggest that older individuals have a substantially increased mortality rate during the first year following traumatic SCI in comparison with younger patients. Among survivors, the potential of older patients with SCI to neurologically improve within the first year post-injury does not appear to translate into similar functional recovery compared to that seen in younger individuals. Given this fact, rehabilitation protocols that are more focused on functional recovery may reduce disability among older people with acute traumatic SCI.","methylprednisolone"

Although these membrane lipid disturbances are thought to contribute to the paralysis that occur subsequent to spinal cord injury, such a correlation has not been demonstrated directly. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to test the capacity of alpha tocopherol, the major lipid antioxidant in cellular membranes and a compound that limits the injury-induced lipid hydrolysis and peroxidation in spinal cord tissue, to promote functional recovery in a static loading model of spinal cord injury. After laminectomy, the L2 spinal cord of cats was compressed with 180 g for 5 min. For 5 days before injury and for 5 days postinjury, treated cats received orally 1000 IUD-alpha tocopherol acetate daily. Control cats were similarly injured but untreated. All cats were blindly evaluated weekly for 4 weeks for their neurologic recovery based on an 11 point behavioral scale that assessed walking, running, and stair climbing. By the second postinjury week, alpha tocopherol-pretreated cats demonstrated significantly better recovery than untreated controls. By 4 weeks, treated cats had recovered 72% of their preinjury function as compared with 20% for untreated controls, i.e., a 3.5-fold difference. These results strongly suggest that lipid peroxidation and/or hydrolysis is primarily involved in the genesis of posttraumatic paralysis and that alpha tocopherol exerts its protection of injured spinal cord tissue, at least in part, by its antioxidant and/or antilipolytic activity.","methylprednisolone"

More recently, emphasis has been placed on enhancing remyelination and providing oligodendrocyte-protection after a spinal cord injury (SCI). Demyelination post-SCI is part of the cascading secondary injury that takes place immediately after the primary insult; therefore, therapeutic measures are needed to reduce oligodendrocyte death and/or enhance remyelination during the acute stage, preserving neurological functions that would be lost otherwise. In this review a thorough investigation of the oligodendrocyte-protective and remyelinative molecular therapies available to date is provided. The advent of new biomaterials shown to promote remyelination post-SCI is discussed mainly in the context of a combinatorial approach where the biomaterial also provides drug delivery capabilities. The aim of these molecular and biomaterial-based therapies is twofold: (1) oligodendrocyte-protective therapy, which involves protecting already existing oligodendrocytes from undergoing apoptosis/necrosis; and (2) inductive remyelination, which involves harnessing the remyelinative capabilities of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at the lesion site by providing a suitable environment for their migration, survival, proliferation and differentiation. From the evidence reported in the literature, we conclude that the use of a combinatorial approach including biomaterials and molecular therapies would provide advantages such as: (1) sustained release of the therapeutic molecule, (2) local delivery at the lesion site, and (3) an environment at the site of injury that promotes OPC migration, differentiation and remyelination.

The degradation of CSPG by a specific enzyme, chondroitinase ABC, promotes repair. We postulated that a disaccharidic degradation product of this glycoprotein (CSPG-DS), generated following such degradation, participates in the modulation of the inflammatory responses and can, therefore, promote recovery in immune-induced neuropathologies of the CNS, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). In these pathologies, the dramatic increase in T cells infiltrating the CNS is far in excess of the numbers needed for regular maintenance. Here, we show that CSPG-DS markedly alleviated the clinical symptoms of EAE and protected against the neuronal loss in EAU. The last effect was associated with a reduction in the numbers of infiltrating T cells and marked microglia activation. This is further supported by our in vitro results indicating that CSPG-DS attenuated T cell motility and decreased secretion of the cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Mechanistically, these effects are associated with an increase in SOCS-3 levels and a decrease in NF-kappa B. Our results point to a potential therapeutic modality, in which a compound derived from an endogenous CNS-resident molecule, known for its destructive role in CNS recovery, might be helpful in overcoming inflammation-induced neurodegenerative conditions.","methylprednisolone"

Differences in favor of steroid treatment could be detected with regard to the patients' condition at discharge (P = 0.0634). More patients with steroids had a good recovery (49.2% vs 40.7%), and fewer died (16.0% vs 21.5%). Differences in outcome were even more pronounced (P < 0.0145) in patients with a focal lesion and a Glasgow Coma Score on admission of < 8 (n = 93). In this group, 34.8% of the patients made a good recovery, as against 21.3% of the placebo group; mortality was also lower in the verum group (19.6% vs 38.3%). The results indicate that a major subgroup of patients with severe head injury benefits from early administration of triamcinolone. Efficacy of the treatment can be expected, in particular, in patients with a focal cerebral lesion and a Glasgow Coma Score of < 8 on admission.

METHODS: The weight-dropping method was used to produce the experimental SCI in adult rats. Res (50, 100 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (MPSS) 100 mg/kg were injected ip immediately after the induction of SCI. The effects of Res on edema, LDH, Na+, K+-ATPase, and MDA were determined at 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h after SCI compared with MPSS. The electron microscope was employed to investigate the ultrastructural effects of Res on axons, neurons, and subcellular organelles after SCI. RESULTS: Res obviously inhibited the secondary spinal cord edema with the most remarkable suppressing rate by 11.5 % at 48 h. Res significantly suppressed the activities of the lactate dehydrogenase with the highest suppressing rate > 40 % at 24 h. Res markedly improved the Na+, K+-ATPase activities that were promoted to the biggest extent of 60 % at 48 h. At the same time, Res (50 and 100 mg/kg) obviously reduced MDA production in the injured spinal cord tissue in comparison with the SCI model, the most remarkable effect of Res was detected at 48 h with the inhibitory rate >40 %. The ultrastructural findings suggested that SCI caused profound spinal cord damage, which could be protected or improved by injection of Res and MPSS. CONCLUSION: Both Res and MPSS effectively protected the spinal cord from secondary spinal cord injures. But the effects of Res 50 and 100 mg/kg were stronger in improving the energy metabolism system and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation in the local injured spinal cord after SCI than MPSS at the dose of 100 mg/kg.

An annual incidence of 15 to 40 traumatic SCI cases per million population has been reported worldwide, and a conservative estimate for Singapore would be 23 cases per million. With continued improvements in medical care, an increasing prevalence of SCI patients is expected, with corresponding need for comprehensive rehabilitation services led by specialist rehabilitation physicians. Methods: A literature search, review, and summary of findings of recent studies relating to factors associated with recovery, as well as interventions for rehabilitation and promotion of healing of the injured spinal cord was performed. Conclusions: Many SCI patients show improvements in motoric and neurologic level, but those with complete injuries have poor chance of improving American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores. SCI of violent aetiology tends to be more neurologic complete, and those without sacral sparing less likely to improve. Older patients generally do well in activities of daily living. Women have better motor score improvement, although men have better Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores generally. Electrodiagnostic tests such as somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) can help with prognostication, as can imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Immediate surgery for spinal decompression may improve recovery, but whether routine surgery after SCI improves function remains unclear, as does the timing. Methylprednisolone and similar agents appear to help limit secondary injury processes. Rehabilitation interventions such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) and body-weight supported treadmill ambulation training may be effective, as may neural-controlled prostheses and devices. Substances that promote repair and regeneration of the injured spinal cord such as GM-1, 4-AP, BDNG, GDNF, Nogo and MAG-inhibitors, have been studied. Transplanted tissues and cells, such as blood macrophages, bone marrow transplant with GM-CSF, olfactory ensheathing cells, fetal tissues, stem or progenitor cells, have been reported to produce neurological improvements.","methylprednisolone"

Further, to illustrate the impact of SCI only animals did not receive methylprednisolone in order to exclude confounding iatrogenic factors.

To evaluate the role of neuronal degeneration in initiating this response, histopathological changes were compared in C57BL and Wld(S) (delayed Wallerian degeneration mutation) mice. The spinal cord was crushed at T8, producing a primary lesion at the site of the trauma and a secondary lesion extending rostrocaudally in the dorsal columns (where long ascending and descending fiber tracts undergo Wallerian degeneration). Cavitation was relatively mild at both sites and developed mainly at the margins of the lesions. In striking contrast to spinal cord injury in rats, progressive necrosis did not occur in mice; instead, the primary and secondary lesion sites became filled in by macrophages and fibroblasts embedded in a well-vascularized collagenous stroma. Quantitative image analysis revealed that the primary lesion decreased dramatically in size and cavitation between 2 and 3 weeks in C57BL, whereas in Wld(S) the reduction in size and cavitation began later (at 4 weeks) and was less complete. The initial development of the secondary lesion began later and its healing was less complete in Wld(S) than C57BL. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that neuronal damage, including Wallerian degeneration, triggers inflammatory responses leading to tissue repair. For this reason, any delay in neuronal degeneration, as in the Wld(S) mutation, results in deficient tissue repair as reflected in the larger size of both primary and dorsal column lesions.

Patients who did not undergo surgery had more severe spinal cord injuries initially than those who had surgery. However, no differences in neurological improvement at 1-year follow-up were found between those who underwent surgery and those who did not. The results suggest that either early surgery (less than or equal to 25 hours after injury) or late surgery (> 200 hours) may be associated with increased neurological recovery, particularly motor function, but these results are equivocal. Surgery was not shown to interact with pharmacological treatments, indicating that the effect of drug treatment in NASCIS II, reported elsewhere, is not influenced by surgery. Other independent variables that best predicted improvement in motor score were age of 25 years or younger, incomplete injury, and lower baseline emergency department neurological scores. This study does not provide clinically relevant evidence concerning the efficacy of timing or the value of surgery in treating patients with spinal cord injuries.

Strains differ in their ability to manifest, at the right time and intensity, a spontaneous T-cell response to antigens at the lesion site and therefore in their ability to generate a local inflammatory response whose outcome is beneficial (maintenance and repair). All strains, however, can benefit from immune intervention that boosts and regulates the inflammatory response. Because recovery comprises multi-step processes, pharmacological intervention will be less effective than well-synchronized, self-healing immune activity. Risk-free neuroprotective intervention might be achieved by post-traumatic vaccination with a weak, non-pathogenic, auto-antigen, causing autoimmune T cells to home to the lesion site where they become activated and therefore activate local phagocytic cells to remove hostile elements and provide growth factors.","methylprednisolone"

IL-10 also provides trophic support to neurons through the IL-10 receptor. Increased tissue sparing, functional recovery, and neuroprotection are seen with an immediate post-SCI systemic administration of IL-10. Treatment of SCI with IL-10 has been used successfully in combination with Schwann cell and olfactory glial cell grafts, as well as methylprednisolone. Minocycline, tetramethylpyrazine, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment all increase IL-10 levels in a SCI models and result in increased tissue sparing and functional recovery. A chronic systemic administration of IL-10 does not appear to be beneficial to SCI recovery and causes increased susceptibility to septicemia, pneumonia, and peripheral neuropathy. However, a localized upregulation of IL-10 has been shown to be beneficial and can be achieved by herpes simplex virus gene therapy, injection of poliovirus replicons, or surgical placement of a slow-release compound. IL-10 shows promise as a treatment for SCI, although research on local IL-10 delivery timeline and dosage needs to be expanded.","methylprednisolone"

A Phase I clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety of autologous human SC transplantation into the injury epicenter of six subjects with subacute SCI. The trial was an open-label, unblinded, nonrandomized, non-placebo controlled study with a dose escalation design and standard medical rehabilitation. Participants were paraplegics with neurologically complete, trauma-induced spinal lesions. Autologous SCs were cultured in vitro from a sural nerve harvested from each participant and injected into the epicenter of the spinal lesion. Outcome measures for safety were protocol compliance, feasibility, adverse events, stability of neurological level, absence of detectable mass lesion, and the emergence of clinically significant neuropathic pain or muscle spasticity no greater than expected for a natural course cohort. One year post-transplantation, there were no surgical, medical, or neurological complications to indicate that the timing or procedure for the cell transplantation was unsafe. There were no adverse events or serious adverse events related to the cell therapy. There was no evidence of additional spinal cord damage, mass lesion, or syrinx formation.

In this context, the objective of the present work was to develop a new range of three-dimensional (3D) tubular structures aimed at inducing the regeneration within SCI sites. Up to six different 3D tubular structures were initially developed by rapid prototyping: 3D bioplotting-based on a biodegradable blend of starch. These structures were then further complemented by injecting Gellan Gum, a polysaccharide-based hydrogel, in the central area of structures. The mechanical properties of these structures were assessed using dynamic mechanical analysis, under both dry and wet conditions, and their morphologies/porosities were analyzed using micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Biological evaluation was carried out to determine their cytotoxicity, using both minimum essential medium (MEM) extraction and MTS tests, as well as by encapsulation of an oligodendrocyte-like cell (M03-13 cell line) within the hydrogel phase. The histomorphometric analysis showed a fully interconnected network of pores with porosity ranging from 70% to 85%. Scaffolds presented compressive modulus ranging from 17.4 to 62.0 MPa and 4.42 to 27.4 MPa under dry and wet conditions, respectively. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that the hybrid starch/poly-epsilon-caprolactone/Gellan Gum scaffolds were noncytotoxic, as they did not cause major alterations on cell morphology, proliferation, and metabolic viability. Moreover, preliminary cell encapsulation assays showed that the hybrid scaffolds could support the in vitro culture of oligodendrocyte-like cells. Finally, preliminary in vivo studies conducted in a hemisection rat SCI model revealed that the above-referred structures were well integrated within the injury and did not trigger chronic inflammatory processes.

However, free radical scavengers have been largely ineffective in clinical trials, and as such a novel target to attenuate oxidative stress is highly warranted. In addition to free radicals, peroxidation of lipid membranes following spinal cord injury (SCI) produces reactive aldehydes such as acrolein. Acrolein is capable of depleting endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione, generating free radicals, promoting oxidative stress, and damaging proteins and DNA. Acrolein has a significantly longer half-life than the transient free radicals, and thus may represent a potentially better target of therapeutic intervention to attenuate oxidative stress. There is growing evidence, from our lab and others, to suggest that reactive aldehydes such as acrolein play a critical role in oxidative stress and SCI. The focus of this review is to summarize the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of acrolein-induced membrane damage, mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, cell death, and functional loss.

More recent interest has focused on the role of surgical reduction and decompression, particularly ""early"" surgery. A review of the current evidence available in the literature suggests that there is no standard of care regarding the role and timing of surgical decompression. There are insufficient data to support overall treatment standards or guidelines for this topic. There are, however, Class 11 data indicating that early surgery (<24 hours) may be done safely after acute SCI. Furthermore, there are Class III data to suggest a role for urgent decompression in the setting of 1) bilateral facet dislocation and 2) incomplete spinal cord injury with a neurologically deteriorating patient. Whereas there is biologic evidence from experimental studies in animals that early decompression may improve neurologic recovery after SCI, the relevant time frame in humans remains unclear. To date, the role of decompression in patients with SCI is only supported by Class III and limited Class 11 evidence and accordingly can be considered only a practice option. Accordingly, there is a strong rationale to undertake prospective, controlled trials to evaluate the role and timing of decompression in acute SCI.","methylprednisolone"

Furthermore, a brief (2 min) application of the fusogen (M-r 1800, 50 % w/v aqueous solution) to the exposed spinal cord injury in vivo can also cause rapid recovery of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion in association with functional recovery. Behavioral recovery was demonstrated using a long-tract, spinal-cord-dependent behavior in rodents known as the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) reflex. This reflex is observed as a contraction of the skin of the back in response to tactile stimulation. Here, we confirm and extend these preliminary observations. A severe compression/contusion injury to the exposed thoracic spinal cord of the guinea pig was performed between thoracic vertebrae 10 and 11. Approximately 7 h later, a topical application of PEG was made to the injury (dura removed) for 2 min in 15 experimental animals, and levels of recovery were compared with those of 13 vehicle-treated control animals. In PEG-treated animals, 93 % recovered variable levels of CTM functioning and all recovered some level of conduction through the lesion, as measured by evoked potential techniques. The recovered reflex was relatively normal compared with the quantitative characteristics of the reflex prior to injury with respect to the direction, distance and velocity of skin contraction. Only 23 % of the control population showed any spontaneous CTM recovery (P=0.0003) and none recovered conduction through the lesion during the 1 month period of observation (P=0.0001).

As many studies with rat models of SCI have been unable to demonstrate improved behavioral outcome or tissue sparing after MPSS treatment, we chose to stereologically assess whether lit alters lesion volume and tissue sparing over time, as well as long-term behavioral recovery. Adult rats subjected to contusion SCI with the NYU impactor were administered either MPSS or saline for 24 hr beginning 5 min post injury. Over time the lesion dimensions were extremely dynamic, such that by 6 weeks post injury the volumes were reduced to a third of those seen after the first week. MPSS marginally reduced lesion volumes across time vs. controls, but the amount of spared gray and white matter remained unaltered between the two groups. Behavioral results further showed that MPSS failed to improve recovery of hind-limb function. These findings add to the emerging scrutiny of MPSS as the standard therapy for acute SCI, as well as indicate the existence of a therapeutic window for tissue sparing restricted to the first several days after this type of SCI in rats. Equally important, our results caution the use of lesion volume dimensions or percent tissue sparing at the epicenter as indicators of therapeutic efficacy because neither reflects the actual amount of tissue sparing.

Secondarily, we wanted to obtain preliminary evidence if this therapy could be of clinical benefit when compared to a larger number of similar, but historical, control cases. Strict entry criteria permitted recruitment of only neurologically complete paraplegic dogs into this study. Animals were treated by a combination of conventional and experimental techniques within similar to72 h of admission for spinal trauma secondary to acute, explosive disk herniation. Outcome measures consisted of measurements of voluntary ambulation, deep and superficial pain perception, conscious proprioception in hindlimbs, and evoked potentials (somatosensory evoked potentials [SSEP]). We determined that polymer injection is a safe adjunct to the conventional management of severe neurological injury in dogs. We did not observe any unacceptable clinical response to polymer injection; there were no deaths, nor any other problem arising from, or associated with, the procedures. Outcome measures over the 6-8-week trial were improved by polymer injection when compared to historical cases. This recovery was unexpectedly rapid compared to these comparator groups.

Using a rat model of contusive SCI, we compared the effects of EPO [500-5,000 units/kg of body weight (kg-bw)] with MPSS (30 mg/kg-bw) for proinflammatory cytokine production, histological damage, and motor function at 1 month after a compression injury. Although high-dose EPO and MPSS suppressed proinflarnmatory cytokines within the injured spinal cord, only EPO was associated with reduced microglial infiltration, attenuated scar formation, and sustained neurological improvement. Unexpectedly, coadministration of MPSS antagonized the protective effects of EPO, even though the EPO receptor was up-regulated normally after injury. These data illustrate that the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines alone does not necessarily prevent secondary injury and suggest that glucocorticoids should not be coadministered in clinical trials evaluating the use of EPO for treatment of SCI.","methylprednisolone"

High-dose methylprednisolone (MP) treatment is the only accepted treatment for inflammation secondary to human SCI but is minimally effective. Using a rat SCI model, we devised an anti-inflammatory treatment to block the infiltration of neutrophils and hematogenous monocyte/macrophages over the first 2 days postinjury by targeting the CD11dCD18 integrin. Anti-CD11d mAb administration following SCI effectively reduced neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate into lesions by 70% and 36%, respectively, over the first 72 h post-SCI. MP also reduced neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate by 60% and 28%, respectively, but by different mechanisms. The immunosuppression caused by anti-CD11d treatment was not sustained, as inflammatory cell numbers were not different from those observed in untreated SCI control animals at 7 days postinjury. In contrast, in MP-treated animals, the number of macrophages was still suppressed in the lesion while neutrophil numbers were significantly increased. These results suggest that anti-CD11d mAb treatment following SCI will minimize the destructive actions associated with early, uncontrolled leukocyte infiltration into the lesion while permitting the positive wound healing effects of macrophages at later time points.

Focal microinjection experiments have demonstrated that 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f) quinoxaline (NBQX), a highly selective and potent antagonist of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate ionotropic EAA receptors, i.e., those preferring alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) or kainate, can reduce histopathology and functional deficits when administered at 15 min after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Similarly, intravenous infusion of NBQX, beginning at 15 min postinjury (p.i.), results in a significant amelioration of the functional deficits produced by experimental SCI. However, if antagonists of AMPA/kainate receptors were to be used therapeutically for patients with SCI, administration would likely be delayed for several hours after injury. We therefore examined the effects of NBQX administered at 4 h after SCI on functional deficits and histopathology in a standardized rat model of contusive SCI. An incomplete SCI was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats at T8 with a weight-drop device (10 g x 2.5 cm). NBQX (15 nmol), or vehicle alone, was microinjected into the injury site 4 h later Recovery of hind limb reflexes, postural control, and locomotor function was determined by a battery of behavioral tests performed for 8 weeks. Spinal cord tissue was then fixed by perfusion and used for morphometric and immunocytochemical analyses. Previous studies with acute NBQX treatment showed significant functional improvement by 1 week; the effects of delayed NBQX treatment on functional deficits were not discernible until 3-4 weeks after SCI. Thereafter, significant reductions in hindlimb deficits were demonstrated in two independent studies. The nature and magnitude of the reductions in chronic deficits were similar to those observed previously when NBQX was administered acutely at 15 min after SCI. Morphometric analyses showed that delayed treatment with NBQX resulted in sparing of gray matter adjacent to the injury site but no significant effect on the area of white matter at the epicenter. However, serotonin immunoreactivity below the lesion, used as a marker for preservation of one supraspinal pathway, was significantly higher in the NBQX-treated group. These results support a therapeutic potential for NBQX, and presumably other AMPA antagonists, in SCI by demonstrating effectiveness in a clinically relevant time frame. They indicate the importance of assessing chronic functional deficits in evaluating the therapeutic potential of a treatment paradigm. Further, they suggest the intriguing hypothesis that mechanisms underlying early functional recovery after SCI are, at least in part, distinct those from those involved in reducing chronic functional deficits.

However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment.

As a first step towards combining such training paradigms with pharmacotherapy, we evaluated recovery of function in adult rats sustaining a spinal cord contusion injury (MASCIS device, 12.5 mm at T8), either housed in an enriched environment or in standard cages (n = 15 in both groups). The animals in the enriched environment were stimulated to increase their locomotor activity by placing water and food on opposite sides of the cage. As extra stimuli, a running wheel and several other objects were added to the cage. We show that exposure to the enriched environment improves gross and fine locomotor recovery as measured by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, the BBB subscale, the Gridwalk, and the Thoracolumbar height test. However, no group differences were found on our electrophysiological parameters nor on the amount of spared white matter.

One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been selected for clinical evaluation as a cerebroprotective agent. In vitro studies suggest that tirilazad exerts its antioxidant activity by multiple mechanisms including: increasing membrane stability, scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals, reducing LP-induced arachidonic acid release, decreased formation or scavenging of hydroxyl radicals, and maintenance of the levels of endogenous vitamin E. The major site of action appears to be the blood-brain barrier based upon its known localization in cerebrovascular endothelium and numerous studies showing an attenuation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), injury, and ischemia-induced blood-brain barrier permeability. Tirilazad has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in multiple preclinical models of spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and focal cerebral ischemia, as measured by a decrease in cerebral vasospasm, blood-brain barrier compromise, post-traumatic ischemia, edema, ischemic neuronal necrosis and infarction, and improved neurological recovery. This efficacy is correlated with a reduction in markers of oxygen radical-induced LP. Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing in spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and ischemic stroke. Initial results from a European/Australian/New Zealand trial in SAH have shown a significant decrease in mortality and an increase in the incidence of good recovery.","methylprednisolone"

During the course of 5 weeks after the injury, a substantial amount of recovery occurred in the treadmill trained as well as in the untrained rats.

Baseline neurological status was compared to neurological status at follow-up, preferably within one week (101 of 103 subjects).

A greater proportion of experimentally treated dogs than of sham-treated animals showed improvement in every category of functional evaluation at both the 6-week and B-month recheck, with no reverse trend. Statistical significance was not reached in comparisons of some individual categories of functional evaluation between sham-treated and OFS-treated dogs (ambulation, proprioceptive placing); an early trend towards significance was shown in others (deep pain), and significance was reached in evaluations of superficial pain appreciation. An average of all individual scores for all categories of blinded behavioral evaluation (combined neurologic score) was used to compare group outcomes. At the 6-month recheck period, the combined neurologic score of OFS-treated dogs was significantly better than that of control dogs (p = 0.047; Mann-Whitney, two-tailed).","methylprednisolone"

Efficacy was determined by histology, anterograde and retrograde tracing, immunohistochemistry for gliosis and specific nerve fibers, and several behavioral tests. Administration of MP/IL-10 or SC or SC/OEG transplantation significantly increased the total volume of a 9-mm segment of cord encompassing the injury site at 12 weeks. The combination of either SC or SC/OEG transplantation with MP/IL-10 most significantly reduced cavitation. The individual treatments all significantly increased the volume of normal-appearing tissue compared to injury-only controls; however, significant decreases in the volume of normal-appearing tissue were seen when MP/IL-10 and cell grafts were combined compared to MP/IL-10 alone. SC/OEG grafts were effective in promoting serotonergic fiber growth into the graft and led to more reticulospinal fibers caudal to the graft; combination with MP/IL-10 did not further increase fiber number. Only the combination of MP/IL-10 with SC/OEG transplants significantly improved gross locomotor performance (BBB scores) over injury-only controls. MP/IL-10 given prior to SC-only transplants, however, worsened behavioral outcome. Because beneficial effects of MP/IL-10 were not always additive when combined with cell transplantation, we need to understand (1) how tissue protective agents may transform the milieu of the injured spinal cord to the benefit or detriment of later transplanted cells and (2) whether neuroprotectants need to be re-administered at the time of cell grafting or less invasive transplantation techniques employed to reduce damage to tissue spared by an earlier protection strategy.","methylprednisolone"

After SCI, ensheathing cells (ECs) promote recovery in animal models, whereas methylprednisolone (MP) promotes neurological recovery in humans. In this study, the effectiveness of combining ECs and MP after SCI was investigated for the first time. After lesioning the corticospinal tract in adult rats, ECs were transplanted into the lesion, and MP was administered for 24 hr. At 6 weeks after injury, functional recovery was assessed by measuring successful performance of directed forepaw reaching (DFR), expressed as percentages. Axonal regeneration was analyzed by counting the number of corticospinal axons, anterogradely labeled with biotin dextran tetramethylrhodamine, caudal to the lesion. Lesioned control rats, receiving either no treatment or vehicle, had abortive axonal regrowth (1 mm) and poor DFR success (38 and 42%, respectively). Compared with controls, MP-treated rats had significantly more axons 7 mm caudal to the lesion, and DFR performance was significantly improved (57%). Rats that received ECs in combination with MP had significantly more axons than all other lesioned rats up to 13 mm. Successful DFR performance was significantly higher in rats with EC transplants, both without (72%) and with (78%) MP, compared with other lesioned rats. These data confirm previous reports that ECs promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord lesions. In addition, this research provides evidence that, when used in combination, MP and ECs improve axonal regrowth up to 13 mm caudal to the lesion at 6 weeks after injury.","methylprednisolone"

Because a common therapy for acute spinal cord injury is the use of an antiinflammatory synthetic glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone), we sought to determine mechanisms contributing to inflammation shortly after acute injury. Cytokine mRNAs [interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6] were increased during the first 2 hr following weight-drop compression injury by RNase protection assay, prior to the reported appearance of circulating lymphocytes. This immediate pattern of cytokine mRNA induction could be replicated in cultured, explanted spinal cord slices but not in whole blood of injured animals, which is consistent with a tissue source of cytokine mRNAs. Western blotting detected IL-1beta-like immunoreactivity released into culture medium following explantation and pro-IL-1beta-like immunoreactivity in freshly dissected spinal cord tissue. Pharmacologically blocking IL-1 and TNF-alpha receptors significantly reduced expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha mRNAs. Finally, mice lacking both IL-1 and TNF-alpha receptors exhibited diminished induction of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 ra mRNAs following injury. Therefore, we conclude that contusion injury induces an immediate release of cytokines, which then contributes to the induction of cytokine mRNAs. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","methylprednisolone"

We have examined the effects of FK506 and GPI 1046 on the responses to partial transection of ascending spinal dorsal column axons at T9, in some cases combined with crush of one sciatic nerve. FK506 (0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg) and GPI 1046 (10 or 40 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously immediately after surgery and five times a week thereafter. Some animals received methylprednisolone (MP) (two subcutaneous doses of 30 mg/kg) in addition to, or instead of, FK506. After survival times of 1-12 weeks, dorsal column axons were labeled transganglionically with cholera toxin B-HRP. There was massive axonal sprouting at the lesion sites in animals with sciatic nerve injury and immunophilin ligand treatment. In FK506-treated animals a few severed sensory axons regenerated for up to 10 mm rostral to the lesion. Of greater significance, 30% of 71 FK506-treated animals had spared axons in the dorsal column, extending to the nucleus gracilis, versus 8% of 50 control animals (P < 0.05), showing that FK506 reduces the likelihood of axonal destruction due to secondary injury. A combination of FK506 and MP afforded greater protection than MP alone (P < 0.05), but axonal survival was not affected by sciatic nerve crush, dose of FK506, or survival time after injury. GPI 1046 (n = 11) did not promote axonal survival. Thus FK506 protects axons from secondary injury following spinal cord trauma, and in this experimental model, its neuroprotective effect is greater than that of MP.

This activity of methylprednisolone is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions and has been surpassed by the novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids that have been developed that are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than methylprednisolone. One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been shown to be quite effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is the subject of phase Ill clinical trials.

Using a weight-drop model of spinal cord injury, COX-2 mRNA expression was studied with in situ hybridization, COX-2 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western analysis. Finally, using the highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, 1-[(4-methylsufonyl)phenyl]-3-tri-fluro-methyl-5-[(4-fluro)phenyl]prazole (SC58125), the effect of COX-2 inhibition on functional outcome following a spinal cord injury was determined.

These events apparently include the activation of immune-derived cells and their products, as treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, limits the damage and thus improves recovery. On the other hand, immune-derived substances, such as cytokines, are thought to play an important role in post-traumatic axonal regeneration. Thus, the need to reduce inflammation to limit the spread of damage appears to be in conflict with the need to permit inflammation to promote regeneration. Comprehension and resolution of this apparent conflict may lead to the development of treatment protocols aimed at rescuing axons spared by the initial injury, without hampering the potential regeneration of directly and indirectly injured axons. In this study, carried out on rats with crushed optic nerves, daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone commencing prior to the injury significantly attenuated the injury-induced decrease in electrophysiological activity and reduced the area of tissue damage. On the other hand, dexamethasone treatment reduced the permissiveness of the injured nerves to neural adhesion and regrowth in vitro. This latter phenomenon was also observed in injured peripheral nerves. Results are discussed with respect to the possible establishment of an appropriate protocol for corticosteroid treatment of nerve injuries aimed at promoting neuronal rescue without compromising neuronal regeneration.","methylprednisolone"

The model is technically simple and reliable and circumvents some of the biomechanical problems of contusion techniques. It was designed initially to produce moderate injuries, allowing significant recovery of function. A pair of forceps was modified to form an instrument to compress the spinal cord laterally, over a 5-mm length, to a thickness of 1.2 mm. Such compression injuries of the lower thoracic cord were produced in 12 anesthetized, adult guinea pigs, and the outcome monitored, using successive behavioral tests and morphometry of the lesion at 2-3 months. Chronic histopathology was examined quantitatively with line-sampling of axons in 1-mu-m plastic sections through the lesion center, stained with toluidine blue. The type and distribution of damage to axons was similar to that seen following weight-drop contusion trauma in cats. Spinal cord function was examined by means of hindlimb reflex testing and motor behavior, vestibulospinal reflex testing, and mapping the receptive field of the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) reflex. These injuries characteristically resulted in a delayed onset of functional deficits at 1-2 days after injury, followed by partial recovery over the course of several weeks. Overall, functional outcome correlated significantly with the number of surviving axons in the lesion. The phenomenon of ""secondary"" pathology was striking at the behavioral level, whereas evidence of delayed injury has been indirect in most animal models. The onset of this secondary process occurred with a longer delay than has been assumed or implied by most suggested mechanisms of secondary pathology. The time course of secondary loss and recovery may be related to that of the inflammatory response at the injury site, particularly the phagocytic activity of macrophages.","methylprednisolone"

The current standard of care is to administer MP as a bolus of 30 mg/kg followed by a 23-h infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h to spinal cord injured patients. To better understand the role of MP in neuroprotection, we have studied how MP administration affects macrophage accumulation, tissue loss, and axonal dieback at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after a complete transection of the eighth thoracic spinal cord in the adult rat. A 30 mg/kg dose of MP was administered intravenously at 5 min, and 2 and 4 h after injury. The number of ED1 (antibody against microglia/macrophages) -positive cells was quantified in a 500-mu m-wide strip of tissue directly adjacent and parallel to the transection. At all time points, MP treatment led to a significant decrease in the number of ED1-positive cells in both rostral and caudal stumps. Over the 2-month post-transection period, the average MP-induced reduction in the number of ED1-positive cells was 82% in the rostral cord stump and 66% in the caudal stump. Using a computerized image analysis system, it was observed that MP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tissue loss in both cord stumps at 2, 4 and 8 week post-injury. Over the 2-month post-lesion period, the average MP-induced reduction in tissue loss in the caudal cord stump was higher than that in the rostral stump; 48 versus 37%, respectively. Immunostaining for neurofilaments and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) revealed the presence of numerous axons near and in the lesion site. Anterograde neuronal tracing with biotinylated dextran amine showed that, in MP-treated animals, dieback of vestibulospinal fibres, but not of corticospinal fibres, was significantly diminished at all time points studied. In addition, with MP administration, 1 and 2 weeks after injury, an increase in the number of vestibulospinal fibres was found at 1 and 2 mm from the transection, suggesting transient regenerative sprouting of these fibres. The results demonstrate that treatment with MP shortly after spinal cord transection in the adult rat led to a long-term reduction of ED1-positive cells and spinal tissue loss, reduced dieback of vestibulospinal fibres, and a transient sprouting of vestibulospinal fibres near the lesion at 1 and 2 weeks post-lesion. The possible relationships between the inflammatory changes, spinal tissue sparing, and axonal survival and sprouting are complex and need to be further explored.","methylprednisolone"

It is still under debate whether activated microglia promote neuronal survival, or whether they exacerbate the original extent of neuronal damage. Protagonists of the view that microglial cells cause secondary damage have proposed that inhibition of microglial activation by immunosuppression is beneficial after acute CNS damage. It is the aim of this review to analyse the effects of immunosuppressants on isolated microglial cells and neurons, and to scrutinize the effects of immunosuppression in different in vivo models of acute CNS trauma or ischemia. It is found that the immunosuppressants cytosine-arabinoside, different steroids, cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, and minocycline all have direct inhibitory effects on microglial cells. These effects are mainly exerted by inhibiting microglial proliferation or microglial secretion of neurotoxic substances such as proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. Furthermore, immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia results in improved structure preservation and, mostly, in enhanced function. However, all investigated immunosuppressants also have direct effects on neurons, and some immunosuppressants affect other glial cells such as astrocytes. In summary, it is safe to conclude that immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia is neuroprotective. Furthermore, circumferential evidence indicates that microglial activation after traumatic or ischemic CNS damage is not beneficial to adjacent neurons in the immediate aftermath of such acute lesions. Further experiments with more specific agents or genetic approaches that specifically inhibit microglial cells are needed in order to fully answer the question of whether microglial activation is ""good or bad"".

While utility of these therapeutic options provides modest benefits, there is a critical need to identify novel approaches to treat or repair the injured spinal cord in hope to, at the very least, improve upon the patient's quality of life. Thankfully, several discoveries at the preclinical level are now transitioning into the clinical arena. These include the Surgical Treatment for Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (STASCIS) Trial to evaluate the role and timing of surgical decompression for acute SCI, neuroprotection with the semisynthetic second generation tetracycline derivative, minocycline; aiding axonal conduction with the potassium channel blockers, neuroregenerative/neuroprotective approaches with the Rho antagonist, Cethrin (R); the use of anti-NOGO monoclonal antibodies to augment plasticity and regeneration; as well as cell-mediated repair with stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and olfactory ensheathing cells.

In a Phase I clinical trial, we assessed the safety and feasibility of transplantation of autologous mucosal olfactory ensheathing cells and olfactory nerve fibroblasts in patients with complete spinal cord injury. Six patients with chronic thoracic paraplegia (American Spinal Injury Association class A-ASIA A) were enrolled for the study. Three patients were operated, and three served as a control group. The trial protocol consisted of pre- and postoperative neurorehabilitation, olfactory mucosal biopsy, culture of olfactory ensheathing cells, and intraspinal cell grafting. Patient's clinical state was evaluated by clinical, neurophysiological, and radiological tests. There were no adverse findings related to olfactory mucosa biopsy or transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells at 1 year after surgery. There was no evidence of neurological deterioration, neuropathic pain, neuroinfection, or tumorigenesis. In one cell-grafted patient, an asymptomatic syringomyelia was observed. Neurological improvement was observed only in transplant recipients. The first two operated patients improved from ASIA A to ASIA C and ASIA B. Diffusion tensor imaging showed restitution of continuity of some white matter tracts throughout the focus of spinal cord injury in these patients. The third operated patient, although remaining ASIA A, showed improved motor and sensory function of the first spinal cords segments below the level of injury. Neurophysiological examinations showed improvement in spinal cord transmission and activity of lower extremity muscles in surgically treated patients but not in patients receiving only neurorehabilitation. Observations at 1 year indicate that the obtaining, culture, and intraspinal transplantation of autologous olfactory ensheathing cells were safe and feasible. The significance of the neurological improvement in the transplant recipients and the extent to which the cell transplants contributed to it will require larger numbers of patients.","methylprednisolone"

To address this issue, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of autologous bone marrow cell transplantation (BMT) in conjunction with the administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) in six complete SCI patients. BMT in the injury site (1.1 x 10(6) cells/mu L in a total of 1.8 mL) and subcutaneous GM-CSF administration were performed on five patients. One patient was treated with GM- CSF only. The follow- up periods were from 6 to 18 months, depending on the patients. Sensory improvements were noted immediately after the operations. Sensory recovery in the sacral segment was noted mainly 3 weeks to 7 months postoperatively. Significant motor improvements were noted 3 to 7 months postoperatively. Four patients showed neurologic improvements in their American Spiral Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades (from A to C). One patient improved to AIS grade B from A and the last patient remained in AIS grade A. No immediate worsening of neurologic symptoms was found. Side effects of GMCSF treatment such as a fever (> 38 degrees C) and myalgia were noted. Serious complications increasing mortality and morbidity were not found. The follow- up study with magnetic resonance imaging 4 - 6 months after injury showed slight enhancement within the zone of BMT. Syrinx formation was not definitely found. BMT and GM-CSF administration represent a safe protocol to efficiently manage SCI patients, especially those with acute complete injury.

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacological agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger vitamin E (i.e., alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurological recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for treatment of acute neural-injury. The glucocorticoid steroid, methylprednisolone (MP), has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant doses, improves chronic neurological recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of MP is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions, as evidenced by the efficacy of the novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids, which are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than MP. One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently the subject of phase II clinical trials. Recently, compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-aminosteroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) also have shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds further supports the concept that LP is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacological neuroprotection.","methylprednisolone"

Ten randomized controlled trials examining methylprednisolone sodium succinate, tirilizad mesylate, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, thyrotropin releasing hormone, gacyclidine, naloxone, and nimodipine have been completed. Although the primary outcomes in these trials were laregely negative, a secondary analysis of the North American Spinal Cord Injury Study II demonstrated that when administered within 8 hours of injury, methylprednisolone sodium succinate was associated with modest clinical benefits, which need to be weighed against potential complications. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (Phase II trial) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (Phase II and III trials) also showed some promise, but we are unaware of plans for future trials with these agents. These studies have, however, yielded many insights into the conduct of clinical trials for SCI. Several current or planned clinical trials are exploring interventions such as early surgical decompression (Surgical Treatment of Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study) and electrical field stimulation, neuroprotective strategies such as riluzole and minocycline, the inactivation of myelin inhibition by blocking Nogo and Rho, and the transplantation of various cellular substrates into the injured cord. Unfortunately, some experimental and poorly characterized SCI therapies are being offered outside a formal investigational structure, which will yield findings of limited scientific value and risk harm to patients with SCI who are understandably desperate for any intervention that might improve their function. Taken together, recent advances suggest that optimism for patients and clinicians alike is justified, as there is real hope that several safe and effective therapies for SCI may become available over the next decade.

Given this, we sought to critically review the literature regarding the pre-clinical and clinical evidence on the potential impact of timing of surgical decompression of the spinal cord on outcomes after traumatic SCI. The primary literature search was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. A secondary search strategy incorporated articles referenced in prior meta-analyses and systematic and nonsystematic review articles. Two reviewers independently assessed every study with regard to eligibility, level of evidence, and study quality. Of 198 abstracts of pre-clinical studies, 19 experimental studies using animal SCI models fulfilled our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite some discrepancies in the results of those pre-clinical studies, there is evidence for a biological rationale to support early decompression of the spinal cord. Of 153 abstracts of clinical studies, 22 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. While the vast majority of the clinical studies were level-4 evidence, there were two studies of level-2b evidence. The quality assessment scores varied from 7 to 25 with a mean value of 12.41. While 2 of 22 clinical studies assessed feasibility and safety, 20 clinical studies examined efficacy of early surgical intervention to stabilize and align the spine and to decompress the spinal cord; the most common definitions of early operation used 24 and 72 h after SCI as timelines. A number of studies indicated that patients who undergo early surgical decompression can have similar outcomes to patients who received a delayed decompressive operation. However, there is evidence to suggest that early surgical intervention is safe and feasible and that it can improve clinical and neurological outcomes and reduce health care costs. Based on the current clinical evidence using a Delphi process, an expert panel recommended that early surgical intervention should be considered in all patients from 8 to 24 h following acute traumatic SCI.","methylprednisolone"

NASCIS II was initially reported by National Institutes of Health announcements, National Institutes of Health facsimiles to emergency room physicians, and the news media. The subsequent report in the New England Journal of Medicine implied that there was a positive result in the primary efficacy analysis for the entire 487 patient sample. However, this analysis was in fact negative, and the positive result was found only in a secondary analysis of the subgroup of patients who received treatment within 8 hours. In addition, that subgroup apparently had only 62 patients taking methylprednisolone and 67 receiving placebo. The NASCIS II and III reports embody specific choices of statistical methods that have strongly shaped the reporting of results but have not been adequately challenged or or even explained. These studies show statistical artifacts that call their results into question. In NASCIS II, the placebo group treated before 8 hours did poorly, not only when compared with the methylprednisolone group treated before 8 hours but even when compared with the placebo group treated after 8 hours. Thus, the positive result may have been caused by a weakness in the control group rather than any strength of methylprednisolone. In NASCIS III, a randomization imbalance occurred that allocated a disproportionate number of patients with no motor deficit (and therefore no chance for recovery) to the lower dose control group. When this imbalance is controlled for, much of the superiority of the higher dose group seems to disappear. The NASCIS group's decision to admit persons with minor SCIs with minimal or no motor deficit not only enables statistical artifacts it complicates the interpretation of results from the population actually sampled. Perhaps one half of the NASCIS III sample may have had at most a minor deficit. Thus, we do not know whether the results of these studies reflect the severely injured population to which they have been applied. The numbers, tables, and figures in the published reports are scant and are inconsistently defined, making it impossible even for professional statisticians to duplicate the analyses, to guess the effect of changes in assumptions, or to supply the missing parts of the picture. Nonetheless, even 9 years after NASCIS II, the primary data have not been made public. The reporting of the NASCIS studies has fallen far short of the guidelines of the ICH/FDA and of the Evidence-based Medicine Group. Despite the lucrative ""off label"" markets for methylprednisolone in SCI, no Food and Drug Association indication has been obtained. There has been no public process of validation. These shortcomings have denied physicians the chance to use confidently a drug that many were enthusiastic about and has left them in an intolerably ambiguous position in their therapeutic choices, in their legal exposure, and in their ability to perform further research to help their patients.","methylprednisolone"

Three groups of mice received a laminectomy at the T, vertebral level followed by a contusion injury from a predetermined starting load of 1500 dynes, Contusion was produced by rapid displacement of the spinal cord to a peak distance of 0.3, 0.5, or 0.8 mm, with the entire injury and retraction procedure completed over a 23-ms epoch. Control groups received laminectomy alone or complete transection. Functional recovery was examined for 9 weeks after injury using the BBB locomotor rating scale, grid walking, and footprint analysis. Distinct patterns of locomotor recovery were evident across the five groups. Measurements of spared white matter at the epicenter, lesion length, and cross-sectional area of fibronectin-immunopositive scar tissue were also significantly different between injury groups. The severity of injury corresponded with the biomechanical measures recorded at the time of impact as well as with behavioral and histological parameters. The results demonstrate that graded contusion injuries can be produced reliably in mice using the ESCID. The data provide a thorough and quantitative analysis of the effects of contusion injury on long-term behavioral and histological outcome measures in this strain and species.

They found that BMSCs secrete neurotrophic factors and cytokines with therapeutic potential for cell survival and axon growth. In adult immune-suppressed rats, mild, moderate, or severe contusions were generated using the MASCIS impactor. One week following injury, 0.5 to 1 X 106 BMSCs were injected into the lesioned spinal cord; control animals received vehicle injection. Biweekly behavioral tests included the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale (BBB), exploratory rearing, grid walking, and thermal sensitivity. Animals receiving moderate contusions followed by BMSC grafts showed significant behavioral recovery in BBB and rearing tests when compared to controls. Animals receiving BMSC grafts after mild or severe contusion showed trends toward improved recovery. Immunocytochemistry identified numerous axons passing through the injury in animals with BMSC grafts but few in controls. BMSCS were detected at 2 weeks after transplantation; however, at 11 weeks very few grafted cells remained. The authors conclude that BMSCs show potential for repairing SCI.

The pathobiology of SCI involves a primary mechanical insult to the spinal cord and activation of a delayed secondary cascade of events, which ultimately causes progressive degeneration of the spinal cord. Whereas cell death from the mechanical injury is predominated by necrosis, secondary injury events trigger a continuum of necrotic and apoptotic cell death mechanisms. These secondary events include vascular abnormalities, ischemia-reperfusion, glutamate excitotoxicity and disturbances in ionic homeostasis, oxidative cell injury, and a robust inflammatory response. No gold standard therapy for SCI has been established, although clinical trials with methylprednisolone (NASCIS II and III) and GM-1 ganglioside (Maryland and Sygen) have demonstrated modest, albeit potentially important therapeutic benefits. In light of the overwhelming impact of SCI on the individual, other therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. A number of promising pharmacological therapies are currently under investigation for neuroprotective abilities in animal models of SCI. These include the sodium (Na+) channel blocker riluzole, the tetracycline derivative minocycline, the fusogen copolymer polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the tissue-protective hormone erythropoietin (EPO). Moreover, clinical trials investigating the putative neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties ascribed to the Rho pathway antagonist, Cethrin (R) (BioAxone Therapeutic, Inc.), and implantation of activated autologous macrophages (ProCord (R); Proneuron Biotechnologies) in patients with thoracic and cervical SCI are now underway. We anticipate that these studies will harken an era of renewed interest in translational clinical trials.

After SCI, pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) is known to play a pivotal role in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, but the cell types producing proNGF and the signaling pathways involved in proNGF production are primarily unknown. Here, we show that minocycline improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing apoptosis of oligodendrocytes via inhibition of proNGF production in microglia. After SCI, the stress- responsive p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was activated only in microglia, and proNGF was produced by microglia via the p38MAPK-mediated pathway. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced proNGF production in microglia in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Furthermore, minocycline treatment inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor expression and RhoA activation after injury.

Tissue bridges containing axons extend from the spared rim into the cavity dividing it into chambers. Whether descending axons can grow into these trabeculae or whether fibers within the trabeculae are spared fibers remains unclear. The purposes of the present study were (1) to describe the initial axonal response to contusion injury in an identified axonal population, (2) to determine whether and when sprouts grow in the face of the expanding contusion cavity, and (3) in the long term, to see whether any of these sprouts might contribute to the axonal bundles that have been seen within the chronic contusion lesion cavity. The design of the experiment also allowed us to further characterize the development of the lesion cavity after injury. The corticospinal tract (CST) underwent extensive dieback after contusive SCI, with retraction bulbs present from 1 day to 8 months postinjury. CST sprouting occurred between 3 weeks and 3 months, with penetration of CST axons into the lesion matrix occurring over an even longer time course. Collateralization and penetration of reticulospinal fibers were observed at 3 months and were more extensive at later time points. This suggests that these two descending systems show a delayed regenerative response and do extend axons into the lesion cavity and that the endogenous repair can continue for a very long time after SCI (C) 2001 Academic Press.","methylprednisolone"

Open field walking, inclined plane, grid walking, and footprint analysis, and a determination of the percentage of tissue spared at the lesion center were used to assess chronic outcome (6 weeks postinjury). Laminectomy control animals showed no evidence of a functional deficit or histologic lesion. Complete spinal cord transections in normal rats and in a group of animals previously injured (1.1 mm Dspl) and allowed to recover resulted in complete loss of hindlimb function, demonstrating an important functional role for the remaining spared fibers at the lesion site. Consistent spinal cord displacements (0.80 mm, 0.95 mm, and 1.10 mm) resulted in behavioral groups with low outcome variability over a narrow range of incomplete recovery of neurologic function. Significant behavioral (open field walking, inclined plane, and grid walking) and histologic differences were found between the control and Dspl groups and between the 0.80 mm and 1.10 mm Dspl groups. Significant correlations were observed among the injury parameters, behavioral, and histologic scores. Open field walking and inclined plane performance were sensitive indicators of both the early and late phases of neurologic recovery. Grid walking was most useful in animals with small chronic residual deficits. The footprint analysis resulted in less significant correlations and differences between the behavioral groups than the other outcome measures. This may result from a relatively narrow range of sensitivity (open field walking scores between 3.3 and 4.0) and increased variability within the groups.","methylprednisolone"

The demographic of SCIs is shifting such that an increasing proportion of older individuals are being affected. Pathophysiologically, the initial mechanical trauma (the primary injury) permeabilizes neurons and glia and initiates a secondary injury cascade that leads to progressive cell death and spinal cord damage over the subsequent weeks. Over time, the lesion remodels and is composed of cystic cavitations and a glial scar, both of which potently inhibit regeneration. Several animal models and complementary behavioural tests of SCI have been developed to mimic this pathological process and form the basis for the development of preclinical and translational neuroprotective and neuroregenerative strategies. Diagnosis requires a thorough patient history, standardized neurological physical examination and radiographic imaging of the spinal cord. Following diagnosis, several interventions need to be rapidly applied, including haemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit, early surgical decompression, blood pressure augmentation and, potentially, the administration of methylprednisolone. Managing the complications of SCI, such as bowel and bladder dysfunction, the formation of pressure sores and infections, is key to address all facets of the patient's injury experience.","methylprednisolone"

Injecting minocycline after SCI improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Twenty four to 38 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in minocycline-treated rats as compared with those in vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion size increased progressively in both vehicle-treated and minocycline-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with minocycline, the lesion size was significantly reduced at 21-38 days after SCI when compared to the vehicle control. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells 24 h after SCI as compared to that of the vehicle control. DNA gel electrophoresis also revealed a marked decrease in DNA laddering in response to treatment with minocycline. In addition, minocycline treatment significantly reduced the specific caspase-3 activity after SCI as compared to that of vehicle control. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses revealed that minocycline treatment increased expression of interleukin-10 mRNA but decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. These data suggest that, after SCI, minocycline treatment modulated expression of cytokines, attenuated cell death and the size of lesions, and improved functional recovery in the injured rat. This approach may provide a therapeutic intervention enabling us to reduce cell death and improve functional recovery after SCI.","methylprednisolone"

We have utilized PAN/PVC guidance channels to form solid human SC grafts which can be transplanted either with or without the channel. We studied the ability of grafts placed with and without channels to support regeneration ansi, to influence functional recovery; characteristics of the graft and host/graft interface wore also compared. The T9-T10 spinal cord of nude rats was resected and a graft was placed across the gap; methylprednisolone was delivered acutely to decrease secondary injury. Channels minimized the immigration of connective tissue into grafts but contributed to some necrotic tissue loss, especially in the distal spinal cord. Grafts without channels contained more myelinated axons ((x) over bar = 2129 +/- 785) vs ((x) over bar = 1442 +/- 514) and were larger in cross-sectional area ((x) over bar = 1.53 +/- 0.24 mm(2)) vs ((x) over bar = 0.95 +/- 0.86 mm(2)). The interfaces formed between the host spinal cord and the grafts placed without channels were highly interdigitated and resembled CNS-PNS transition zones; chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was deposited there. Whereas several neuronal populations including propriospinal, sensory, motoneuronal, and brainstem neurons regenerated into human SC grafts, only propriospinal and sensory neurons were observed to reenter the host spinal cord. Using combinations of anterograde and retrograde tracers, we observed regeneration of propriospinal neurons up to 2.6 mm beyond grafts. We estimate that 1% of the fibers that enter grabs reenter the host spinal cord by 45 days after grafting. Following retrograde tracing from the distal spinal cord, more labeled neurons were unexpectedly found in the region of the dextran amine anterograde tracer injection site where a marked inflammatory reaction had occurred.

Strategies that nonselectively suppress inflammation have not improved outcomes after SCI, perhaps because inflammation has both adverse and beneficial effects after SCI. We have shown that the selective, time-limited action of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the CD11d subunit of the CD11d/CD18 integrin, delivered intravenously during the first 48 hr after SCI in rats, markedly decreases the infiltration of neutrophils and delays the entry of hematogenous monocyte-macrophages into the injured cord. We hypothesized that this targeted strategy would lead to neuroprotection and improved neurological outcomes. In this study the development of chronic pain was detected in rats by assessing mechanical allodynia on the trunk and hindpaws 2 weeks to 3 months after a clinically relevant clip-compression SCI at the twelfth thoracic segment. The anti-CD11d mAb treatment reduced this pain by half. Motor performance also improved as rats were able to plantar-place their hindpaws and use them for weight support instead of sweeping movements only. Improved cardiovascular outcome was shown after SCI at the fourth thoracic segment by significant decreases in autonomic dysreflexia. Locomotor performance was also improved. These functional changes correlated with significantly greater amounts and increased organization of myelin and neurofilament near the lesion. The improved neurological recovery after the specific reduction of early inflammation after SCI demonstrates that this selective strategy increases tissue at the injury site and improves its functional capacity. This early neuroprotective treatment would be an ideal foundation for building later cell-based therapies.","methylprednisolone"

Two weeks after a hemisection lesion at C3/4, with embryonic spinal tissue implanted immediately at the lesion site, a 10-day delivery of rolipram results in considerable axon regrowth into the transplant and a significant improvement in motor function. Surprisingly, in rolipram-treated animals, there was also an attenuation of reactive gliosis.

Because GM1 may have additive or synergistic effects when used with MP, the authors compared MP, GM1, and MP+GM1 treatments in a graded rat spinal cord contusion model. Spinal cord injury was caused by dropping a rod weighing 10 gm from a height of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 cm onto the rat spinal cord at T-10, which had been exposed via laminectomy. The lesion volumes were quantified from spinal cord Na and K shifts at 24 hours after injury and the results were verified histologically in separate experiments. A single dose of MP (30 mg/kg), given 5 minutes after injury, reduced 24-hour spinal cord lesion volumes by 56% (p = 0.0052), 28% (p = 0.0065), and 13% (p > 0.05) in the three injury-severity groups, respectively, compared to similarly injured control groups treated with vehicle only. Methylprednisolone also prevented injury-induced hyponatremia and increased body weight loss in the spine-injured rats. When used alone, GM1 (10 to 30 mg/kg) had little or no effect on any measured variable compared to vehicle controls; when given concomitantly with MP, GM1 blocked the neuroprotective effects of MP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, GM1 partially prevented MP-induced reductions in lesion volumes, while 10 to 30 mg/kg of GM1 completely blocked these effects of MP. The effects of MP on injury-induced hyponatremia and body weight loss were also blocked by GM1. Thus, GM1 antagonized both central and peripheral effects of MP in spine-injured rats.","methylprednisolone"

Lesions of different severity were studied for signs of endogenous repair at times up to 6 weeks following injury. Contusion injuries produced a typical picture of secondary damage resulting in the destruction of the cord center and the chronic sparing of a peripheral rim of fibers which varied in amount depending upon the injury magnitude. It was noted that the cavities often developed a dense cellular matrix that became partially filled with nerve fibers and associated Schwann cells. The amount of fiber and Schwann cell ingrowth was inversely related to the severity of injury and amount of peripheral fiber sparing. The source of the ingrowing fibers was not, determined, but many of them clearly originated in the dorsal roots. In addition to signs of regeneration, we noted evidence for the proliferation of cells located in the ependymal zone surrounding the central canal at early times following contusion injuries. These cells may contribute to the development of cellular trabeculae that provide a scaffolding within the lesion cavity that provides the substrates for cellular infiltration and regeneration of axons. Together, these observations suggest that the endogenous reparative response to spinal contusion injury is substantial. Understanding the regulation and restrictions on the repair processes might lead to better ways in which to encourage spontaneous recovery after CNS injury.

The teams were grouped into 3 cohorts (A, B, and C), consisting of one experienced team from OSU and two non-OSU teams. The cohorts evaluated the rats in three concurrent and sequential sessions. After viewing a rat for 4 min, individual observers first assigned scores without discussion. Members of each team then discussed and assigned a team score. Experience (OSU vs. non-OSU) and teamwork (individual vs. team) had no significant effect on mean scores although the mean scores of one cohort differed significantly from the others (p = 0.0002, ANOVA). However, experience and teamwork significantly influenced reliability of scoring. OSU team scores had a mean standard deviation or discordance of 0.59 points, significantly less than 1.31 points for non-OSU team scores (p = 0.003, ANOVA) and 1.30 points for non-OSU individual scores (p = 0.001, ANOVA). Discordances were greater at the upper and lower ends of the scale, exceeding 2.0 in the lower (<5) and upper (>15) ends of the scale but were <1.0 for scores between 4 and 16. Comparisons of non-OSU and OSU team scores indicated a high reliability coefficient of 0.892 and a correlation index (r(2)) of 0.894. These results indicate that inexperienced observers can learn quickly to assign consistent BBB scores that approach those given by experienced teams, that the scores are most consistent between 4 and 16, and that experience improves consistency of team scores.","methylprednisolone"

Rats received either a total of 2 x 10 6 cells suspended in culture medium or culture medium only (controls). At 12 weeks after injury, all grafted animals exhibited diminished cavitation. Although in medium-injected rats 33% of spinal tissue within a 5-mm-long segment of cord centered at the injury site was spared, significantly more tissue was spared in SC (51%), OEG (43%), and SC/OEG (44%) grafted animals. All three types of glial grafts were filled with axons, primarily of spinal origin. SC grafts contained more myelinated axons than SC/OEG and OEG grafts. Both types of SC-containing grafts expressed more intense staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan compared with OEG-only grafts. Retrograde tracing demonstrated that the number of propriospinal and brainstem axons reaching 5-6 mm beyond the grafted area was significantly higher with SC and SC/OEG grafts but not with OEG-only grafts compared with controls. Corticospinal fibers terminated closer to the lesion epicenter in all grafted animals than in controls. With SC-only grafts, a modest but statistically significant improvement in hindlimb locomotor performance was detected at 8-11 weeks after injury. Thus, in addition to this functional improvement, our results show that an SC graft is more effective in promoting axonal sparing/regeneration than an SC/OEG or OEG graft in the moderately contused adult rat thoracic spinal cord.","methylprednisolone"

The state of knowledge concerning the neuroprotective pharmacology of methylprednisolone, including mechanism(s) of action, dosing requirements, and time-action considerations is reviewed, as are the results of studies with high doses in experimental and clinical head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral ischemia. A primary neuroprotective mechanism of action in each of these cases is hypothesized to involve the ability of high doses of methylprednisolone to inhibit oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, although additional mechanisms may contribute. Unresolved issues are also addressed, including the therapeutic window, optimum duration of treatment, and rational combination with other neuroprotective agents. A newer methylprednisolone pro-drug with improved solution stability is discussed, together with a brief consideration of novel nonglucocorticoid steroids that surpass methylprednisolone's lipid antioxidant effects without unwanted glucocorticoid properties.","methylprednisolone"

Advances in the neurosclences have drawn attention to research into spinal-cord injury. Nowadays, advanced interventions provide high hope for regeneration and functional restoration. As scientific advances become more frequent, scepticism is giving way to the ideas that spinal-cord injury will eventually be repairable and that strategies to restore function are within our grasp. We address the present understanding of spinal-cord injury, its cause, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment, and look at promising research avenues. We also discuss new treatment options, including functional electric stimulation and part-weight-supported walking.","methylprednisolone"

This is the first of four papers. Here, we examine the spontaneous rate of recovery after SCI and resulting consequences for achieving statistically significant results in clinical trials. We have reanalysed data from the Sygen trial to provide some of this information. Almost all people living with SCI show some recovery of motor function below the initial spinal injury level. While the spontaneous recovery of motor function in patients with motor-complete SCI is fairly limited and predictable, recovery in incomplete SCI patients ( American spinal injury Association impairment scale (AIS) C and AIS D) is both more substantial and highly variable. With motor complete lesions ( AIS A/AIS B) the majority of functional return is within the zone of partial preservation, and may be sufficient to reclassify the injury level to a lower spinal level. The vast majority of recovery occurs in the first 3 months, but a small amount can persist for up to 18 months or longer. Some sensory recovery occurs after SCI, on roughly the same time course as motor recovery. Based on previous data of the magnitude of spontaneous recovery after SCI, as measured by changes in ASIA motor scores, power calculations suggest that the number of subjects required to achieve a significant result from a trial declines considerably as the start of the study is delayed after SCI. Trials of treatments that are most efficacious when given soon after injury will therefore, require larger patient numbers than trials of treatments that are effective at later time points. As AIS B patients show greater spontaneous recovery than AIS A patients, the number of AIS A patients requiring to be enrolled into a trial is lower. This factor will have to be balanced against the possibility that some treatments will be more effective in incomplete patients. Trials involving motor incomplete SCI patients, or trials where an accurate assessment of AIS grade cannot be made before the start of the trial, will require large subject numbers and/or better objective assessment methods.","methylprednisolone"

In patients treated with methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury, increased recovery of neurological function was seen at 6 weeks and at 6 months and continued to be observed 1 year after injury. For motor function, this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.030), and was found in patients with total sensory and motor loss in the emergency room (p = 0.019) and in those with some preservation of motor and sensory function (p = 0.024). Naloxone-treated patients did not show significantly greater recovery. Patients treated after 8 hours of injury recovered less motor function if receiving methylprednisolone (p = 0.08) or naloxone (p = 0.10) as compared with those given placebo. Complication and mortality rates were similar in either group of treated patients as compared with the placebo group.

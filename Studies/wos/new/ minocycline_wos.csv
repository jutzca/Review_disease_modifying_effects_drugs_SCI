Following SCI pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase at the lesion site and play important roles in secondary tissue damage. Methylprednisolone (MP) is a glucocorticoid, and minocycline is a tetracycline-derived antibiotic both with neuroprotective effects on central nervous system trauma. However, there are limited studies on their effects on SCI. In this study, we aimed to evaluate effects of MP+minocycline combined treatment on cellular distribution and localization of TNF-alpha And IL-6 after SCI. Eighty Wistar rats were divided into three main groups as the intact control group, sham operation group, and experimental control group that received spinal cord compression injury. Following the injury, the experimental control group was subdivided into four groups as control, methylprednisolone treatment, minocycline treatment and, MP+minocycline combined treatment groups. Tissue samples were obtained from all groups at 24 hours and 72 hours after the injury. We found a significant decrease in TNF-alpha And IL-6 expressions in combined treatment group at 24 hours after injury. Also, there was a significant decrease in MDA and increase in SOD levels in this group. Furthermore, decreased lipid peroxidation and neuronal and glial cell death were also observed in combined treatment group. These results suggest that MP+minocycline combined treatment promotes functional recovery and, it should be considered as an effective treatment protocol following SCI.","minocycline"

Future advances in SCI diagnosis will likely utilize novel MRI techniques that characterize spinal cord microstructure and functional connectivity. The acute management of SCI is likely to undergo a radical transformation, with numerous potential treatments used in combination, such as neuroprotective and regenerative pharmaceuticals, cellular transplantation, and implantation of structural scaffolds.

Intraoperative cord compression and ischemia are considered the mechanisms of primary injury in this regard. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of minocycline, a promising agent for post-injury treatment, prophylactic administration. In a rat model of SCI through contusion injury, T9 vertebra laminectomy was performed on 40 Sprague-Dawley male rats provided from Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). The reason behind selecting only male rats in our study was the fact that menstrual cycle of female rats affects healing process. Rodents were divided into a sham-operated group, a control group receiving only saline, a minocycline-treated group, and a minocycline pretreated group. Locomotor scaling, behavioral tests for neuropathic pain, and weight changes were evaluated and compared through a 28-days period. At the end of the study, tissue samples were taken to assess neuroinflammatory cytokine and histopathological changes. Minocycline pretreatment was as effective as its post-SCI administration regarding locomotor activity recovery, mechanical pain, and thermal allodynia. Furthermore, spinal cord inflammation and histopathological alterations were both similar in pretreatment and treatment groups indicating substantially better status. None of the treatments could have completely restore or prevent the spinal cord damage. Minocycline pretreatment can show promising therapeutic effects similar to its post-injury administration, inhibiting inflammatory microglial activity.","minocycline"

Animals were divided into six experimental groups (n = 10 per group) as follows: a minocycline administered positive control group, a saline-vehicle negative control group, a sham-operated group, and three experimental groups which received separate doses of sumatriptan (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg). Behavioural assessments were used to evaluate locomotor activity and neuropathic pain for 28 days. At the end of the study, spinal cord tissues were collected from sacrificed animals for histopathological analysis. Levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and two pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin [IL]-1 beta) were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results Sumatriptan significantly (P< 0.001) improved the locomotor activity in SCI group. Sumatriptan was also more effective than the positive control, i.e. minocycline (0.3 mg/kg). Additionally, sumatriptan and minocycline similarly attenuated the mechanical and thermal allodynia in SCI (P< 0.001). TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and CGRP levels in sumatriptan- and minocycline-treated groups significantly (P< 0.001) decreased compared to controls. Histopathological analysis also revealed a markedly improvement in hemorrhage followed by inflammatory cell invasion, neuronal vacuolation, and cyst formation in both sumatriptan- and minocycline-treated groups compared to control animals. Conclusions Sumatriptan improves functional recovery from SCI through its anti-inflammatory effects and reducing pro-inflammatory and pain mediators.","minocycline"

The evidence shows that minocycline has several non-antibacterial effects in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to investigate the effect of minocycline on proliferation, differentiation and migration of embryonic NS/PCs. Materials and methods: NS/PCs extracted from ganglionic eminence of 13.5-day embryonic mice were cultured according to neurosphere protocol. After second passage they were exposed to different doses of minocycline for 7 days. The number and diameter of neurospheres were assessed to evaluate their proliferation. Migration was estimated based on the distances traveled by the cells. Because of the importance of NS/PCs behaviors in 3-dimentional environment, all assessments were done in 3-dimentional and 2-dimentional cultures. Moreover, the fate of NS/PCs to neuron or glial cells was studied. Results: NS/PCs exposed to 1 mu g/ml and 10 mu g/ml of minocycline and those in untreated group traveled significantly longer distances compared to those treated with 50 mu g/ml and 100 mu g/ml of minocycline. In addition, higher doses of minocycline reduced the NS/PCs proliferation remarkably compared to control condition just in 2-D culture. However, the differentiation capacity of cells was not significantly affected by 1 and 10 mu g/ml of minocycline. Conclusion: The behavior of NS/PCs depends on minocycline dose as well as the characteristics of environment.","minocycline"

Lack of an established animal model to test drug treatments hinders the introduction of new pharmacological agents. Avulsion injury of cervical ventral roots can be replicated in rats, resulting in a progressive loss of the motoneurons and increase in neurotoxic expression of microglia. This is a report on the effect of prompt nerve implantation and minocycline treatment on the suppression of microglia activation and survival of motoneurons. 20 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study, which was approved by the Animal Ethical Committee, USM (approval number/2011/(73)(346)). The animals underwent surgical avulsion of the C6 nerve root, followed by reimplantation with peripheral nerve graft and treatment with intraperitoneal minocycline. At 6 weeks postoperatively, immunohistochemistry using primary antibody Iba1 (microglia) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPh) with neutral-red staining (motoneuron) under flourescence microscopy was performed at the C6 spinal cord segment and then quantified. This study showed significant reduction of microglia expression in the study group; mean ranks of control and study group were 15.2 and 11.6, respectively; U= 9.5, Z= 3.02, p< 0.05.

This may be due to the effect of the surgery; the surgery has the potential to cause additional trauma to the cord parenchyma, leading to further motoneuron loss and an increase in scarring around the avulsed region, thus impeding regeneration of the motoneuron.","minocycline"

MH is a clinically-available antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drug that targets a broad range of secondary injury mechanisms via its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. However, MH is only neuroprotective at high concentrations that cannot be achieved by systemic administration, which limits its clinical efficacy. We have developed a hydrogel-based MH delivery system that can be injected into the intrathecal space for local delivery of high concentrations of MH, without damaging spinal cord tissue. Implantation of MH hydrogel after unilateral level-C4/5 contusion SCI robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by in vivo recordings of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and electromyography (EMG) amplitudes. MH hydrogel also decreased lesion size and degeneration of cervical motor neuron somata, demonstrating its central neuroprotective effects within the injured cervical spinal cord. Furthermore, MH hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by the axons of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by both detailed neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from the diaphragm using cholera toxin B (CTB). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that local MH hydrogel delivery to the injured cervical spinal cord is effective in preserving respiratory function after SCI by protecting the important neural circuitry that controls diaphragm activation.","minocycline"

Treatment of SCI still remains a tremendous challenge clinically. Minocycline could target comprehensive secondary injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a known sealing agent, is able to seal the damaged cell membranes and reduce calcium influx, thereby exerting neuroprotective capacity. Here, an E-selectin-targeting sialic acid polyethylene glycol poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SAPP) copolymer was designed for delivering hydrophobic minocycline to achieve combinational therapy of SCI. The obtained SAPP copolymer could self-assemble into micelles with critical micelle concentration being of 13.40 mu g/mL, and effectively encapsulate hydrophobic minocycline. The prepared drug-loaded micelles (SAPPM) displayed sustained drug release over 72 h, which could stop microglia activation and exhibited excellent neuroprotective capacity in vitro. The SAPP micelles were efficiently accumulated in the lesion site of SCI rats via the specific binding between sialic acid and E-selectin. Due to the targeting distribution and combinational effect between PEG and minocycline, SAPPM could obviously reduce the area of lesion cavity, and realize more survival of axons and myelin sheaths from the injury, thus distinctly improving hindlimb functional recovery of SCI rats and conferring superior therapeutic effect in coparison with other groups. Our work presented an effective and safe strategy for SCI targeting therapy.

The development of new treatments for those with SCI may be hampered by the insensitivity of clinical tools to assess motor function in humans. Treatments aimed at preserving neuronal function through anti-inflammatory pathways (i.e., neuroprotection) have been a mainstay of pre-clinical SCI research for decades. Minocycline, a clinically available antibiotic agent with anti-inflammatory properties, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects in a variety of animal models and improved motor recovery in a Phase-2 human trial. Here, we leveraged our recently developed T3 severe contusion model in the rat to determine the ability of minocycline to preserve descending sympathoexcitatory axons and improve cardiovascular control after SCI. Forty-one male Wistar rats were randomized to either a treatment group (minocycline; n = 20) or a control group (vehicle; n = 21). All rats received a severe T3 contusion. Minocycline (or vehicle) was administered intraperitoneally at one hour post-injury (90 mg/kg), then every 12 h for two weeks (45 mg/kg). Neuroanatomical correlates (lesion area, descending sympathoexcitatory axons) were assessed, in addition to an assessment of cardiovascular control (hemodynamics, autonomic dysreflexia) and motor behavior. Here, we show that minocycline reduces lesion area, increases the number of descending sympathoexctitatory axons traversing the injury site, and ultimately reduces the severity of autonomic dysreflexia. Finally, we show that autonomic dysreflexia is a more sensitive marker of treatment stratification than motor function.","minocycline"

This study addressed 2 questions: can repeated injections of hypertonic saline (HS) in humans induce persistent hypersensitivity? Can pretreatment with minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic with microglial inhibitory effects, prevent the onset of hypersensitivity? Twenty-seven healthy participants took part in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, consisting of 6 test sessions across 2 weeks. At the beginning of every session, pressure-pain thresholds of the anterior muscle compartment of both legs were measured to determine the region distribution and intensity of muscle soreness. To measure changes in thermal sensitivity in the skin overlying the anterior muscle compartment of both legs, quantitative sensory testing was used to measure the cutaneous thermal thresholds (cold sensation, cold pain, warm sensation, and heat pain) and a mild cooling stimulus was applied to assess the presence of cold allodynia. To induce ongoing hypersensitivity, repeated injections of HS were administered into the right tibialis anterior muscle at 48-hour intervals. In the final 2 sessions (days 9 and 14), only sensory assessments were done to plot the recovery after cessation of HS administrations and drug washout. By day 9, nontreated participants experienced a significant bilateral increase in muscle soreness (P < .0001), accompanied by the emergence of bilateral cold allodynia in 44% of participants, thus confirming the effectiveness of the model. Placebo-treated participants experienced a bilateral 35% alleviation in muscle soreness (P < .0001), with no changes to the prevalence of cold allodynia. In contrast, minocycline-treated participants experienced a bilateral 70% alleviation in muscle soreness (P < .0001), additionally, only 10% of minocycline-treated participants showed cold allodynia. This study showed that repeated injections of HS can induce a hypersensitivity that outlasts the acute response, and the development of this hypersensitivity can be reliably attenuated with minocycline pretreatment. Perspective: Four repeated Injections of HS at 48-hour intervals induce a state of persistent hypersensitivity in healthy human participants. This hypersensitivity was characterized by bilateral muscular hyperalgesia and cutaneous cold allodynia, symptoms commonly reported in many chronic pain conditions. Minocycline pretreatment abolished the development of this state. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Pain Society","minocycline"

Spinally-injured patients receive opioids within hours of arrival at the emergency room, and prolonged opioid regimens are often employed for the management of post-SCI chronic pain. However, previous studies in our laboratory suggest that the effects of opioids such as morphine may be altered in the pathophysiological context of neurotrauma. Specifically, we have shown that morphine administration in a rodent model of SCI increases mortality and tissue loss at the injury site, and decreases recovery of motor and sensory function, and overall health, even weeks after treatment. The literature suggests that opioids may produce these adverse effects by acting as endotoxins and increasing glial activation and inflammation. To better understand the effects of morphine following SCI, in this study we used flow cytometry to assess immune-competent cells at the lesion site. We observed a morphine-induced increase in the overall number of CD11b + cells, with marked effects on microglia, in SCI subjects. Next, to investigate whether this increase in the inflammatory profile is necessary to produce morphine's effects, we challenged morphine treatment with mino-cycline. We found that pre-treatment with minocycline reduced the morphine-induced increase in microglia at the lesion site. More importantly, minocycline also blocked the adverse effects of morphine on recovery of function without disrupting the analgesic efficacy of this opioid. Together, our findings suggest that following SCI, morphine may exacerbate the inflammatory response, increasing cell death at the lesion site and negatively affecting functional recovery.","minocycline"

For this purpose, PTX-encapsulated poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) PLGA microspheres along with MH were incorporated into the alginate hydrogel. A prolonged and sustained release of MH and PTX from the alginate hydrogel was obtained over eight weeks. The obtained hydrogels loaded with a combination of both drugs or each of them alone, along with the blank hydrogel (devoid of any drugs) were injected into the lesion site after SCI (at the acute phase). Histological assessments showed that the dual-drug treatment reduced inflammation after seven days. Moreover, a decrease in the scar tissue, as well as an increase in neuronal regeneration was observed after 28 days in rats treated with dual-drug delivery system. Over time, a fast and sustained functional improvement was achieved in animals that received dual-drug treatment compared with other experimental groups.

The SCIs disproportionately affect the elderly, especially men. Approximately 60% of these injuries are sustained traumatically through falls, but nontraumatic causes including infections, tumors, and medication-related epidural bleeding have also been documented. Preexisting conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis can render the spine stiff and are risk factors as well as cervical spondylosis and ensuing cervical stenosis. Treatment options vary depending on the severity, location, and complexity of the injury. Surgical management has been growing in popularity over the years and remains an option as it helps reduce spinal cord compression and alleviate pain. Elevating mean arterial pressures to prevent spinal cord ischemia and avoiding the second hit of SCI have become more common as opposed to high dose steroids. Ongoing clinical trials with pharmacological agents such as minocycline and riluzole have shown early, promising results in their ability to reduce cellular damage and facilitate recovery.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be used as a physical therapy for spasticity, but the effects of TENS on spasticity and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Objective. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of TENS on spasticity and the role of activated microglia as underlying mechanisms of TENS treatment for spasticity in rats with a 50-mm contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods. A spinal contusion was made at the T12 spinal segment in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using the NYU impactor. Behavioral tests for motor function were conducted before and after SCI and before and after TENS application. To assess spasticity, the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) was used before and after SCI, high-frequency (HF)/low-frequency (LF) TENS application at 3 different intensities (motor threshold [MT], 50% and 90% MT) or minocycline administration. Immunohistochemistry for microglia was performed at the lumbar spinal segments. Results. Motor recovery reached a plateau approximately 28 days after SCI. Spasticity was well developed and was sustained above the MAS grade of 3, beginning at 28 days after SCI. HF-TENS at 90% MT significantly alleviated spasticity. Motor function did not show any significant changes with LF- or HF-TENS treatment. HF-TENS significantly reduced the proportion of activated microglia observed after SCI. Minocycline, the microglia inhibitor, also significantly alleviated spasticity with the reduction of activated microglia expression. Conclusions. These results suggest that HF-TENS at 90% MT alleviates spasticity in rats with SCI by inhibiting activated microglia.","minocycline"

Spinal cord injury, which mainly affects young adults, leads to devastating consequences for the afflicted person with very few treatment options available. In addition to the initial neuronal and glial cell loss, secondary injuries such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation magnify the initial damage. Current strategies involve surgical stabilization and decompression and post-injury rehabilitation but these result in only limited improvements. Therefore, there is still a need for pharmacological interventions to limit the secondary injury processes and improve functional recovery. Research in the past decade has implicated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as a neuroprotective agent capable of limiting post-injury excitotoxic events. This commentary examines the recent findings suggesting a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role for the PUPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in a mouse model of SCI. These findings on DHA are addressed in relation to previous data on DHA and various other promising treatment options being investigated for SCI.

Its purpose is to accelerate clinical testing of promising therapeutics in spinal cord injury (SCI) through the development of a robust interactive infrastructure. This structure includes key committees that serve to provide longitudinal guidance to the Network. These committees include the Executive, Data Management, and Neurological Outcome Assessments Committees, and the Therapeutic Selection Committee (TSC), which is the subject of this manuscript. The NACTN brings unique elements to the SCI field. The Network's stability is not restricted to a single clinical trial. Network members have diverse expertise and include experts in clinical care, clinical trial design and methodology, pharmacology, preclinical and clinical research, and advanced rehabilitation techniques. Frequent systematic communication is assigned a high value, as is democratic process, fairness and efficiency of decision making, and resource allocation. This article focuses on how decision making occurs within the TSC to rank alternative therapeutics according to 2 main variables: quality of the preclinical data set, and fit with the Network's aims and capabilities. This selection process is important because if the Network's resources are committed to a therapeutic, alternatives cannot be pursued. A proposed methodology includes a multicriteria decision analysis that uses a Multi-Attribute Global Inference of Quality matrix to quantify the process. To rank therapeutics, the TSC uses a series of consensus steps designed to reduce individual and group bias and limit subjectivity. Given the difficulties encountered by industry in completing clinical trials in SCI, stable collaborative not-for-profit consortia, such as the NACTN, may be essential to clinical progress in SCI. The evolution of the NACTN also offers substantial opportunity to refine decision making and group dynamics. Making the best possible decisions concerning therapeutics selection for trial testing is a cornerstone of the Network's function. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2012.5AOSPINE1289)","minocycline"

We found that minocycline exerted strong neuroprotective effects against toxicity induced by bacterial sphingomyelinase and synthetic C2 ceramide. Minocycline enhanced the production of nitric oxide (NO) with resultant increases in cellular cGMP content. Consistently, minocycline-dependent neuroprotection was abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-N-G-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1 H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo (4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). Western blotting revealed that minocycline restored the expression levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)-1, antioxidative thioredoxin-1, and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 that were down-regulated by bacterial sphingomyelinase. Accordingly, the PKG inhibitor KT5823, the thioredoxin reductase inhibitor 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), and a Bcl-2 inhibitor significantly abolished the minocycline neuroprotection. The minocycline-dependent restoration of Bcl-2 was abolished by L-NAME, ODQ and KT5823, but not by DNCB, suggesting the involvement of NO/sGC/PKG but not thioredoxin. Furthermore, minocycline-dependent recovery of thioredoxin-1 was PKG-independent. Taken together, our results indicate that minocycline protects rat cortical neurons against bacterial sphingomyelinase/ceramide toxicity via an NO/cGMP/PKG pathway with induction of Bcl-2 and PKG-independent stimulation of thioredoxin-1.

While therapeutics targeting restoration of single facets of mitochondrial function have proven largely ineffective clinically post-SCI, comprehensively addressing mitochondrial function via pharmacological stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) is an underexplored strategy. This study examined the effects of formoterol, a mitochondrial biogenic Food and Drug Administration-approved selective and potent beta(2)-adrenoreceptor (ADRB2) agonist, on recovery from SCI in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice underwent moderate SCI using a force-controlled impactor-induced contusion model, followed by daily formoterol intraperitoneal administration (0.1 mg/kg) beginning 1 h post-SCI. The SCI resulted in decreased mitochondrial protein expression, including PGC-1 alpha, in the injury and peri-injury sites as early as 3 days post-injury. Formoterol treatment attenuated this decrease in PGC-1 alpha, indicating enhanced MB, and restored downstream mitochondrial protein expression to that of controls by 15 days. Formoterol-treated mice also exhibited less histological damage than vehicle-treated mice 3 days after injury-namely, decreased lesion volume and increased white and gray matter sparing in regions rostral and caudal to the injury epicenter. Importantly, locomotor capability of formoterol-treated mice was greater than vehicle-treated mice by 7 days, reaching a Basso Mouse Scale score two points greater than that of vehicle-treated SCI mice by 15 days. Interestingly, similar locomotor restoration was observed when initiation of treatment was delayed until 8 h post-injury.

The prepared PSM exerted marked anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities both in vitro and in vivo. The administration of PSM could significantly protect neurons and myelin sheaths from damage, reduce the formation of glial scar, recruit endogenous neural stem cells to the lesion site, and promote the regeneration of neurons and the extension of long axons throughout the glial scar, thereby largely improving the locomotor function of SCI rats and exerting a superior therapeutic effect.

Young adult male rats were subjected to experimental SCI by weight compression method. Minocycline (50 mg/kg) and FK506 (1 mg/kg) were administered orally in combination and individually to the SCI group daily for three weeks. During these three weeks, the recovery was measured using behavioral motor parameters (including BBB, Tarlov and other scorings) every other day for 29 days after SCI. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the segment of the spinal cord centered at the injury site was removed for the histopathological studies as well as for biochemical analysis of monoamines such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and some oxidative stress indices, such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TSARS), total glutathione (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO).

The current gold-standard of acute care for spinal cord injury is to administer high doses of glucocorticoids within 8 h of injury; administration after 8 h may be without effect or detrimental to the outcome of the patient. Therefore, improved pharmacological approaches for limiting the extent of tissue damage and neurological dysfunction in the acute injury setting are urgently needed. Early intervention in CNS injury by antagonizing or controlling the post-injury inflammatory process with pharmaceutical agents is a major focus of current clinical and preclinical investigations. In this editorial overview, recent clinical trials and preclinical studies of brain and spinal cord injuries are discussed, including studies focusing on the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs (eg, minocycline); growth factors (eg, erythropoietin); dual anti-inflammatory and anti-vasospasm drugs, such as Rho and ROCK kinase inhibitors; and broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, such as PDE4 inhibitors.

Approximately 60% of patients suffering from acute spinal cord injury (SCI) develop pain within days to weeks after injury, which ultimately persists into chronic stages. To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods. We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results. A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 +/- 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion. While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes. Early intervention with anticonvulsants may have effects beyond pain management and warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in human SCI.","minocycline"

In the present study, we investigate whether minocycline improves axonal regeneration and neurological function recovery by inhibiting the expression of the repulsive guidance molecular A (RGMa) after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 2 h and 3 mg kg1 minocycline was injected intravenously immediately after reperfusion twice a day for 14 days. The staircase test and modified neurological severity score (mNSS) were performed to evaluate functional outcome and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was assessed by Evan's blue dye extravasation (EB) at the expected time point. The expression of RGMa in ischemic cortex was measured by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot 2 weeks after MCAO. Neurofilament protein 200 (NF-200) immunohistochemical staining was used to assess axonal damage. Treatment with minocycline at a dose of 3 mg kg1 via the caudal vein significantly reduced the extravasation of EB, elevated mNSS and improved forelimb motor function as assessed by the staircase test when compared to the I/R group (P < 0.05). Moreover, axonal regrowth was enhanced in the minocycline treatment group when compared to the I/R group (P < 0.05). In addition, minocycline significantly reduced the expression of RGMa protein 2 weeks after MCAO as assessed by both immunostaining and Western blot. Our studies suggest that early minocycline treatment promotes neurological functional recovery and axonal regeneration in rats after MCAO, which might be mediated by down-regulating RGMa expression.

However, activation of various physiological mechanisms secondary to the initial trauma including edema, inflammation, excito-toxicity, excessive cytokine release and apoptosis may exacerbate the injury and/or retard natural repair mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSCs) inhibits H2O2-mediated apoptosis of cultured spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulting in increased cell survival. The ATSC extracts mediated this effect by decreasing caspase-3 and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activity, inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria and reducing Bax expression levels in cells. Direct injection of ATSC extracts mixed with Matrigel into the spinal cord immediately after SCI also resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death, astrogliosis and hypo-myelination but did not reduce the extent of microglia infiltration. Moreover, animals injected with the ATSC extract showed significant functional improvement of hind limbs as measured by the BBB (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) scale. Collectively, these studies show a prominent therapeutic effect of ATSC cytoplasmic extracts on SCI principally caused by an inhibition of apoptosis-mediated cell death, which spares white matter, oligodendrocytes and neurons at the site of injury. The ability of ATSC extracts to prevent secondary pathological events and improve neurologic function after SCI suggests that extracts prepared from autologous cells harvested from SCI patients may have clinical utility.","minocycline"

Successful modulation of these targets has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies with agents such as Oxycyte, Minocycline, Riluzole, Premarin, Cethrin, and ATI-355. The translation of these agents into clinical studies highlights the progress the field has made in the past decade.

This drug delivery system can be injected into the intrathecal space for local delivery of MH with sufficient dose and duration, without causing any additional tissue damage.

This study explored whether OPN secretion and proteolysis by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediate the initial degenerative phase of synaptogenesis, targeting reactive neuroglia to affect successful repair. Adult rats received unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion (UEC) modeling adaptive synaptic plasticity. Over the first week postinjury, hippocampal OPN protein and mRNA were assayed and histology was performed. At 1 similar to 2 d, OPN protein increased up to 51 fold, and was localized within activated, mobilized glia. OPN transcript also increased over 50 fold, predominantly within reactive microglia. OPN fragments known to be derived from MMP proteolysis were elevated at 1 d, consistent with prior reports of UEC glial activation and enzyme production. Postinjury minocycline immunosuppression attenuated MMP-9 gelatinase activity, which was correlated with the reduction of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (LCN2) expression, and reduced OPN fragment generation. The antibiotic also attenuated removal of synapsin-1 positive axons from the deafferented zone. OPN KO mice subjected to UEC had similar reduction of hippocampal MMP-9 activity, as well as lower synapsin-1 breakdown over the deafferented zone. MAP1B and N-cadherin, surrogates of cytoarchitecture and synaptic adhesion, were not affected. OPN KO mice with UEC exhibited time dependent cognitive deficits during the synaptogenic phase of recovery.

Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are partially achieved through conserved mechanisms such as modulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways as well as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Additionally, MH can directly inhibit calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, mitochondrial calcium uptake, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzymatic activity, and iron toxicity. It can also directly scavenge free radicals. Because it can target many secondary injury mechanisms, MH treatment holds great promise for reducing tissue damage and promoting functional recovery following spinal cord injury.","minocycline"

However, evidence suggests that microglia activated in response to injury are detrimental to the survival of new neurons, thus limiting the neurogenic response. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline on neurogenesis and functional recovery after a closed head injury model of focal traumatic brain injury (TBI). Beginning 30 min after trauma, minocycline was administered for up to 2 weeks and bromodeoxyuridine was given on days 1-4 to label proliferating cells. Neurological outcome and motor function were evaluated over 6 weeks using the Neurological Severity Score (NSS) and ledged beam task. Microglial activation was assessed in the pericontusional cortex and hippocampus at 1 week post-trauma, using immunohistochemistry to detect F4/80. Following immunolabeling of bromodeoxyuridine, double-cortin, and NeuN, cells undergoing distinct stages of neurogenesis, including proliferation, neuronal differentiation, neuroblast migration, and long-term survival, were quantified at 1 and 6 weeks in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, as well as in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the pericontusional cortex. Our results show that minocycline successfully reduced microglial activation and promoted early neurological recovery that was sustained over 6 weeks. We also show for the first time in the closed head injury model, that early stages of neurogenesis were stimulated in the hippocampus and subventricular zone; however, no increase in new mature neurons occurred. Contrary to our hypothesis, despite the attenuation of activated microglia, minocycline did not support neurogenesis in the hippocampus, lateral ventricles, or pericontusional cortex, with none of the neurogenic stages being affected by treatment. These data provide evidence that a general suppression of microglial activation is insufficient to enhance neuronal production, suggesting that further work is required to elucidate the relationship between microglia and neurogenesis after TBI.","minocycline"

Timely delivery of specialized care has reduced mortality; however, long-term neurological recovery continues to be limited. In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that ""time is spine,"" infrastructural changes at a systems level are being implemented in many regions around the world to provide a streamlined process for transfer of patients with acute SCI to a specialized unit. With the continued aging of the population, central cord syndrome is soon expected to become the most common form of acute traumatic SCI; characterization of the pathophysiology, natural history, and optimal treatment of these injuries is hence a key public health priority. Collaborative international efforts have led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for traumatic SCI based on robust evaluation of current evidence. The current article provides an in-depth review of progress in SCI, covering the above areas.","minocycline"

BMMC-treated animals received 5 x 106 BMMCs through the caudal vein 24 h post-ischemia. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate functional recovery. Morphometric and histological analyses were performed to assess infarct area, neuronal loss and microglia/macrophage activation up to 21 days post-ischemia. Treatments with minocycline, BMMCs or minocycline-BMMCs reduced infarct area, increased neuronal survival and decreased the number of caspase-3+ and ED-1+ cells, but these effects were more prominent in the minocycline-BMMC group. Behavioral analyses using the modified sticky-tape and open-field tests showed that ischemic rats concomitantly treated with BMMCs and minocycline showed better motor performance than rats treated with BMMCs or minocycline only. The results suggest that proper modulation of the inflammatory response through the blockage of microglia activation enhances neuroprotection and functional recovery induced by intravenous transplantation of BMMCs after motor cortex ischemia.

The authors examined the neuroprotective effect of pregabalin (GP) which is known as to reduce glutamate secretion, in a rat model of spinal cord injury. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four groups; the control group (contusion injury only), the methylprednisolone treated group, the minocycline treated group and the GP treated group. Spinal cord injury was produced by contusion using the New York University impactor (25 g-cm, at the 9th-10th thoracic). Functional evaluations were done using the inclined plane test and a motor rating scale. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling staining technique (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining of cord tissues obtained at 7 days post-injury. Pregabalin treated animals showed significantly better functional recovery, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Mean numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the respective groups were 63.5 +/- 7.4, 53.6 +/- 4.0, 44.2 +/- 3.9 and 36.5 +/- 3.6. Double staining (TUNEL and anti-CC1) for oligodendrocyte apoptosis, was used to calculate oligodendrocyte apoptotic indexes (AI), using the following formula AI = (No. of doubly stained cells/No. of anti-CC1 positive cells) x 100. Mean group AIs were 88.6, 46.7, 82.1 and 70.3%, respectively.

This experiment demonstrates that GP can act as a neuroprotector after SCI in rats, and its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects are related to its neuroprotective effect.

We tested the hypothesis that a key factor in achieving neurological benefits is the exposure of neural cells to local high concentrations of minocycline. This hypothesis was evaluated by using human neurons in culture and in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In culture, neurons were very vulnerable to blood-induced toxicity, with 60% lost within 24 hours in an environment of 5% blood in culture medium. Minocycline reduced blood-induced neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo, the introduction of blood into the striatum of mice to simulate ICH resulted in a massive lesion by 24 hours. When minocycline was mixed with the blood used to inflict ICH, the resulting extent of neuropathology was significantly less than that achieved with intraperitoneal administration of medication. The combination of intracerebral and intraperitoneal minocycline improved neuroprotection compared with either alone. We then delayed minocycline treatment and injected it into the hematoma I hour after ICH. We found greater alleviation of brain damage and neuronal death with increasing concentrations of minocycline injected locally, which was reflected in limited behavioral and histological recovery. We conclude that the prospect of neuroprotection with minocycline is improved by high concentrations of minocycline delivered locally into the central nervous system with supplementation from systemic administration.

In the present work we demonstrate a novel 'syndromic' information-processing approach for capitalizing on heterogeneous data from diverse preclinical models of SCI to discover translational outcomes for therapeutic testing. We first built a large, detailed repository of preclinical outcome data from 10 years of basic research on cervical SCI in rats, and then applied multivariate pattern detection techniques to extract features that are conserved across different injury models. We then applied this translational knowledge to derive a data-driven multivariate metric that provides a common 'ruler' for comparisons of outcomes across different types of injury (NYU/MASCIS weight drop injuries, Infinite Horizons (IH) injuries, and hemisection injuries). The findings revealed that each individual endpoint provides a different view of the SCI syndrome, and that considering any single outcome measure in isolation provides a misleading incomplete view of the SCI syndrome This limitation was overcome by taking a novel multivariate integrative approach for leveraging complex data from Preclinical models of neurological disease to identify therapies that target multiple outcomes. We suggest that applying this syndromic approach provides a roadmap for translating therapies for SCI and other complex neurological diseases.","minocycline"

Many such therapies have reportedly produced promising neurologic benefits in animal models of SCI, but demonstrating convincing efficacy in human clinical trials has remained elusive. This discrepancy may be related in part to differences in the inflammatory response to SCI between human patients and the widely studied rodent models. Our objectives were, therefore, to establish the time course of inflammatory cytokine release in the spinal cord of rats after a thoracic contusion, to determine whether the cytokine release was injury dependent, and to correlate these findings with those that we have recently reported for the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of human SCI patients. After rodent SCI, GRO (the rat equivalent of IL-8), IL-6, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-13, MCP-1, MIP1 alpha, RANTES, and TNF alpha were elevated within the spinal cord, whereas IL-12p70 was decreased. In human SCI, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were also elevated within the cerebrospinal fluid but at later times than those observed in the rodent spinal cord. IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were released in an injury-dependent manner in both the rodent model of SCI and the human condition. In this regard, similar patterns of expression were observed for a number of inflammatory cytokines after SCI in rodent spinal cords and in human CSF. Such proteins may therefore have potential utility as biomarkers and surrogate outcome measures for evaluating biological response to therapeutic interventions.

A discriminate of the role of neuroinflammation may be the time period after SCI, and there is evidence to favor early neuroinflammation being undesirable, whereas the later evolving phase may have useful roles. Here, we have focused on the inflammatory response in the first 24 hours of SCI in mice. We found elevation of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and other cytokines and chemokines within 15 minutes to 3 hours of injury. The early neuroinflammation in SCI is likely to be CNS-derived and involves microglia, as demonstrated by in situ hybridization for IL-1 beta in microglia, by an in vitro model of SCI in which elevation of inflammatory cytokines occurs in the absence of a dynamic source of infiltrating leukocytes, and by the correlation of decreased levels of inflammatory molecules and microglia activity in IL-1 beta-null mice. Nonetheless, as there are no specific immunohistochemical markers that clearly differentiate microglia from their peripheral counterparts, macrophages, the latter cannot be definitively excluded as participants in early neuroinflammation in mouse SCI. These results of an instantaneous inflammatory response validate approaches to modulate microglia/macrophage activity to improve recovery from SCI.","minocycline"

This is especially problematic after traumatic injuries, like spinal cord injury (SCI), since the lack of regeneration leads to lifelong deficits and paralysis. Treatment of SCI has improved during the last several decades due to standardized protocols for emergency medical response teams and improved medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatments. However, SCI continues to result in profound impairments for the individual. There are many processes that lead to the pathophysiology of SCI, such as ischemia, vascular disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, demyelination, and cell death. Current treatments include surgical decompression, hemodynamic control, and methylprednisolone. However, these early treatments are associated with modest functional recovery. Some treatments currently being investigated for use in SCI target neuroprotective (riluzole, minocycline, G-CSF, FGF-2, and polyethylene glycol) or neuroregenerative (chondroitinase ABC, self-assembling peptides, and rho inhibition) strategies, while many cell therapies (embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and macrophages) have also shown promise. However, since SCI has multiple factors that determine the progress of the injury, a combinatorial therapeutic approach will most likely be required for the most effective treatment of SCI.","minocycline"

Previous work has shown that SCI lesions contain an accumulation of activated microglia, which can have multiple pathophysiological influences. Here, we show that activated microglia inhibit axonal growth via repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa). We found that microglia activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibited neurite outgrowth and induced growth cone collapse of cortical neurons in vitro-a pattern that was only observed when there was direct contact between microglia and neurons. After microglia were activated by LPS, they increased expression of RGMa; however, treatment with RGMa-neutralizing antibodies or transfection of RGMa siRNA attenuated the inhibitory effects of microglia on axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, attenuated the effects of microglia and RGMa expression. Finally, we examined whether these in vitro patterns could also be observed in vivo. Indeed, in a mouse SCI model, minocycline treatment reduced the accumulation of microglia and decreased RGMa expression after SCI, leading to reduced dieback in injured corticospinal tracts. These results suggest that activated microglia play a major role in inhibiting axon regeneration via RGMa in the injured CNS.","minocycline"

Differently, the role of activated microglia in injury progression has been poorly investigated, mainly because of the challenges to target and selectively modulate them in situ. A delivery nanovector tool (poly-epsilon-caprolactone-based nanoparticles) able to selectively treat/target microglia has been developed and used here to clarify the temporal and spatial involvement of the proinflammatory response associated to microglial cells in SO. We show that a treatment with nanoparticles loaded with minocycline, the latter a well-known anti-inflammatory drug, when administered acutely in a SCI mouse model is able to efficiently modulate the resident microglial cells reducing the proinflammatory response, maintaining a pro-regenerative milieu and ameliorating the behavioral outcome up to 63 days post injury.

Minocycline, tetramethylpyrazine, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment all increase IL-10 levels in a SCI models and result in increased tissue sparing and functional recovery. A chronic systemic administration of IL-10 does not appear to be beneficial to SCI recovery and causes increased susceptibility to septicemia, pneumonia, and peripheral neuropathy. However, a localized upregulation of IL-10 has been shown to be beneficial and can be achieved by herpes simplex virus gene therapy, injection of poliovirus replicons, or surgical placement of a slow-release compound.

A potential role of macrophages in axonal regeneration was proposed, but it has not been critically addressed whether macrophages play an essential role in the conditioning injury model. After sciatic nerve injury (SNI) in rats, the number of macrophages in DRGs gradually increased by day 7. The increase persisted up to 28 d and was accompanied by upregulation of inflammatory mediators, including oncomodulin. A macrophage deactivator, minocycline, reduced the macrophage number and expressions of the inflammatory mediators. Molecular signatures of conditioning effects were abrogated by minocycline, and enhanced regenerative capacity was substantially attenuated both in vitro and in vivo. Delayed minocycline infusion abrogated the SNI-induced long-lasting heightened neurite outgrowth potential, indicating a role for macrophages in the maintenance of regenerative capacity. Intraganglionic cAMP injection also resulted in an increase in macrophages, and minocycline abolished the cAMP effect on neurite outgrowth. However, conditioned media (CM) from macrophages treated with cAMP did not exhibit neurite growth-promoting activity. In contrast, CM from neuron-macrophage cocultures treated with cAMP promoted neurite outgrowth greatly, highlighting a requirement for neuron-macrophage interactions for the induction of a proregenerative macrophage phenotype. The growth-promoting activity in the CM was profoundly attenuated by an oncomodulin neutralizing antibody. These results suggest that the neuron-macrophage interactions involved in eliciting a proregenerative phenotype in macrophages may be a novel target to induce long-lasting regenerative processes after axonal injuries in the CNS.","minocycline"

Activation of microglia/macrophages and the associated inflammatory response appears to be a self-propelling mechanism that leads to progressive neurodegeneration and development of persisting pain state. Recent advances in polymer science have provided a huge amount of innovations leading to increased interest for polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery tools to treat SCI. In this study, we tested and evaluated in vitro and in vivo a new drug delivery nanocarrier: minocycline loaded in NPs composed by a polymer based on poly-e-caprolactone and polyethylene glycol. These NPs are able to selectively target and modulate, specifically, the activated proinflammatory microglia/macrophages in subacute progression of the secondary injury in SCI mouse model. After minocycline-NPs treatment, we demonstrate a reduced activation and proliferation of microglia/macrophages around the lesion site and a reduction of cells with round shape phagocytic-like phenotype in favor of a more arborized resting-like phenotype with low CD68 staining. Treatment here proposed limits, up to 15 days tested, the proinflammatory stimulus associated with microglia/macrophage activation. This was demonstrated by reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and persistent reduced expression of CD68 in traumatized site.

Yet despite recent advances, upstream releasing mechanisms and effective therapeutic options remain elusive. Previous studies have demonstrated that SCI results in excessive ATP release to the peritraumatic regions and that purinergic signaling, among glial cells, likely plays an essential role in facilitating inflammatory responses and nociceptive sensitization. We sought to assess the role of connexin 43 (Cx43) as a mediator of CNS inflammation and chronic pain. To determine the extent of Cx43 involvement in chronic pain, a weight-drop SCI was performed on transgenic mice with Cx43/Cx30 deletions. SCI induced robust and persistent neuropathic pain including heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in wild-type control mice, which developed after 4 weeks and was maintained after 8 weeks. Notably, SCI-induced heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were prevented in transgenic mice with Cx43/Cx30 deletions, but fully developed in transgenic mice with only Cx30 deletion. SCI-induced gliosis, detected as upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein in the spinal cord astrocytes at different stages of the injury, was also reduced in the knockout mice with Cx43/Cx30 deletions, when compared with littermate controls. In comparison, a standard regimen of post-SCI treatment of minocycline attenuated neuropathic pain to a significantly lesser degree than Cx43 deletion. These findings suggest Cx43 is critically linked to the development of central neuropathic pain following acute SCI. Since Cx43/Cx30 is expressed by astrocytes, these findings also support an important role of astrocytes in the development of chronic pain. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","minocycline"

It is still under debate whether activated microglia promote neuronal survival, or whether they exacerbate the original extent of neuronal damage. Protagonists of the view that microglial cells cause secondary damage have proposed that inhibition of microglial activation by immunosuppression is beneficial after acute CNS damage. It is the aim of this review to analyse the effects of immunosuppressants on isolated microglial cells and neurons, and to scrutinize the effects of immunosuppression in different in vivo models of acute CNS trauma or ischemia. It is found that the immunosuppressants cytosine-arabinoside, different steroids, cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, and minocycline all have direct inhibitory effects on microglial cells. These effects are mainly exerted by inhibiting microglial proliferation or microglial secretion of neurotoxic substances such as proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. Furthermore, immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia results in improved structure preservation and, mostly, in enhanced function. However, all investigated immunosuppressants also have direct effects on neurons, and some immunosuppressants affect other glial cells such as astrocytes. In summary, it is safe to conclude that immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia is neuroprotective. Furthermore, circumferential evidence indicates that microglial activation after traumatic or ischemic CNS damage is not beneficial to adjacent neurons in the immediate aftermath of such acute lesions. Further experiments with more specific agents or genetic approaches that specifically inhibit microglial cells are needed in order to fully answer the question of whether microglial activation is ""good or bad"".

These results support reports that modulating apoptosis, caspases, and microglia provide promising therapeutic targets for prevention and/or limiting the degree of functional loss after CNS trauma.

Although the primary outcomes in these trials were laregely negative, a secondary analysis of the North American Spinal Cord Injury Study II demonstrated that when administered within 8 hours of injury, methylprednisolone sodium succinate was associated with modest clinical benefits, which need to be weighed against potential complications. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (Phase II trial) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (Phase II and III trials) also showed some promise, but we are unaware of plans for future trials with these agents. These studies have, however, yielded many insights into the conduct of clinical trials for SCI. Several current or planned clinical trials are exploring interventions such as early surgical decompression (Surgical Treatment of Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study) and electrical field stimulation, neuroprotective strategies such as riluzole and minocycline, the inactivation of myelin inhibition by blocking Nogo and Rho, and the transplantation of various cellular substrates into the injured cord. Unfortunately, some experimental and poorly characterized SCI therapies are being offered outside a formal investigational structure, which will yield findings of limited scientific value and risk harm to patients with SCI who are understandably desperate for any intervention that might improve their function. Taken together, recent advances suggest that optimism for patients and clinicians alike is justified, as there is real hope that several safe and effective therapies for SCI may become available over the next decade.

The tetracycline derivative minocycline was therapeutically effective in various models of central nervous system injury and disease, via mechanisms involving suppression of inflammation and apoptosis. We therefore investigated the effect of minocycline in TBI using a closed head injury model. Following TBI, mice were treated with minocycline or vehicle, and the effect on neurological outcome, lesion volume, inflammation and apoptosis was evaluated for up to 7 days. Our results show that while minocycline decreases lesion volume and improves neurological outcome at I day post-trauma, this response is not maintained at 4 days. The early beneficial effect is likely not due to anti-apoptotic mechanisms, as the density of apoptotic cells is not affected at either time-point. However, protection by minocycline is associated with a selective anti-inflammatory response, in that microglial activation and interleukin-1 beta expression are reduced, while neutrophil infiltration and expression of multiple cytokines are not affected. These findings demonstrate that further studies on minocycline in TBI are necessary in order to consider it as a novel therapy for brain-injured patients.

The pathobiology of SCI involves a primary mechanical insult to the spinal cord and activation of a delayed secondary cascade of events, which ultimately causes progressive degeneration of the spinal cord. Whereas cell death from the mechanical injury is predominated by necrosis, secondary injury events trigger a continuum of necrotic and apoptotic cell death mechanisms. These secondary events include vascular abnormalities, ischemia-reperfusion, glutamate excitotoxicity and disturbances in ionic homeostasis, oxidative cell injury, and a robust inflammatory response. No gold standard therapy for SCI has been established, although clinical trials with methylprednisolone (NASCIS II and III) and GM-1 ganglioside (Maryland and Sygen) have demonstrated modest, albeit potentially important therapeutic benefits. In light of the overwhelming impact of SCI on the individual, other therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. A number of promising pharmacological therapies are currently under investigation for neuroprotective abilities in animal models of SCI. These include the sodium (Na+) channel blocker riluzole, the tetracycline derivative minocycline, the fusogen copolymer polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the tissue-protective hormone erythropoietin (EPO).

After SCI, pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) is known to play a pivotal role in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, but the cell types producing proNGF and the signaling pathways involved in proNGF production are primarily unknown. Here, we show that minocycline improves functional recovery after SCI in part by reducing apoptosis of oligodendrocytes via inhibition of proNGF production in microglia. After SCI, the stress- responsive p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was activated only in microglia, and proNGF was produced by microglia via the p38MAPK-mediated pathway. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced proNGF production in microglia in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Furthermore, minocycline treatment inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor expression and RhoA activation after injury. Finally, minocycline treatment inhibited oligodendrocyte death and improved functional recovery after SCI. These results suggest that minocycline may represent a potential therapeutic agent for acute SCI in humans.","minocycline"

Animal studies and early clinical trials support its use in several neurological diseases. In animal spinal cord injury models, minocycline improved neurological and histological outcomes, reduced neuronal and oligodendroglial apoptosis, decreased microglial activation and reduced inflammation. A single-centre, human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of minocycline administration after spinal cord injury was undertaken for the purposes of dose optimization, safety assessment and to estimate outcome changes and variance. Neurological, functional, pharmacological and adverse event outcomes were compared between subjects administered 7 days of intravenous minocycline (n = 27) or placebo (n = 25) after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The secondary outcome used to assess neurological differences between groups that may warrant further investigation was motor recovery over 1 year using the American Spinal Cord Injury Association examination. Recruitment and analyses were stratified by injury severity and injury location a priori given the expected influence of these on the sensitivity of the motor exam. Minocycline administered at higher than previously reported human doses produced steady-state concentrations of 12.7 mu g/ml (95% confidence interval 11.6-13.8) in serum and 2.3 mu g/ml (95% confidence interval 2.1-2.5) in cerebrospinal fluid, mimicking efficacious serum levels measured in animal studies. Transient elevation of serum liver enzymes in one patient was the only adverse event likely related to the study drug. Overall, patients treated with minocycline experienced six points greater motor recovery than those receiving placebo (95% confidence interval -3 to 14; P = 0.20, n = 44). No difference in recovery was observed for thoracic spinal cord injury (n = 16). A difference of 14 motor points that approached significance was observed in patients with cervical injury (95% confidence interval 0-28; P = 0.05, n = 25). Patients with cervical motor-incomplete injury may have experienced a larger difference (results not statistically significant, n = 9). Functional outcomes exhibited differences that lacked statistical significance but that may be suggestive of improvement in patients receiving the study drug. The minocycline regimen established in this study proved feasible, safe and was associated with a tendency towards improvement across several outcome measures. Although this study does not establish the efficacy of minocycline in spinal cord injury the findings are encouraging and warrant further investigation in a multi-centre phase III trial.

Rats received a mild, weight-drop contusion injury to the spinal cord and were treated with the vehicle or minocycline at a dose of 90 mg/kg immediately after SCI and then twice at a dose of 45 mg/kg every 12 h. Injecting minocycline after SCI improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Twenty four to 38 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in minocycline-treated rats as compared with those in vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion size increased progressively in both vehicle-treated and minocycline-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with minocycline, the lesion size was significantly reduced at 21-38 days after SCI when compared to the vehicle control. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells 24 h after SCI as compared to that of the vehicle control. DNA gel electrophoresis also revealed a marked decrease in DNA laddering in response to treatment with minocycline. In addition, minocycline treatment significantly reduced the specific caspase-3 activity after SCI as compared to that of vehicle control. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses revealed that minocycline treatment increased expression of interleukin-10 mRNA but decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. These data suggest that, after SCI, minocycline treatment modulated expression of cytokines, attenuated cell death and the size of lesions, and improved functional recovery in the injured rat. This approach may provide a therapeutic intervention enabling us to reduce cell death and improve functional recovery after SCI.","minocycline"

The use of minocycline, an antibiotic that reduces microglial activation, antibody blockade of the CD95 (FAS) ligand and the blockade of glycosphingolipid-induced iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) have recently been shown to reduce neuronal and glial apoptosis with concomitant improvement in neurological function, and appear to enhance the efficacy of cell transplantation strategies.","minocycline"

Based on previous reports, minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, exerts neuroprotection partially by inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c release and reactive microgliosis. We first evaluated cytochrome c release at the injury epicenter after a T10 contusive SCI in rats. Cytochrome c release peaked at approximate to4-8 h postinjury. A dose-response study generated a safe pharmacological regimen that enabled i.p. minocycline to significantly lower cytosolic cytochrome c at the epicenter 4 h after SCI. In the long-term study, i.p. minocycline (90 mg/kg administered 1 h after SCI followed by 45 mg/kg administered every 12 h for 5 days) markedly enhanced long-term hind limb locomotion relative to that of controls. Coordinated motor function and hind limb reflex recoveries also were improved significantly. Histopathology suggested that minocycline treatment alleviated later-phase tissue loss, with significant sparing of white matter and ventral horn motoneurons at levels adjacent to the epicenter. Furthermore, glial fibrillary acidic protein and 2',3' cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase immunocytochemistry showed an evident reduction in astrogliosis and enhanced survival of oligodendrocytes. Therefore, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c is an important secondary injury mechanism in SCI. Drugs with multifaceted effects in antagonizing this process and microgliosis may protect a proportion of spinal cord tissue that is clinically significant for functional recovery. Minocycline, with its proven clinical safety, capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrated efficacy during a clinically relevant therapeutic window, may become an effective therapy for acute SCI.","minocycline"

Reducing the extent of progressive tissue loss ('neuroprotection') following SCI should result in a better recovery from SCI, but treatment options have thus far been limited. In this study, we have tested the efficacy of minocycline in ameliorating damage following acute SCI in mice. This semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic has been reported to inhibit the expression and activity of several mediators of tissue injury, including inflammatory, cytokines, free radicals and matrix metalloproteinases, making it a suitable candidate for study. Mice were subjected to extradural compression of the spinal cord using a modified aneurysm clip, following which they received treatment with either minocycline or vehicle beginning I h after injury. Behavioural testing of hindlimb function was initiated 3 days after injury using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale, and at 1 week using the inclined plane test. Functional assessments demonstrated that minocycline administration significantly improved both hindlimb function and strength from 3 to 28 days after injury compared with vehicle controls. Furthermore, gross lesion size in the spinal cord was significantly reduced by minocycline, and there was evidence of axonal sparing as determined using fluorogold labelling of the rubrospinal tract and by Bielchowsky silver stain. Finally, a comparison of minocycline against the currently approved treatment for acute SCI in humans, methylprednisolone, demonstrated superior behavioural recovery in the minocycline-treated animals.","minocycline"

Although secondary injury should, in principle, be preventable, no effective treatment options currently exist for patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Excessive release of ATP by the traumatized tissue, followed by activation of high-affinity P2X7 receptors, has previously been implicated in secondary injury, but no clinically relevant strategy by which to antagonize P2X7 receptors has yet, to the best of our knowledge, been reported. Here we have tested the neuroprotective effects of a systemically administered P2X7R antagonist, Brilliant blue G (BBG), in a weight-drop model of thoracic SCI in rats. Administration of BBG 15 min after injury reduced spinal cord anatomic damage and improved motor recovery without evident toxicity. Moreover, BBG treatment directly reduced local activation of astrocytes and microglia, as well as neutrophil infiltration. These observations suggest that BBG not only protected spinal cord neurons from purinergic excitotoxicity, but also reduced local inflammatory responses. Importantly, BBG is a derivative of a commonly used blue food color (FD& C blue No. 1), which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Systemic administration of BBG may thus comprise a readily feasible approach by which to treat traumatic SCI in humans.","minocycline"

It has been shown recently that in models of peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord microglia can become activated and contribute to development of pain. Considering their role in pain after peripheral injury, and because microglia are known to become activated after SCI, we tested the hypothesis that activated microglia contribute to chronic pain after SCI. In this study, adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent T9 spinal cord contusion injury. Four weeks after injury, when lumbar dorsal horn multi-receptive neurons became hyperresponsive and when behavioral nociceptive thresholds were decreased to both mechanical and thermal stimuli, intrathecal infusions of the microglial inhibitor minocycline were initiated. Electrophysiological experiments showed that minocycline rapidly attenuated hyperresponsiveness of lumbar dorsal horn neurons. Behavioral data showed that minocycline restored nociceptive thresholds, at which time spinal microglial cells assumed a quiescent morphological phenotype. Levels of phosphorylated-p38 were decreased in SCI animals receiving minocycline. Cessation of delivery of minocycline resulted in an immediate return of pain-related phenomena. These results suggest an important role for activated microglia in the maintenance of chronic central below-level pain after SCI and support the newly emerging role of non-neuronal immune cells as a contributing factor in post-SCI pain.","minocycline"

In this study, we transplanted adult brain-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) isolated from yellow fluorescent protein-expressing transgenic mice into the injured spinal cord of adult rats at 2 and 8 weeks after injury, which represents the subacute and chronic phases of SCI. A combination of growth factors, the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline, and cyclosporine A immunosuppression was used to enhance the survival of transplanted adult NPCs. Our results show the presence of a substantial number of surviving NPCs in the injured spinal cord up to 10 weeks after transplantation at the subacute stage of SCI. In contrast, cell survival was poor after transplantation into chronic lesions. After subacute transplantation, grafted cells migrated > 5mmrostrally and caudally. The surviving NPCs integrated principally along white-matter tracts and displayed close contact with the host axons and glial cells. Approximately 50% of grafted cells formed either oligoden-droglial precursor cells or mature oligodendrocytes. NPC-derived oligodendrocytes expressed myelin basic protein and ensheathed the axons. We also observed that injured rats receiving NPC transplants had improved functional recovery as assessed by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale and grid-walk and footprint analyses. Our data provide strong evidence in support of the feasibility of adult NPCs for cell-based remyelination after SCI.","minocycline"

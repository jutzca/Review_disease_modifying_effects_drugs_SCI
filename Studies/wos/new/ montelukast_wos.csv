Here, we evaluated the role of pseudohypericin(PHP) for its postulated 5-LO inhibitory activity along with a Cys-LT receptor antagonist zafirlukast (ZFL) against inflammatory response and tissue injury in mice.","montelukast"

Ischemia/reperfusion injury may directly or indirectly be responsible for these complications. In this study we sought to determine whether combination of iloprost and montelukast can reduce the ischemia/reperfusion injury of spinal cord in a rat model.","montelukast"

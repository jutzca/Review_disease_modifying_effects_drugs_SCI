METHODS: Studies related to the treatment for acute spinal cord injury were identified via a search of National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC, 2000-11), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2011), TRIP Database (2000-11), and PubMed (1966-2011). Treatment strategies were formulated according to three basic principles: best evidence, doctor's professional experience, and wishes of the patient. RESULTS: A total of 34 articles were selected, including 1 NGC guideline, 22 systematic reviews, and 11 randomized controlled trials. Based on our review, we arrived at the following recommendations: no clinical evidence exists definitively to recommend the use of any of neuroprotective pharmaceuticals; surgery should be undertaken early; mechanical compression devices and low-molecular weight heparin should be employed to prevent thrombosis; respiratory muscle training is beneficial for pulmonary function and quality of life; and functional electrical stimulation and acupuncture can promote functional recovery. The patient accordingly underwent surgery 6 hours after trauma without receiving any neuroprotective pharmaceuticals; low-molecular weight heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression were applied to prevent thrombosis. He also underwent respiratory muscle training daily for 8 weeks and received functional electrical stimulation for 15 minutes and acupuncture for 30 minutes every day. After follow-up for 3 months, the above therapeutic regimen was confirmed efficacious for acute spinal cord injury. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based medicine provides an individualized treatment protocol for acute spinal cord injury, which can significantly improve the therapeutic effect and prognosis.","naloxone"

The benefit of naloxone in the recovery of neurologic function has generally been attributed to its action at the opiate receptors. The effect of naloxone on the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immuno reactivity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, and ultrastructural findings were studied in rats at the early and late stages of SCI, produced with an aneurysm clip on the T2 to T7 segments. Severity rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups. The animals in group I (10 rats) were killed to provide normal spinal cord tissue for testing. Group 2 (20 rats) underwent 6-segment laminectomy so that the effects of total laminectomy Could be determined. Group 3 (20 rats) underwent 6-segment T2 to T7 laminectomy, and SCI was produced by extradural compression of the exposed cord. The same procedures were performed in the 20 rats in group 4, but these rats also received 1 (2 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection of naloxone immediately after the injury, a second dose 24 hours after trauma, and a third dose 48 hours after trauma.

With a patient who is unconscious or whose level of consciousness is impaired the spine must be immobilized to prevent potential neural injury until a spinal injury has been excluded by means of a thorough diagnostic procedure in the hospital. To exclude a spinal injury, normal X-rays have to be taken in the lateral and anteroposterior view. A CT scan is mandatory if the spine, especially the lower cervical spine, cannot be visualized by means of a normal X-ray. An acute, total injury of the spinal cord causes immediate flaccid paralysis and loss of all sensation and reflex activity (including autonomic functions) below the level of injury (spinal shock). Patients with an acute, total cervical spinal cord injury show diaphragmatic respiration, bradycardia and hypotension. Patients who are unconscious and/or show signs of respiratory insufficiency require early intubation and assisted ventilation. In the case of emergency intubation, orotracheal intubation with inline manual cervical immobilization is indicated. Cardiovascular resuscitation mainly requires the application of crystalloids and colloids; if hypotension persists, dobutamin must be added. It is debatable whether a high dose of methylprednisolone applied initially during the acute phase gives better results in relation to the spinal cord lesion. Patients who sustain acute traumatic injuries of the cervical spine with associated neurologic deficit may benefit from immediate surgical decompression and stabilization. Patients with a total lesion between the C4 and C6 levels will almost always show hypoventilation. All these patients need an artificial airway for a longer period and, for that reason, a tracheotomy should be performed early on. After days or weeks, the flaccid paralysis changes to spastic paraplegia due to exaggeration of the normal stretch reflexes. Muscle spasms occur and autonomic reflexes return. With the return of the spinal reflexes, precautions must be taken to prevent autonomic dysreflexia, a syndrome characterized by paroxysmal hypertension, bradycardia, sweating, facial flushing and headache. In severe cases cerebral haemorrhage and seizures may occur, precipitated by stimuli such as defecation or bladder distension. In the case of uro-genital procedures, especially cystoscopy, a general anaesthesia with an adequate depth or, better, a spinal anaesthesia has to be performed to prevent the onset of autonomic dysreflexia. Managing patients with paraplegia requires a staff of professional health-care workers familiar with the problems of spinal cord injury. For this reason, patients with spinal cord lesion should be transferred as soon as possible to a centre specialising in this kind of injury.","naloxone"

Given this, an examination of whether blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is a potential determinant of survival and neurological and functional recovery after acute traumatic SCI was carried out. Methods All patients who were enrolled in the Third National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-3) were included. The study population was divided into non-alcohol' (BAC equal to 0 parts per thousand), legal' (BAC greater than 0 up to 0.8 parts per thousand) and illegal' (BAC greater than 0.8 parts per thousand) subgroups. Outcome measures included survival, NASCIS motor and sensory scores, NASCIS pain scores and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) determinants at baseline and at 6weeks, 6months and 1year post-SCI. Analyses were adjusted for major potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, trial protocol, Glasgow coma score, and cause, level and severity of SCI. Results Among 499 patients (423 males and 76 females; ages from 14 to 92years), the mean BAC was 0.054 +/- 0.006 parts per thousand (range 0-1). The survival at 1year (94.4%) was not associated with the BAC (P=0.374). Moreover, BAC was not significantly correlated with motor recovery (0.166), sensory recovery (0.323), change in pain score (0.312) or functional recovery (0.133) at 6weeks, 6months and 1year post-SCI. Conclusions Our results, for the first time, show that the BAC at emergency admission does not adversely affect the patients' mortality, neurological impairment or functional disability over the course of the first year after SCI.","naloxone"

When naltrexone (20 mg/kg) was administered 10 min after induction of ischemia, it was totally ineffective in decreasing the occurrence and severity of allodynia. In contrast, MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) still had a good protective effect when injected as this time. Histological examination showed slight morphological damage in the spinal cord in 38% of control rats after 1 min laser irradiation without pretreatment with naltrexone. No morphological abnormalities were observed in rats after pretreatment with naltrexone (20 mg/kg). The results suggest that opioid receptor antagonists and NMDA receptor antagonists prevent a consequence of transient spinal cord ischemia through different mechanisms. High doses of opioid antagonists may have anti-ischemic effects by improving local spinal cord microcirculation and therefore may have a role in preventing ischemia after traumatic spinal cord injury. On the other hand, the NMDA receptor may have a role in the secondary neuronal death resulting from ischemia. Thus, NMDA receptor antagonists may contribute to the prevention of tissue damage by antagonizing the excitotoxic action of glutamate and/or aspartate released by ischemia into the spinal cord. Finally, since only high doses of naltrexone had an effect in the present study, we cannot rule out the possiblity that this drug may act through non-opioid mechanisms.","naloxone"

The scientific and federal regulatory processes by which new drugs are discovered and implemented clinically permit clinicians to evaluate the potential benefits of any new agent, and provide an estimate of the duration required for promising new agents to be made clinically available. Understanding these processes makes the task of classifying the availability status of new drugs much simpler, allowing rational dissemination of realistic information to patients and their families frequently made desperate for viable alternatives to the prospect of permanent paralysis. In this review, we describe the scientific and regulatory processes necessary for the clinical introduction of new drugs using spinal cord injury as an example.

While naloxone had no overt effect in acute spinal cats, in chronic spinal cats naloxone induced the release of large volumes of urine and produced marked hind limb hyper-reflexia. Prominent tachyphylaxis and tolerance to the effects of naloxone were evident. Immunohistochemical studies indicated a marked increase in leucine enkephalin and dynorphin in sacral spinal neurons.

Spinal cord injury was produced in urethane anesthetized animals by a longitudinal incision into the right dorsal horn of T10-11 segments (2 mm deep and 5 mm long). Spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEP) were recorded epidurally from the T9 (rostral) and T12 (caudal) segments after stimulation of the ipsilateral tibial and sural nerves at the ankle. SCEP from both rostral and caudal segments consisted of a small positive peak followed by a high negative peak. Infliction of trauma in untreated rats resulted in an immediate depression of the rostral maximal negative peak (MNP) amplitude. This depression was long-lasting. Later, a significant increase in the latency of the rostral MNP amplitude occurred. Naloxone was administered in a high dosage (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to block mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors 30 min before injury. This drug treatment inhibited the immediate post-injury decrease of the rostral MNP amplitude without any significant effect on latency changes. Measurement of water content in the traumatized spinal cord segment showed a significant reduction in the drug treated animals 5 h after trauma (71.46 +/- 0.54) as compared with untreated controls (74.65 +/- 0.76). However, 1 mg or 5 mg/kg dosages of the drug were not effective in reducing the SCEP changes or edema after injury. These results strongly suggest that blockade of kappa-opioid receptors with high doses of naloxone is important in reduction of trauma induced alteration of SCEP and edema formation in spinal cord injury.","naloxone"

The rationale for this regimen has been based upon the need for high doses (i.e., 30 mg/kg initial IV dose) to inhibit posttraumatic lipid peroxidation (LP) in the injured spinal segment. However, injury also triggers the immediate calcium-mediated activation of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), the release of arachidonic acid, and the enzymatic formation of potentially deleterious prostaglandins (PGF(2 alpha), PGE(2)), thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and leukotrienes (LTs). Thus, in view of the glucocorticold receptor-mediated inhibition of PLA(2) that underlies much of MP's antiinflammatory actions, an additional neuroprotective mechanism may relate to an inhibition of eicosanoid formation. Using the cat spinal cord compression model (180g x 5 min at L3; Na pentobarbitol anesthesia), we examined whether 30 min postinjury dosing with MP (30 mg/kg IV) could attenuate spinal tissue eicosanoid levels measured by enzyme immunoassay at 1h(Experiment 1). Pial blood flow was measured over the dorsal columns at the injury site using laser doppler flowmetry to monitor posttraumatic hyperperfusion as an index of the microvascular pathophysiology of acute SCI. In vehicle treated animals at 1 h postinjury, there was a significant increase in the tissue levels of PGF(2 alpha) (+290%), PGE(2) (+260%), TXB(2) (stable analog of TXA(2), +126%), and LTB(4) (+73%) in comparison to sham, uninjured animals. However, 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha), (stable analog of prostacyclin or PGI(2)) and LTC(4) did not increase. Methylprednisolone did not reduce the increase in eicosanoid production. Tn the case of LTB(4) and LTC(4), MP actually increased the levels further. In addition, we examined the effects of a double dose MP regimen (30 mg/kg IV at 30 min plus 15 mg/kg IV at 2.5 h postinjury) on spinal cord eicosanoid levels at 4 h postinjury (Experiment 2). At 4 h postinjury, significant increases in PGF(2 alpha), PGE(2), TXB(2), and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) were observed, and with the exception of PGE(2), no MP attenuation of the increased eicosanoids was seen. These results fail to provide evidence that postinjury administration of high dose MP exerts a significant anti-PLA(2) action. On the other hand, MP effectively inhibited secondary spinal cord pial hyperperfusion, which is believed to be largely mediated by free radical-lipid peroxidative mechanisms. Thus, it seems likely that the protective action of MP on the acute microvascular pathophysiology of SCI is mediated by its well-documented effects on posttraumatic LP. In support of this conclusion, parallel experiments were carried out that demonstrated that 30 min postinjury treatment with the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid LP inhibitor tirilazad mesylate, which completely lacks any PLA(2)-inhibitory action, also eliminated posttraumatic pial hyperperfusion without any effect on the increase in spinal cord eicosanoids at either 1 or 4 h postinjury.","naloxone"

The metabolic product of TRH (cyclo-his-pro) retains physiological activity. We have developed a number of novel cyclic dipeptides that are structurally similar to cyclo-his-pro, and have examined their neuroprotective activity across multiple ire vitro models of neuronal injury and after traumatic brain injury (TB() in rodents. Four such compounds were found to reduce cell death after trophic withdrawal or traumatic injury in primary neuronal cultures; two also protected against glutamate or beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. All compounds significantly improved motor and cognitive recovery after controlled cortical impact injury in mice, and markedly reduced lesion volumes as shown by high field magnetic resonance imaging. Further, compound 35b, which is being developed for clinical trials, also showed considerable neuroprotection after fluid percussion induced TBI in rats, and improved cognitive function after daily administration in chronically brain injured rats. At a mechanistic level, the drugs attenuate both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in primary neuronal cultures, markedly reduce intracellular calcium accumulation after injury, and limit changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and associated cytochrome c release. In addition, microarray studies show that 356 reduces transcriptional changes after injury for a number of genes (and proteins) that may be associated with secondary injury, including cell cycle genes, aquaporins and cathepsins. It also upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), heat shock proteins (HSP) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Thus, these novel dipeptides have multipotential actions that make them candidates for the treatment of both acute and chronic neurodegeneration.","naloxone"

The study showed that patients who received the drug within 8 hr after injury improved, whereas those who received the drug later did not. The drug significantly increased recovery even in severely injured patients who were admitted with no motor or sensory function below the lesion, contradicting a long-held dogma that such patients would not recover. Some researchers, however, have questioned the stratification of the patient population, the use of summed neurologic change scores, and the absence of functional assessments. The stratification by injury severity and treatment time was planned a priori and based on objective criteria. Detailed analyses revealed no differences between groups attributable to stratification or randomization. While multivariate analyses of the summed neurologic scores were used, the conclusions were corroborated by other analytical approaches that did not rely on summed scores. For example, treatment with methylprednisolone more than doubled the probability that patients would convert from quadriplegia or paraplegia to quadriparesis or paraparesis, analgesia to hypoalgesia, and anesthesia to hypoesthesia. The treatment also significantly improved neurologic scores in lumbosacral segments, indicating that beneficial effects were not limited to segments close to the lesion site. The treatment did not significantly affect mortality or morbidity. The study strongly suggests that methylprednisolone has significant beneficial effects in human spinal cord injury, that these effects occur only when the drug is given within 8 hr, and that it helps even in patients with severe spinal cord injuries.

These findings indicate the need for preclinical studies to examine potential drug-drug interactions in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) trauma.","naloxone"

This study includes all patients who were enrolled in the Third National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS 3). Motor, sensory, and pain outcomes were assessed using NASCIS scores. Functional outcome was evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data analyses included regression models adjusted for major potential confounders (i.e., sex, ethnicity, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, blood alcohol concentration on admission, drug protocol, cause, and level and severity of SCI). Mortality rates among older people (>= 65 years) were significantly greater than those of younger individuals at 6 weeks, at 6 months, and at 1 year following SCI (38.6% versus 3.1%; p<0.0001). Among survivors, age was not significantly correlated with motor recovery or change in pain scores in the acute and chronic stages after SCI based on regression analyses adjusted for major confounders. However, older individuals experienced greater functional deficit (based on FIM scores) than younger individuals, despite experiencing similar rates of sensorimotor recovery (based on NASCIS scores). Our results suggest that older individuals have a substantially increased mortality rate during the first year following traumatic SCI in comparison with younger patients. Among survivors, the potential of older patients with SCI to neurologically improve within the first year post-injury does not appear to translate into similar functional recovery compared to that seen in younger individuals. Given this fact, rehabilitation protocols that are more focused on functional recovery may reduce disability among older people with acute traumatic SCI.","naloxone"

Patients who did not undergo surgery had more severe spinal cord injuries initially than those who had surgery. However, no differences in neurological improvement at 1-year follow-up were found between those who underwent surgery and those who did not. The results suggest that either early surgery (less than or equal to 25 hours after injury) or late surgery (> 200 hours) may be associated with increased neurological recovery, particularly motor function, but these results are equivocal. Surgery was not shown to interact with pharmacological treatments, indicating that the effect of drug treatment in NASCIS II, reported elsewhere, is not influenced by surgery. Other independent variables that best predicted improvement in motor score were age of 25 years or younger, incomplete injury, and lower baseline emergency department neurological scores.

There appeared to be no discernible treatment effect in patients with complete injuries although data were available from only six such patients at 4 months. For the incomplete injury group, a total of 6 treated and 5 placebo patients had 4-month evaluations. TRH treatment was associated with significantly higher motor, sensory, and Sunnybrook scores than placebo treatment.

As a first step towards combining such training paradigms with pharmacotherapy, we evaluated recovery of function in adult rats sustaining a spinal cord contusion injury (MASCIS device, 12.5 mm at T8), either housed in an enriched environment or in standard cages (n = 15 in both groups). The animals in the enriched environment were stimulated to increase their locomotor activity by placing water and food on opposite sides of the cage.

We show that exposure to the enriched environment improves gross and fine locomotor recovery as measured by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, the BBB subscale, the Gridwalk, and the Thoracolumbar height test. However, no group differences were found on our electrophysiological parameters nor on the amount of spared white matter.

Ten randomized controlled trials examining methylprednisolone sodium succinate, tirilizad mesylate, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, thyrotropin releasing hormone, gacyclidine, naloxone, and nimodipine have been completed. Although the primary outcomes in these trials were laregely negative, a secondary analysis of the North American Spinal Cord Injury Study II demonstrated that when administered within 8 hours of injury, methylprednisolone sodium succinate was associated with modest clinical benefits, which need to be weighed against potential complications. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (Phase II trial) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (Phase II and III trials) also showed some promise, but we are unaware of plans for future trials with these agents. These studies have, however, yielded many insights into the conduct of clinical trials for SCI. Several current or planned clinical trials are exploring interventions such as early surgical decompression (Surgical Treatment of Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study) and electrical field stimulation, neuroprotective strategies such as riluzole and minocycline, the inactivation of myelin inhibition by blocking Nogo and Rho, and the transplantation of various cellular substrates into the injured cord. Unfortunately, some experimental and poorly characterized SCI therapies are being offered outside a formal investigational structure, which will yield findings of limited scientific value and risk harm to patients with SCI who are understandably desperate for any intervention that might improve their function. Taken together, recent advances suggest that optimism for patients and clinicians alike is justified, as there is real hope that several safe and effective therapies for SCI may become available over the next decade.

NASCIS II was initially reported by National Institutes of Health announcements, National Institutes of Health facsimiles to emergency room physicians, and the news media. The subsequent report in the New England Journal of Medicine implied that there was a positive result in the primary efficacy analysis for the entire 487 patient sample. However, this analysis was in fact negative, and the positive result was found only in a secondary analysis of the subgroup of patients who received treatment within 8 hours. In addition, that subgroup apparently had only 62 patients taking methylprednisolone and 67 receiving placebo. The NASCIS II and III reports embody specific choices of statistical methods that have strongly shaped the reporting of results but have not been adequately challenged or or even explained. These studies show statistical artifacts that call their results into question. In NASCIS II, the placebo group treated before 8 hours did poorly, not only when compared with the methylprednisolone group treated before 8 hours but even when compared with the placebo group treated after 8 hours. Thus, the positive result may have been caused by a weakness in the control group rather than any strength of methylprednisolone. In NASCIS III, a randomization imbalance occurred that allocated a disproportionate number of patients with no motor deficit (and therefore no chance for recovery) to the lower dose control group. When this imbalance is controlled for, much of the superiority of the higher dose group seems to disappear. The NASCIS group's decision to admit persons with minor SCIs with minimal or no motor deficit not only enables statistical artifacts it complicates the interpretation of results from the population actually sampled. Perhaps one half of the NASCIS III sample may have had at most a minor deficit. Thus, we do not know whether the results of these studies reflect the severely injured population to which they have been applied. The numbers, tables, and figures in the published reports are scant and are inconsistently defined, making it impossible even for professional statisticians to duplicate the analyses, to guess the effect of changes in assumptions, or to supply the missing parts of the picture. Nonetheless, even 9 years after NASCIS II, the primary data have not been made public. The reporting of the NASCIS studies has fallen far short of the guidelines of the ICH/FDA and of the Evidence-based Medicine Group. Despite the lucrative ""off label"" markets for methylprednisolone in SCI, no Food and Drug Association indication has been obtained. There has been no public process of validation. These shortcomings have denied physicians the chance to use confidently a drug that many were enthusiastic about and has left them in an intolerably ambiguous position in their therapeutic choices, in their legal exposure, and in their ability to perform further research to help their patients.","naloxone"

This is the first of four papers. Here, we examine the spontaneous rate of recovery after SCI and resulting consequences for achieving statistically significant results in clinical trials. We have reanalysed data from the Sygen trial to provide some of this information. Almost all people living with SCI show some recovery of motor function below the initial spinal injury level. While the spontaneous recovery of motor function in patients with motor-complete SCI is fairly limited and predictable, recovery in incomplete SCI patients ( American spinal injury Association impairment scale (AIS) C and AIS D) is both more substantial and highly variable. With motor complete lesions ( AIS A/AIS B) the majority of functional return is within the zone of partial preservation, and may be sufficient to reclassify the injury level to a lower spinal level. The vast majority of recovery occurs in the first 3 months, but a small amount can persist for up to 18 months or longer. Some sensory recovery occurs after SCI, on roughly the same time course as motor recovery. Based on previous data of the magnitude of spontaneous recovery after SCI, as measured by changes in ASIA motor scores, power calculations suggest that the number of subjects required to achieve a significant result from a trial declines considerably as the start of the study is delayed after SCI. Trials of treatments that are most efficacious when given soon after injury will therefore, require larger patient numbers than trials of treatments that are effective at later time points. As AIS B patients show greater spontaneous recovery than AIS A patients, the number of AIS A patients requiring to be enrolled into a trial is lower. This factor will have to be balanced against the possibility that some treatments will be more effective in incomplete patients. Trials involving motor incomplete SCI patients, or trials where an accurate assessment of AIS grade cannot be made before the start of the trial, will require large subject numbers and/or better objective assessment methods.","naloxone"

In patients treated with methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury, increased recovery of neurological function was seen at 6 weeks and at 6 months and continued to be observed 1 year after injury. For motor function, this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.030), and was found in patients with total sensory and motor loss in the emergency room (p = 0.019) and in those with some preservation of motor and sensory function (p = 0.024). Naloxone-treated patients did not show significantly greater recovery. Patients treated after 8 hours of injury recovered less motor function if receiving methylprednisolone (p = 0.08) or naloxone (p = 0.10) as compared with those given placebo. Complication and mortality rates were similar in either group of treated patients as compared with the placebo group. The authors conclude that treatment with the study dose of methylprednisolone is indicated for acute spinal cord trauma, but only if it can be started within 8 hours of injury.","naloxone"

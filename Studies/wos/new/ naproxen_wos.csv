Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent, endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective substance that has been explored for use in the design of novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the current study, we evaluated the potential beneficial effects of ATB-346 [2-(6-methoxynapthalen- 2-yl)-propionic acid 4-thiocarbamoyl-phenyl ester], an H2S-releasing derivative of naproxen, in a murine model of spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in mice by spinal cord compression, produced through the application of vascular clips to the dura via a T5 to T8 laminectomy. ATB-346, naproxen (both at 30 mol/kg), or vehicle was orally administered to the mice 1 and 6 h after SCI and once daily thereafter for 10 d. Motor function [Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) of locomotion] improved gradually in the mice treated with naproxen. However, those treated with ATB-346 exhibited a significantly more rapid and sustained recovery of motor function, achieving greater than double the increase in locomotion score of the naproxen group by the 10th day of treatment. ATB-346 also significantly reduced the severity of inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis of neural tissue, and nitrosative stress) that characterized the secondary effects of SCI. Again, the effects of ATB-346 were superior to those of naproxen for several parameters. These results showed marked beneficial effects of an H2S-releasing derivative of naproxen in an animal model of SCI, significantly enhancing recovery of motor function, possibly by reducing the secondary inflammation and tissue injury that characterizes this model. The combination of inhibition of cyclooxygenase and delivery of H2S may offer a promising alternative to existing therapies for traumatic injury.Campolo, M., Esposito, E., Ahmad, A., Di Paola, R., Wallace, J.

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report. we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.

The growth inhibitions from CNS myelin and astroglial chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans partially account for the lack of CNS repair. Here, we show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin, the drugs widely used as pain relievers in the clinic, can surmount axon growth restrictions from myelin and proteoglycans by potently inhibiting their downstream pathway RhoA signal. Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [( R)-(+)trans- N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)- cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma. In contrast, the non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have the axon growth-promoting effects on cultured or lesioned neurons. These studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs in treating CNS injuries characterized by axonal disconnection including spinal cord injury.","naproxen"

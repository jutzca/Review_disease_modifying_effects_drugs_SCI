Thus, agents which are able to modulate macrophage phenotypes may provide significant benefits to SCI patients. In the present study, we demonstrate that the niacin receptor HCA(2) is specifically expressed on the cell surface of M1 but not M2 macrophages. Treatment of M1 macrophages with niacin (300 mu M) resulted in down-regulation of the p65 NF-kappa B phosphorylation, associated with a marked decrease in the levels of M1 markers, including CD86, IL-12, and IL-6, and a significant increase in the expressions of M2 markers, such as CD206, IL-10, and IL-13, suggesting that niacin causes a shift of M1 to M2. Moreover, treatment of the M1-oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) co-cultures with niacin markedly promoted the expression of myelin binding protein (MBP). After SCI in C57/BL6 mice for a week, a marked accumulation of M1 macrophages, which expressed HCA(2) receptor, was evident in the wound. Treatment of the SCI mice with niacin (100 mg/kg) resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of M1 macrophages and a significant increase in the number of M2 macrophages in the wound. This was associated with a robust inflammation resolution, attenuation of demyelination and neurofilament loss, and significant improvement of locomotor function. Thus, HCA(2) receptor may serve as a therapeutic target to promote post-SCI recovery. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","niacin"

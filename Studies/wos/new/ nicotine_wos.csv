Intravenous administration of TRH dose dependently shortened the duration of unconsciousness after concussion in the mouse (ED50 = 3.2 mg/kg). The improvement of recovery evoked by TRH (3 mg/kg i.v.) after concussion was not affected by i.p. pretreatment with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, p-chlorophenylalanine, scopolamine or methylscopolamine. However, mecamylamine or hexamethonium i.p. pretreatment completely inhibited the TRH-induced improvement of outcome in traumatic brain injury. The results imply that TRH-induced improvement of recovery after concussion is not associated with increased activity of monoaminergic neurons in the brain. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of TRH upon unconsciousness after concussion in mice is mainly produced by activation of central cholinergic systems via nicotinic receptors whereas muscarinic receptors seem to be not implicated.

In the present study, we hypothesized that the altered expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may contribute to these effects. Recent evidence indicates that nicotine can exert potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects in spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the administration of nicotine can influence expression of inducible NOS (NOS) and/or neuronal NOS (nNOS) in injured spinal cords. Adult male Long-Evans rats were subjected to a moderate contusion model of SCI and received a single intraperitoneal injection of either saline or nicotine (0.35, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg) 2 hr after trauma. SCI dramatically increased NOS (but not nNOS) mRNA and protein levels in microglial cells in the thoracic and lumbar regions of spinal cords. NOS overexpression resulted in increased nitrotyrosine formation, decreased number of NeuN (neuronal nuclei)immunoreactive cells, and up-regulation of inflammatory genes. Most importantly, these effects were markedly attenuated by nicotine acting via a receptor-mediated mechanism. These data may have significant therapeutic implications for the targeting of nicotine receptors in the treatment of compressive spinal cord trauma. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","nicotine"

Evidence indicates that nicotine can induce potent neuroprotective effects against injury to spinal cord neurons. Therefore, the present study was focused on the effects of nicotine on the behavioral and morphological recovery associated with SCI. Adult male Long-Evans rats were subjected to a moderate contusion model of SCI and received subcutaneous injections of nicotine for 14 days at the dose of 0.35 or 7 mg/kg/day. The rats were examined using the BBB locomotor rating scale for 6 weeks. At the end of the BBB recording, spinal cords were examined for the volumetric tissue sparing of gray and white matters. All SCI rats demonstrated a loss of hindlimb function followed by a recovery phase that peaked at 2-3 weeks after the trauma. Compared to untreated SCI rats, chronic nicotine administration appeared to improve the recovery of the locomotor functions. Indeed, nicotine-treated animals scored consistently higher on the BBB scale indicating that the treatment altered animal behavior. However, when taking under consideration correction factors for multiple comparisons, these data did not reach significance at overall experimental levels of significance 0.05. Nevertheless, nicotine administration was effective in sparing tissue at injury epicenter and a lower dose of nicotine also resulted in significant sparing of white matter of the injured spinal cord. These results suggest that agonists of neuronal nicotinic receptors can be attractive candidates for SCI therapy.","nicotine"

In addition, recent evidence indicates that nicotine can induce potent neuroprotective effects. To study the influence of nicotine on the redox signaling pathways in relationship to SCI, moderate contusions of spinal cords at the level of T-10 were induced in rats treated or untreated with nicotine. Cellular oxidative stress, DNA binding activity of redox-responsive transcription factors (AP-1, NF-kappaB and CREB) as well as mRNA levels of inflammatory genes (MCP-1 and TNF-alpha) were determined in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cords. Nicotine was administrated 2 h after the SCI in a single i.p. injection at the dose of 0.35, 3.5 or 7 mg/kg, and rats were sacrificed 3 It following such an injection. Spinal cord trauma was associated with a significant increase in oxidative stress, and activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1 and CREB, as well as overexpression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha in both the thoracic and lumbar regions. Nicotine administration following the SCI markedly attenuated, especially in the lumbar region, these oxidative and proinflammatory responses. These protective effects of nicotine were fully reversed by inhibition of neuronal nicotinic receptors by mecamylamine. The present results indicate that nicotine administration can attenuate the oxidative injury to spinal cords and suggest that neuronal nicotinic receptors can be attractive targets for neuroprotective therapy.

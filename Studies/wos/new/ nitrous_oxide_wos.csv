Adult rats were implanted with various sizes of hygroscopic plastic material at the T12 spinal level to determine the dimensions that would produce a progressive neurologic deficit from which recovery could occur. Neurologic evaluation was conducted on an inclined plane, noting the maximum angle at which an animal was able to maintain orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal midline. Scores were statistically modeled for each group to develop profiles of neurologic deficits. Rats were subjected to a 4-h exposure to isoflurane, fentanyl/nitrous oxide, or ketamine 7 or 8 days postimplantation. Neurologic outcomes were compared to a SCI reference group which received no postimplant anesthesia. An animal weight/desiccated implant volume (W-a/V-i) ratio of 53 to 73 g/mm(3) produced postimplant neurologic deficits which deteriorated to near maximum within 3 days, followed by a gradual improvement beginning at Day 8 and returning to near normal between 22 and 25 days. Final outcome was based on modeled ramp scores for each group and reported in degrees +/- SD: reference, 71.2 +/- 1.1; fentanyl/N2O, 70.4 +/- 0.3; isoflurane, 72.6 +/- 1.1; and ketamine, 64.9 +/- 0.6. The fentanyl group attained maximum recovery first (P > 0.05) but did not recover to a level different on the average from the reference group. The ketamine group demonstrated a poorer (P > 0.05) recovery level relative to the other anesthetic protocols.","nitrous_oxide"

In initial experiments, animals were subjected to 25, 50 or 100 g cm impact injuries at T10 during pentobarbital or halothane anesthesia and their outcomes determined using somatosensory-evoked potentials, blinded neurologic evaluations for two weeks, and post-mortem analysis of spinal serotonin levels. Subsequently, halothane anesthesia was combined with either pentobarbital or nitrous oxide or given as a late treatment to pentobarbital anesthetized rats subjected to 50 g cm injuries. A series of acute studies were then performed in order to assess the hemodynamic and respiratory concomitants of halothane vs. pentobarbital, as well as the effect of mechanical ventilation and bicarbonate treatment upon halothane neuroprotection. Finally, the effect of a 50 g cm impact upon local white matter spinal cord blood flow was measured during halothane or pentobarbital anesthesia using laser-Doppler flowmetry.","nitrous_oxide"

Recordings taken before placing the neural tissue at risk were assessed for variability in amplitude and latency. The lower limit in amplitude was approximately one-third (25-43%) of the baseline, The latencies were more difficult to monitor than were the amplitudes. The latency variations were 2.56 +/- 0.50 milliseconds for the hand and 6.84 +/- 1.37 milliseconds for the leg. During surgery, the unilateral recordings of two patients were transiently lost but partially recovered after a pause in the operation. No obvious postoperative weaknesses in the corresponding limbs occurred. One patient, who showed a permanent loss of unilateral recording, had transient monoplegia with a complete recovery. None of the remaining five patients who had amplitudes larger than one-third of the baseline at the end of the operation had additional motor deficits. Our conclusions are that under etomidate anesthesia, the magnetic motor evoked potentials can be convenient and reliable monitors of motor function, that changes in the amplitude may be superior to those in the latency for intraoperative warning, that the criterion for potential neural damage under magnetic motor evoked potential monitoring might be an amplitude reduction of two-thirds of the control value, and that the magnetic stimulation seems to be more sensitive than the electrical stimulation in the monitoring of motor function and also allows more time and opportunities for the motor function to recover.","nitrous_oxide"

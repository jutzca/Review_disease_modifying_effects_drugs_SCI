In the central nervous system, acute trauma has two stages: the primary injury and the secondary injury. The former is irreversible, and is a direct consequence of the impact. In the aftermath of the injury, a complex series of processes exacerbate the injury and amplify tissue damage. Some of these processes are local, others involve a systemic response. It is these processes which ultimately determine the clinical outcome. The aim of the treatments is a) to confer neuroprotection and b) to promote neuroregeneration. The results reported so far with omega-3 fatty acids in animal models of neurotrauma suggest that these compounds have the potential to offer a novel therapeutic approach and target both protection and regeneration. They lead to increased neuronal and glial survival, they can limit the damaging neuroinflammation and they can also protect neurites. Long chain omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have a complex pharmacodynamics, which leads potentially to the activation of a multitude of targets, including voltage and ligand-gated ion channels, transcription factors and G-protein coupled receptors. They can produce tissue-specific metabolites which have intrinsic activity, either on the same or on different cellular targets. The apparent large therapeutic window of omega-3 fatty acids is an advantage in the context of trauma, with patients in an unstable state, with multiple injuries. The specific use of omega-3 fatty acids in spinal cord injury and peripheral nerve injury will be discussed, focusing on issues which need to be addressed in order to translate successfully to the clinic the efficacy reported in the initial proof of concept animal studies.","omega3"

Previous studies support the idea that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-based pharmacological approach is a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of acute SCI. We postulated that a nanostructured material for controlled delivery of DHA at the lesion site may be well suited for this purpose. Toward this end, we prepare drug-loaded fibrous mats made of core-shell nanofibers by electrospinning, which contained a polylactic acid (PLA) shell for encapsulation of DHA within the core, for delivery of DHA in situ. In vitro study confirmed sustained DHA release from PLA/DHA core-shell nanofiber membrane (CSNM) for up to 36 days, which could significantly increase neurite outgrowth from primary cortical neurons in 3 days. This is supported by the upregulation of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) neural marker genes from qRT-PCR analysis. Most importantly, the sustained release of DHA could significantly increase the neurite outgrowth length from cortical neuron cells in 7 days when co-cultured with PLA/DHA CSNM, compared with cells cultured with 3 mu M DHA. From in vivo study with a SCI model created in rats, implantation of PLA/DHA CSNM could significantly improve neurological functions revealed by behavior assessment in comparison with the control (no treatment) and the PLA CSNM groups. According to histological analysis, PLA/DHA CSNM also effectively reduced neuron loss and increased serotonergic nerve sprouting. Taken together, the PLA/DHA CSNM may provide a nanostructured drug delivery system for DHA and contribute to neuroprotection and promoting neuroplasticity change following SCI.","omega3"

A meta-analysis was used to study the effect of DHA on the neurological recovery in the rat spinal cord injury model, and the relationship between the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury and the time and method of administration and the dose of DHA.Data source: Published studies on the effect of DHA on spinal cord injury animal models from seven databases were searched from their inception to January 2019, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases. The search terms included ""spinal cord injury"" ""docosahexaenoic acid"", and ""rats"".Data selection: Studies that evaluated the influence of DHA in rat models of spinal cord injury for locomotor functional recovery were included. The intervention group included any form of DHA treatment and the control group included treatment with normal saline, vehicle solution or no treatment. The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation's risk of bias assessment tool was used for the quality assessment of the included studies. Literature inclusion, quality evaluation and data extraction were performed by two researchers. Meta-analysis was then conducted on all studies that met the inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis was performed on the data using RevMan 5.1.2. software.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the score on the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. Secondary outcome measures were the sloping plate test, balance beam test, stair test and grid exploration test.Results: A total of 12 related studies were included, 3 of which were of higher quality and the remaining 9 were of lower quality. The highest mean Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score occurred at 42 days after DHA treatment in spinal cord injury rats. At 21 days after treatment, the mean difference in Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores between the DHA group and the control group was the most significant (pooled MD = 4.14; 95% CI = 3.58-4.70; P < 0.00001). In the subgroup analysis, improvement in the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score was more significant in rats administered DHA intravenously (pooled MD = 2.74; 95% CI = 1.41-4.07; P < 0.0001) and subcutaneously (pooled MD = 2.99; 95% CI = 2.29-3.69; P < 0.00001) than in the groups administered DHA orally (pooled MD = 3.04; 95% CI = -1.01 to 7.09; P = 0.14). Intravenous injection of DHA at 250 nmol/kg (pooled MD = 2.94; 95% CI = 2.47-3.41; P < 0.00001] and 1000 nmol/kg [pooled MD = 3.60; 95% CI = 2.66-4.54; P < 0.00001) significantly improved the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score in rats and promoted the recovery of motor function. Conclusion: DHA can promote motor functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rats. The administration of DHA by intravenous or subcutaneous injection is more effective than oral administration of DHA. Intravenous injection of DHA at doses of 250 nmol/kg or 1000 nmol/kg is beneficial. Because of the small number and the low quality of the included studies, more high-quality research is needed in future to substantiate the results.","omega3"

A multifactorial beneficial influence of omega-3 fatty acids on the health of humans and other mammals has been observed for many years. Therefore,omega-3 fatty acids and their function in the prophylaxis and treatment of various pathologies have been subjected to numerous studies. Regarding the documented therapeutic influence of omega-3 fatty acids on the nervous and immune systems, the aim of this paper is to present the current state of knowledge and the critical assessment of the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prophylaxis and treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) in rodent models. The prophylactic properties (pre-SCI) include the stabilization of neuron cell membranes, the reduction of the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and KC/GRO/CINC), the improvement of local blood flow, reduced eicosanoid production, activation of protective intracellular transcription pathways (dependent on RXR, PPAR-alpha, Akt, and CREB), and increased concentration of lipids, glycogen, and oligosaccharides by neurons. On the other hand, the therapeutic properties (post-SCI) include the increased production of endogenous antioxidants such as carnosine and homocarnosine, the maintenance of elevated GSH concentrations at the site of injury, reduced concentrations of oxidative stress marker (MDA), autophagy improvement (via increasing the expression of LC3-II), and p38 MAPK expression reduction in the superficial dorsal horns (limiting the sensation of neuropathic pain). Paradoxically, despite the well-documented protective activity of omega-3 acids in rodents with SCI, the research does not offer an answer to the principal question of the optimal dose and treatment duration. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing the role of multicenter rodent studies with the implementation of standards which initially may even be based on arbitrary criteria. Additionally, basing on available research data, the authors of this paper make a careful attempt at referring some of the conclusions to the human population.","omega3"

The contusion, performed without laminectomy and deriving from the pressure exerted directly on the bone, mimics more closely many features of spinal injury in humans. Spinal cord was injured at thoracic level 10 (T10) in adult anesthetized female CD1 mice, mounted on stereotaxic apparatus and connected to a precision impactor device. Following severe injury, we evaluated motor and sensory functions, and histological/morphological features of spinal tissue at different time points. Moreover, we studied the effects of early and subchronic administration of Docosahexaenoic acid, investigating functional responses, structural changes proximal and distal to the lesion in primary and secondary injury phases, proteome modulation in injured spinal cord. Docosahexaenoic acid was able i) to restore behavioural responses and ii) to induce pro-regenerative effects and neuroprotective action against demyelination, apoptosis and neuroinflammation. Considering the urgent health challenge represented by spinal injury, this new and reliable mouse model together with the positive effects of docosahexaenoic acid provide important translational implications for promising therapeutic approaches for spinal cord injuries.","omega3"

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects after hemisection and compression SCI and can directly affect microglia in these injury models. In rodent contusion SCI, we demonstrate that DHA (500 nmol/kg) administered acutely post-injury confers neuroprotection and enhances locomotor recovery, and also exerts a complex modulation of the microglial response to injury. In rodents, at 7 days after SCI, the level of phagocytosed myelin within Iba1-positive or P2Y12-positive cells was significantly lower after DHA treatment, and this occurred in parallel with an increase in intracellular miR-124 expression. Furthermore, intraspinal administration of a miR-124 inhibitor significantly reduced the DHA-induced decrease in myelin phagocytosis in mice at 7 days post-SCI. In rat spinal primary microglia cultures, DHA reduced the phagocytic response to myelin, which was associated with an increase in miR-124, but not miR-155. A similar response was observed in a microglia cell line (BV2) treated with DHA, and the effect was blocked by a miR-124 inhibitor. Furthermore, the phagocytic response of BV2 cells to stressed neurones was also reduced in the presence of DHA. In peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages, the expression of the M1, but not the M0 or M2 phenotype, was reduced by DHA, but the phagocytic activation was not altered. These findings show that DHA induces neuroprotection in contusion injury. Furthermore, the improved outcome is via a miR-124-dependent reduction in the phagocytic response of microglia.","omega3"

Primary neurons were isolated and cultured. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups and fed diets with different amounts of n-3 PUFAs. A model of spinal cord contusion was created at the T10 spinal segment and the composition of PUFAs was analyzed using gas chromatography. Spinal repair and motor function were evaluated postoperatively. Assessment of the effects of n-3 PUFAs on autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was performed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In vitro, n-3 PUFAs inhibited mTORC1 and enhanced autophagy. The n-3 PUFA levels and the ratio of n-3 PUFA to n-6 PUFA in the spinal cord and serum of rats fed a high-n-3 PUFA diet were higher before and after operation (P<0.05). Additionally, rats in the high-n-3 PUFA group showed improved motor function recovery, spinal cord repair-related protein expression level (MBP, Galc and GFAP). Expression levels if these protiens in the high-n-3 PUFA diet group expressed the highest levels, followed by the low-n-3 PUFA diet group and finally the control group (P<0.05). high-n-3 PUFA diet promoted autophagy ability and inhibited activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared with the low-n-3 PUFA diet group or the control group (P<0.05).

However, the precise molecular mechanism coupling n-3 PUFAs to neurorestorative responses is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) after contusive SCI and to investigate whether this protein plays a role in n-3 PUFA-mediated functional recovery post-SCI. We found that SCI resulted in a robust spinal cord up-regulation in FABP5 mRNA levels (556 +/- 187%) and protein expression (518 +/- 195%), when compared to sham-operated rats, at 7 days post-injury (dpi). This upregulation coincided with significant alterations in the metabolism of fatty acids in the injured spinal cord, as revealed by metabolomics-based lipid analyses. In particular, we found increased levels of the n-3 series PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22: 6 n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20: 5 n-3) at 7 dpi. Animals consuming a diet rich in DHA and EPA exhibited a significant upregulation in FABP5 mRNA levels at 7 dpi. Immunofluorescence showed low basal FABP5 immunoreactivity in spinal cord ventral gray matter NeuN(+) neurons of sham-operated rats. SCI resulted in a robust induction of FABP5 in glial (GFAP(+), APC(+), and NG2(+)) and precursor cells (DCX+, nestin(+)). We found that continuous intrathecal administration of FABP5 silencing with small interfering RNA (2 mu g) impaired spontaneous open-field locomotion post-SCI. Further, FABP5 siRNA administration hindered the beneficial effects of DHA to ameliorate functional recovery at 7 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggest that FABP5 may be an important player in the promotion of cellular uptake, transport, and/or metabolism of DHA post-SCI. Given the beneficial roles of n-3 PUFAs in ameliorating functional recovery, we propose that FABP5 is an important contributor to basic repair mechanisms in the injured spinal cord.","omega3"

Sprague-Dawley rats were fed rodent purified chows containing menhaden fish oil-derived LC-O3PUFAs for 8 weeks before being subjected to sham or spinal cord contusion surgeries. We show, through untargeted metabolomics, that dietary LC-O3PUFAs regulate important biochemical signatures associated with amino acid metabolism and free radical scavenging in both the injured and sham-operated spinal cord. Of particular significance, the spinal cord metabolome of animals fed with LC-O3PUFAs exhibited reduced glucose levels (-48 %) and polar uncharged/hydrophobic amino acids (less than -20 %) while showing significant increases in the levels of antioxidant/anti-inflammatory amino acids and peptides metabolites, including beta-alanine (+24 %), carnosine (+33 %), homocarnosine (+27 %), kynurenine (+88 %), when compared to animals receiving control diets (p < 0.05). Further, we found that dietary LC-O3PUFAs impacted the levels of neurotransmitters and the mitochondrial metabolism, as evidenced by significant increases in the levels of N-acetylglutamate (+43 %) and acetyl CoA levels (+27 %), respectively. Interestingly, this dietary intervention resulted in a global correction of the pro-oxidant metabolic profile that characterized the SCI-mediated sensorimotor dysfunction.

Untargeted metabolomic profiling was used to uncover metabolic changes and to identify relationships between metabolites and neurobehavioral functions in the spinal cord after injury in rats. In the early metabolic phase, neuronal signaling, stress, and inflammation-associated metabolites were strongly altered. A dynamic inflammatory response consisting of elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 and palmitoyl ethanolamide as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed. N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) were significantly decreased possibly reflecting neuronal cell death. A second metabolic phase was also seen, consistent with membrane remodeling and antioxidant defense response. These metabolomic changes were consistent with the pathology and progression of SCI. Several metabolites, including NAA, NAAG, and the omega-3 fatty acids docosapentaenoate and docosahexaenoate correlated greatly with the established Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotive score (BBB score). Our findings suggest the possibility of a biochemical basis for BBB score and illustrate that metabolites may correlate with neurobehavior. In particular the NAA level in the spinal cord might provide a meaningful biomarker that could help to determine the degree of injury severity and prognosticate neurologic recovery.","omega3"

Objective: To determine if DHA administration in addition to hypothermia, now standard care for neonatal asphyxial brain injury, attenuates post-HI damage and sensorimotor deficits. Methods: Seven-day-old (P7) rats underwent right carotid ligation followed by 90 min of 8% O-2 exposure. Fifteen minutes later, pups received injections of DHA 2.5 mg/kg (complexed to 25% albumin) or equal volumes of albumin. After a 1-hour recovery, pups were cooled (3 h, 30 degrees C). Sensorimotor and pathology outcomes were initially evaluated on P14. In subsequent experiments, sensorimotor function was evaluated on P14, P21, and P28; histopathology was assessed on P28. Results: At P14, left forepaw function scores (normal: 20/20) were near normal in DHA + hypothermia-treated animals (mean +/- SD 19.7 +/- 0.7 DHA + hypothermia vs. 12.7 +/- 3.5 albumin + hypothermia, p < 0.0001) and brain damage was reduced (mean +/- SD right hemisphere damage 38 +/- 17% with DHA + hypothermia vs. 56 +/- 15% with albumin + hypothermia, p = 0.003). Substantial improvements on three sensorimotor function measures and reduced brain damage were evident up to P28. Conclusion: Unlike post-HI treatment with DHA alone, treatment with DHA + hypothermia produced both sustained functional improvement and reduced brain damage after neonatal HI. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

In this study, we investigated the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation, as well as in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) injections, on long-term stroke outcomes. Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) before randomly assigned to four groups to receive the following: (1) low dose of n-3 PUFAs as the vehicle control, (2) intraperitoneal DHA injections, (3) n-3 PUFA dietary supplement, or (4) combined treatment of (2) and (3). Neurological deficits and brain atrophy, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and glial scar formation were assessed up to 28 days after MCAO. Results revealed that groups 2 and 3 showed only marginal reduction in post-stroke tissue loss and attenuation of cognitive deficits. Interestingly, group 4 exhibited significantly reduced tissue atrophy and improved cognitive functions compared to groups 2 and 3 with just a single treatment. Mechanistically, the combined treatment promoted post-stroke neurogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as reduced glial scar formation, all of which significantly correlated with the improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze. These results demonstrate an effective therapeutic regimen to enhance neurovascular restoration and long-term cognitive recovery in the mouse model of MCAO. Combined post-stroke DHA treatment and n-3 PUFA dietary supplementation thus may be a potential clinically translatable therapy for stroke or related brain disorders.","omega3"

Rats were fed with either control chow or chow enriched with x-3 PUFAs (750 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks before being subjected to a sham or a contusion SCI operation. We report new evidence showing that rats subjected to SCI after being pre-treated with a diet enriched with x-3 PUFAs exhibit significantly better functional outcomes. Pre-treated animals exhibited lower sensory deficits, autonomic bladder recovery, and early improvements in locomotion that persisted for at least 8 weeks after trauma. We found that SCI triggers a robust alteration in the cord PUFA neurolipidome, which was characterized by a marked docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency. This DHA deficiency was associated with dysfunction and corrected with the x-3 PUFA-enriched diet. Multivariate data analyses revealed that the spinal cord of animals consuming the x-3 PUFA-enriched diet had a fundamentally distinct neurolipidome, particularly increasing the levels of essential and long chain x-3 fatty acids and lysolipids at the expense of x-6 fatty acids and its metabolites. Altogether, dietary x-3 PUFAs prophylaxis confers resiliency to SCI mediated, at least in part, by generating a neuroprotective and restorative neurolipidome.","omega3"

Here we investigated the effects of an acute intravenous bolus of DHA delivered after SCI and characterized DHA-induced neuroplasticity within the adult injured spinal cord. We found robust sprouting of uninjured corticospinal and serotonergic fibers in a rat cervical hemisection SCI model. A mouse pyramidotomy model was used to confirm that this robust sprouting was not species or injury model specific. Furthermore, we demonstrated that corticospinal fibers sprouting to the denervated side of the cord following pyramidotomy contact V2a interneurons. We also demonstrated increased serotonin fibers and synaptophysin in direct contact with motor neurons. DHA also increased synaptophysin in rat cortical cell cultures. A reduction in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been shown to be involved in axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity. We showed that DHA significantly upregulates miR-21 and downregulates PTEN in corticospinal neurons. Downregulation of PTEN and upregulation of phosphorylated AKT by DHA were also seen in primary cortical neuron cultures and were accompanied by increased neurite outgrowth. In summary, acute DHA induces anatomical and synaptic plasticity in adult injured spinal cord. This study shows that DHA has therapeutic potential in cervical SCI and provides evidence that DHA could exert its beneficial effects in SCI via enhancement of neuroplasticity.","omega3"

We addressed the question whether the neuroprotective effect of these compounds after spinal cord injury could also be seen when their level is raised in tissues prophylactically, prior to injury. In this study we used transgenic fat-1 mice to examine whether enriching spinal cord tissue in endogenous omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has an effect on the outcome after compression spinal cord injury. The results demonstrate that after thoracic compression spinal cord injury, fat-1 mice display better locomotor recovery compared with the wild-type mice on a high omega-6 diet (high omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in tissues), and wild-type mice on a normal diet (controls). This is associated with a significant increase in neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival and a decrease in non-phosphorylated neurofilament loss. The protection from spinal cord injury in fat-1 mice was also correlated with a reduction in microglia/macrophage activation and in pro-inflammatory mediators. In vitro experiments in dorsal root ganglia primary sensory neurons further demonstrated that a fat-1 tissue background confers robust neuroprotection against a combined mechanical stretch and hypoxic injury. In conclusion, our studies support the hypothesis that a raised omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid level and an altered tissue omega-6/omega-3 ratio prior to injury leads to a much improved outcome after spinal cord injury.

The pathogenetic mechanisms associated with SCI include excitotoxicity, increased oxidation and inflammation. We review here our recent studies, which suggest that omega-3 PUFA have significant neuroprotective potential in spinal cord trauma. In a first study, we administered an intravenous bolus of a-linolenic acid (LNA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 30 min after spinal cord hemisection injury in adult rats. The omega-3 PUFA led to increased neuronal and glial survival, and a significantly improved neurological outcome. In subsequent studies, we tested DHA in a more severe compression model of SCI. We also explored a combined acute and chronic treatment regime using DHA. Saline or DHA was administered intravenously 30 min after compression of the spinal cord. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet for 6 weeks following injury. We assessed locomotor recovery and analysed markers for cell survival and axonal damage, and we also investigated the effects of the treatment on the inflammatory reaction and the oxidative stress that follow SCI. We showed that the acute DHA treatment is neuroprotective after compression SCI, even if the treatment is delayed up to an hour after injury. The DHA injection led to an increased neuronal and glial cell survival, and the effect of the DHA injection was amplified by addition of DHA to the diet. Rats treated with a DHA injection and a DHA-enriched diet performed significantly better at 6 weeks in terms of neurological outcome. The analysis of the tissue after DHA administration showed that the fatty acid significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and RNA/DNA oxidation, and the induction of COX-2. Parallel studies in a facial nerve injury model in mice also showed pro-regenerative effects of chronic dietary administration of DHA after nerve lesion. These observations suggest that treatment with omega-3 PUFA could represent a promising therapeutic approach in the management of neurological injury. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The understanding of remote damage-associated mechanisms has been mostly achieved in several models of focal brain injury such as the hemicerebellectomy (HCb) experimental paradigm, which helped to identify the involvement of many key players, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Currently, few interventions have been shown to successfully limit the progression of secondary damage events and there is still an unmet need for new therapeutic options. Given the emergence of the novel concept of resolution of inflammation, mediated by the newly identified omega 3-derived specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, such as resolvins, we reported a reduced ability of HCb-injured animals to produce resolvin D1 (RvD1) and an increased expression of its target receptor ALX/FPR2 in remote brain regions. The in vivo administration of RvD1 promoted functional recovery and neuroprotection by reducing the activation of Iba-1+ microglia and GFAP+ astrocytes as well as by impairing inflammatory-induced neuronal cell death in remote regions. These effects were counteracted by intracerebroventricular neutralization of ALX/FPR2, whose activation by RvD1 also down-regulated miR-146b- and miR-219a-1-dependent inflammatory markers. In conclusion, we propose that innovative therapies based on RvD1-ALX/FPR2 axis could be exploited to curtail remote damage and enable neuroprotective effects after acute focal brain damage.","omega3"

The present study examines whether this novel dietary strategy provides significant antinociceptive benefits in rats experiencing SCI-induced pain. Rats were fed control chow or chow enriched with O3PUFAs for 8 weeks before being subjected to sham or cord contusion surgeries, continuing the same diets after surgery for another 8 more weeks. The paw sensitivity to noxious heat was quantified for at least 8 weeks post-SCI using the Hargreaves test. We found that SCI rats consuming the preventive O3PUFA-enriched diet exhibited a significant reduction in thermal hyperalgesia compared to those consuming the normal diet. Functional neurometabolomic profiling revealed a distinctive deregulation in the metabolism of endocannabinoids (eCB) and related N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) at 8 weeks post-SCI. We found that O3PUFAs consumption led to a robust accumulation of novel NAE precursors, including the glycerophospho-containing docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (DPEA), and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The tissue levels of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the antihyperalgesic phenotype. In addition, rats consuming the O3PUFA-rich diet showed reduced sprouting of nociceptive fibers containing CGRP and dorsal horn neuron p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, well-established biomarkers of pain. The spinal cord levels of inositols were positively correlated with thermal hyperalgesia, supporting their role as biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain. Notably, the O3PUFA-rich dietary intervention reduced the levels of these metabolites. Collectively, these results demonstrate the prophylactic value of dietary O3PUFA against SCI-mediated chronic pain. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","omega3"

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in the onset and resolution of inflammation. Arachidonic acid (AA), an omega-6 PUFA, contributes to the initiation of inflammatory responses, whereas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 PUFA, has antiinflammatory effects. Therefore, decreasing AA and increasing DHA levels after SCI might be expected to attenuate inflammation after SCI and promote tissue protection and functional recovery. We show here that daily oral administration of fenretinide after spinal cord contusion injury led to a significant decrease in AA and an increase in DHA levels in plasma and injured spinal cord tissue. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in tissue damage and improvement in locomotor recovery. Fenretinide also reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes and the levels of oxidative stress markers after SCI. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated that fenretinide reduced TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) expression by reactive microglia. These results demonstrate that fenretinide treatment after SCI can reduce inflammation and tissue damage in the spinal cord and improve locomotor recovery. These beneficial effects may be mediated via the ability of fenretinide to modulate PUFA homeostasis.

Effective pharmacological treatments for SCI are not currently available. Maresin 1 (MaR1) is a highly conserved specialized proresolving mediator (SPM) hosting potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties with potent tissue regenerative actions. Here, we provide evidence that the inappropriate biosynthesis of SPM in the lesioned spinal cord hampers the resolution of inflammation and leads to deleterious consequences on neurological outcome in adult female mice. We report that, after spinal cord contusion injury in adult female mice, the biosynthesis of SPM is not induced in the lesion site up to 2 weeks after injury. Exogenous administration of MaR1, a highly conserved SPM, propagated inflammatory resolution after SCI, as revealed by accelerated clearance of neutrophils and a reduction in macrophage accumulation at the lesion site. In the search of mechanisms underlying the proresolving actions of MaR1 in SCI, we found that this SPM facilitated several hallmarks of resolution of inflammation, including reduction of proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3, CCL4, IL6, and CSF3), silencing of major inflammatory intracellular signaling cascades (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, p38, and ERK1/2), redirection of macrophage activation toward a prorepair phenotype, and increase of the phagocytic engulfment of neutrophils by macrophages. Interestingly, MaR1 administration improved locomotor recovery significantly and mitigated secondary injury progression in a clinical relevant model of SCI. These findings suggest that proresolution, immunoresolvent therapies constitute a novel approach to improving neurological recovery after acute SCI.","omega3"

The present study tested the hypothesis that this method is protective against controlled cortical impact (CCI). Indeed, mice fed with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-enriched diet for 2 months exhibited attenuated short and long-term behavioral deficits due to CCI. Although omega-3 PUFAs did not decrease cortical lesion volume, these fatty acids did protect against hippocampal neuronal loss after CCI and reduced pro-inflammatory response. Interestingly, omega-3 PUFAs prevented the loss of myelin basic protein (MPB), preserved the integrity of the myelin sheath, and maintained the nerve fiber conductivity in the CCI model. omega-3 PUFAs also directly protected oligodendrocyte cultures from excitotoxicity and blunted the microglial activation-induced death of oligodendrocytes in microglia/oligodendrocyte cocultures. In sum, omega-3 PUFAs elicit multifaceted protection against behavioral dysfunction, hippocampal neuronal loss, inflammation, and loss of myelination and impulse conductivity. The present report is the first demonstration that omega-3 PUFAs protect against white matter injury in vivo and in vitro. The protective impact of omega-3 PUFAs supports the clinical use of this dietary supplement as a prophylaxis against traumatic brain injury and other nervous system disorders.","omega3"

The long chain omega-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have significant biological effects. In particular, DHA is a major component of cell membranes in the brain. It is also involved in neurotransmission. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly devastating pathology that can lead to catastrophic dysfunction, with a significant reduction in the quality of life. Previous studies have shown that EPA and DHA can exert neuroprotective effects in SCI in mice and rats. The aim of this study was to analyze the mechanism of action of omega-3 PUFAs, such as DHA, in a mouse model of SCI, with a focus on the early pathophysiological processes.","omega3"

However, the mechanism of action underlying these effects has not been elucidated, and the optimum treatment regime remains to be defined. We have therefore carried out a detailed analysis of the effects of DHA in adult rats subject to thoracic compression SCI. Saline or DHA (250 nmol/kg) was administered intravenously (i.v.) 30 min after compression. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet for 1 or 6 weeks, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet (400mg/kg/day) for 1 or 6 weeks. Other groups received a DHA-enriched diet only for 1 week following injury, or received acute DHA (250 nmol/kg; i.v.) treatment delayed up to 3 h after injury. We also assessed oxidative stress and the inflammatory reaction at the injury site, neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival and axonal damage and the locomotor recovery. At 24 h, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, RNA/DNA oxidation and the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 were all significantly reduced by i.v. DHA administration. At 1 week and 6 weeks, macrophage recruitment was reduced and neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival was substantially increased. Axonal injury was reduced at 6 weeks. Locomotor recovery was improved from day 4, and sustained up to 6 weeks. Rats treated with a DHA-enriched diet in addition to the acute DHA injection were not significantly different from the acute DHA-treated animals at 1 week, but at 6 weeks showed additional improvements in both functional and histological outcomes. DHA treatment was ineffective if the acute injection was delayed until 3 h post-injury, or if the DHA was administered for 1 week solely by diet. Our results in a clinically relevant model of SCI show that significant neuroprotection can be obtained by combining an initial acute i.v. injection of DHA with a sustained dietary supplementation. Given that the safety and tolerability of preparations enriched in omega- 3 fatty acids is already well-documented, such a combined DHA treatment regime deserves consideration as a very promising approach to SCI management.","omega3"

Evidence suggests that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could target some of the pathological mechanisms that underlie damage after SCI. We examined the effects of treatment with PUFAs after lateral spinal cord hemisection in the rat. The omega-3 PUFAs alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) injected 30 min after injury induced significantly improved locomotor performance and neuroprotection, including decreased lesion size and apoptosis and increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival. Evidence showing a decrease in RNA/DNA oxidation suggests that the neuroprotective effect of omega-3 PUFAs involved a significant antioxidant function. In contrast, animals treated with arachidonic acid, an omega-6 PUFA, had a significantly worse outcome than controls. We confirmed the neuroprotective effect of omega-3 PUFAs by examining the effects of DHA treatment after spinal cord compression injury. Results indicated that DHA administered 30 min after spinal cord compression not only greatly increased survival of neurons but also resulted in significantly better locomotor performance for up to 6 weeks after injury.","omega3"

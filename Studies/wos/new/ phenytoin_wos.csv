After laminectomy, incomplete cord injury was produced by a weight-drop device, at the thoracic cord. Phenytoin was administrated intraperitoneally to half of the animals (group P). Neurological examinations with the BBB test followed. Pathological examinations followed animal's sacrifice. Group P animals achieved higher scores in all clinical tests. Overall comparison of control group and P group scores shows that P group animals achieved higher scores with a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Histopathological results showed that animals given phenytoin had less degenerative alterations at the injury site. The appearance of an astrocytic scar at the injury site, evident in animals given phenytoin, was combined with improved neurological scores. Phenytoin provided neuroprotective effect in rats with spinal cord injury by reducing the inflammation progress through inhibition of voltage gated sodium channels. Reduction of the degenerative procedure led to the development of an astrocytic matrix which provoked neuronal recovery.","phenytoin"

There is preclinical evidence to suggest that other anticonvulsants, such as sodium channel blockers, may also confer beneficial effects.PurposeThe aim of the current study was to determine if non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants were associated with neurological recovery after acute, traumatic spinal cord injury.MethodsThis was an observational cohort study using data from the Sygen clinical trial. The primary outcome was total motor score recovery in the first year after injury. Anticonvulsant use was extracted from concomitant medication records; individuals were classified based on early administration (within 30days of injury), or late/no administration. Motor recovery was compared using linear mixed effects regression models with a drug-by-time interaction, and adjustment for confounders. A secondary analysis incorporated a propensity score matched cohort.ResultsOf the cohort (n=570), 6% received anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, clonazepam, phenobarbital, and valproic acid) early after injury. After adjustments for initial injury level and severity, early exposure to non-gabapentinoid anticonvulsants was not associated with motor neurological outcomes (p=0.38 for all anticonvulsants, p=0.83 for sodium channel blockers, p=0.82 in propensity-matched cohort).ConclusionNon-gabapentinoid anticonvulsant exposure was not associated with greater or lesser neurological recovery. This suggests that these medications, as administered for the acute management of spinal cord injury, do not impact long-term neurological outcomes.","phenytoin"

Perfusion of the spinal cord in 0-Ca2+ Ringer solution resulted in significantly improved recovery of the compound action potential. Similarly, removal of Na+ from the perfusate resulted in significantly improved recovery of conduction in dorsal column axons. Exposure of the anoxic spinal cord to the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), the Na-Ca exchange blockers benzamil and bepridil, Na+-H+ exchange blockers amiloride and harmaline, and perfusion in Ringer solution with pH adjusted to 6.4, all resulted in improved recovery. The tertiary anesthetics procaine and lidocaine, as well as phenytoin and carbamazepine, also resulted in improved recovery of compound action potential amplitude after 60 min of anoxia. These results demonstrate that a significant component of irreversible loss of conduction, following anoxic injury of the dorsal columns, is Ca2+-dependent. Moreover, these results demonstrate that TTX-inhibitable Na+ channels participate in the pathophysiology of anoxic injury in spinal cord white matter, and indicate that reverse Na-Ca exchange provides a route for at least part of the damaging influx of Ca2+ into an intracellular compartment in anoxic spinal cord white matter. Our results also suggest that extracellular acidosis may have a protective effect on anoxic spinal cord white matter, and support the hypothesis that anoxic injury of spinal cord white matter may involve the Na+-H+ exchanger.","phenytoin"

Secondary injury following the primary impact includes a number of biochemical and cellular alterations leading to tissue necrosis and cell death. Influx of Na+ ions into cells has been Postulated to be a key early event in the pathogenesis of secondary traumatic and ischemic central nervous system injury. Previous studies have shown that some voltage-sensitive sodium channel blockers provide powerful neuroprotection. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neuroprotective effect of three sodium channel blockers-mexiletine, phenytoin and riluzole - after SCI. Ninety rats were randomly and blindly divided into five groups of 18 rats each: sham-operated group, trauma group (bolus injection of 1 mL physiological saline intraperiteonally [i.p.]), mexiletine treatment group (80 mg/kg, i.p.), plienytoin treatment group (200 mg/kg, i.p.) and riluzole treatment group (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats were killed for determination of spinal cord water content and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Motor function scores of six rats from each group were evaluated weekly for six weeks. Then the rats were killed for histopathological assessment. Although all the treatment groups revealed significantly lower MDA levels and spinal cord edema than the trauma group (p < 0.05), the riluzole and mexiletine treatment groups were better than the phenytoin treatment group. In the chronic stage, riluzole and mexiletine treatment achieved better results for neurobehavioral and histopathological recovery than phenytoin treatment. In conclusion, all the tested Na+ blockers had a neuroprotective effect after SCI; riluzole and mexiletine were superior to phenytoin. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","phenytoin"

In this study, we hypothesized that phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker, would result in protection of axons with concomitant improvement of functional recovery after SCI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent T9 contusion SCI after being fed normal chow or chow containing phenytoin; serum levels of phenytoin were within therapeutic range at the time of injury. At various timepoints after injury, quantitative assessment of lesion volumes, axonal degeneration, axonal conduction, and functional locomotor recovery were performed. When compared to controls, phenytoin-treated animals demonstrated reductions in the degree of destruction of gray and white matter surrounding the lesion epicenter, sparing of axons within the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) and dorsal column (DC) system rostral to the lesion site, and within the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) caudal to the lesion site, and enhanced axonal conduction across the lesion site. Improved performance in measures of skilled locomotor function was observed in pbenytoin-treated animals. Based on these results, we conclude that phenytoin provides neuroprotection and improves functional outcome after experimental SCI, and that it merits further examination as a potential treatment strategy in human SCI.

Increasingly, sex is recognized as an important biological variable in the development and treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, but much less is known about the role of sex in central neuropathic pain and its pharmacological inhibition. To test the hypothesis that efficacy of analgesic therapies differs between males and females in SCI, we used a mouse model of SCI pain to determine the analgesic efficacy of pioglitazone (PIO), U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of diabetes, and azithromycin (AZM), a commonly prescribed macrolide antibiotic with immunomodulatory properties. Male and female mice received moderate-severe T9 contusion SCI (75-kdyn). A robust heat hyperalgesia developed similarly between male and female mice by 4 weeks post-injury and lasted throughout the duration of the study (14 weeks). Three months after SCI, mice were treated with PIO (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or AZM (160 mg/kg, oral). We observed a sex-specific effect of PIO with significant antihyperalgesic effects in females, but not males. In contrast, AZM was effective in both sexes. Our data support the use of PIO and AZM as novel therapies for SCI pain and highlight the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in clinical and experimental SCI pain research.","pioglitazone"

We have compared the effectiveness of oral administration of these drugs, beginning at peak disease, at reducing ascending paralysis, motor deficits and demyelination in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice were immunized with an immunogenic peptide corresponding to amino acids 35-55 of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected with pertussis toxin to induce EAE. Unlike clozapine, quetiapine and tamoxifen, administration of pioglitazone beginning at peak disease decreased both clinical scores and lumbar white matter loss in EAE mice. Using kinematic gait analysis, we found that pioglitazone also maintained normal movement of the hip, knee and ankle joints for at least 44 days after MOG(35)(-)(55) immunization. This long-lasting preservation of hindleg joint movements was accompanied by reduced white matter loss, microglial and macrophage activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the lumbar spinal cords of EAE mice. These results support clinical findings that suggest pioglitazone may reduce the progressive loss of motor function in MS by decreasing inflammation and myelin damage.","pioglitazone"

Rats were subjected to laminectomy only; laminectomy with spinal cord contusion injury; laminectomy with contusion injury plus 30 mg/kg body weight methylprednisolone administered 5 min after surgery; or laminectomy with contusion injury plus 2 mg/kg body weight rosiglitazone administered intraperitoneally 5 min, 6 h and 24 h after surgery.

Acute treatment after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats is reported to suppress neuroinflammation, rescue injured tissues, and improve locomotor recovery. In the current study, we additionally assessed the protective efficacy of pioglitazone treatment on acute mitochondrial respiration, as well as functional and anatomical recovery after contusion SCI in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Mice received either vehicle or pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) at either 15 min or 3 h after injury (75 kdyn at T9) followed by a booster at 24 h post-injury. At 25 h, mitochondria were isolated from spinal cord segments centered on the injury epicenters and assessed for their respiratory capacity. Results showed significantly compromised mitochondrial respiration 25 h following SCI, but pioglitazone treatment that was initiated either at 15 min or 3 h post-injury significantly maintained mitochondrial respiration rates near sham levels. A second cohort of injured mice received pioglitazone at 15 min post injury, then once a day for 5 days post-injury to assess locomotor recovery and tissue sparing over 4 weeks. Compared to vehicle, pioglitazone treatment resulted in significantly greater recovery of hind-limb function over time, as determined by serial locomotor BMS assessments and both terminal BMS subscores and gridwalk performance. Such improvements correlated with significantly increased grey and white matter tissue sparing, although pioglitazone treatment did not abrogate long-term injury-induced inflammatory microglia/macrophage responses. In sum, pioglitazone significantly increased functional neuroprotection that was associated with remarkable maintenance of acute mitochondria! bioenergetics after traumatic SCI. This sets the stage for dose-response and delayed administration studies to maximize pioglitazone's efficacy for SCI while elucidating the precise role that mitochondria play in governing its neuroprotection; the ultimate goal to develop novel therapeutics that specifically target mitochondrial dysfunction.

Tribulations have been encountered along the way due to the complicated set of pathways that are initiated post-injury. To target this complicated multifaceted signaling cascade, the most promising therapeutics target multiple pathways involved in the secondary injury cascade, such as neuroinflammation, the generation of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. Compelling experimental data demonstrates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pivotal link in the neuropathological sequelae of brain injury. A group of PPAR agonists, specifically rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have shown an extreme amount of promise in the realm of drug discovery for CNS injury due to their ability to increase functional recovery and decrease lesion volumes following injury. The therapeutic effects of these PPAR agonists are thought to be a direct result of PPAR activity however new data is arising that shows some of the effects may be independent of PPAR activity, targeting a novel mitochondrial protein called mitoNEET. In this review, a thorough evaluation of the role of PPAR and mitoNEET in rosiglitazone and pioglitazone mediated neuroprotection will be completed in order to shed light on the mechanism of a new possible therapeutic intervention for CNS injury.","pioglitazone"

Synthetic PPAR gamma agonists (e.g. thiazolidinediones) are used to treat Type II diabetes and have the potential to limit the risk of developing brain injuries such as stroke by mitigating the influence of comorbidities. If brain injury develops, PPAR gamma serves as a master gatekeeper of cytoprotective stress responses, improving the chances of cellular survival and recovery of homeostatic equilibrium. In the acute injury phase, PPAR gamma directly restricts tissue damage by inhibiting the NFKI3 pathway to mitigate inflammation and stimulating the Nrf2/ARE axis to neutralize oxidative stress. During the chronic phase of acute brain injuries, PPAR gamma activation in injured cells culminates in the repair of gray and white matter, preservation of the blood brain barrier, reconstruction of the neurovascular unit, resolution of inflammation, and long-term functional recovery. Thus, PPAR gamma lies at the apex of cell fate decisions and exerts profound effects on the chronic progression of acute injury conditions. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of PPAR gamma in stroke and brain trauma and highlight the novel role of PPAR gamma in long-term tissue repair. We describe its structure and function and identify the genes that it targets. PPAR gamma regulation of inflammation, metabolism, cell fate (proliferation/differentiation/maturation/survival), and many other processes also has relevance to other neurological diseases. Therefore, PPAR gamma is an attractive target for therapies against a number of progressive neurological disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","pioglitazone"

Recently, we have demonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of RhoA and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition, another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-beta 42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signaling, although it may also regulate amyloid-beta 42 formation by direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex. The molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofen inhibits the RhoA signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is essential for coupling ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. Ibuprofen activates PPAR gamma in neuron-like PC12 and B104 cells. Activation of PPAR gamma with traditional agonists mimics the RhoA-inhibiting properties of ibuprofen in PC12 cells and, like ibuprofen, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. Protein knockdown with small interfering RNA specific for PPAR gamma blocks RhoA suppression of PPAR gamma agonists in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on RhoA activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective PPAR gamma inhibition. These findings support that PPAR gamma plays an essential role in mediating the RhoA-inhibiting effect of ibuprofen. Elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by RhoA activation, including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease.","pioglitazone"

Therefore, we examined the efficacy of the PPAR gamma agonist Pioglitazone in a rodent SCI model. Rats received a moderate mid-thoracic contusion and were randomly placed into groups receiving vehicle, low dose or high dose Pioglitazone. Drug or vehicle was injected i.p. at 15 min post-injury and then every 12 h for the first 7 days postinjury. Locomotor function was followed for 5 weeks using the BBB scale. BBB scores were greater in treated animals at 7 days post-injury and significant improvements in BBB subscores were noted, including better toe clearance, earlier stepping and more parallel paw position. Stereological measurements throughout the lesion revealed a significant increase in rostral spared white matter in both Pioglitazone treatment groups. Spinal cords from the high dose group also had significantly more gray matter sparing and motor neurons rostral and caudal to epicenter. Thus, our results reveal that clinical treatment with Pioglitazone, an FDA-approved drug used currently for diabetes, may be a feasible and promising strategy for promoting anatomical and functional repair after SCI.

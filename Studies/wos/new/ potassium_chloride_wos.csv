SCI models were established in SD rats. Five groups were set up randomly: normal control group, SCI 7-day (7D) model group, SCI 14-day (14D) model group, SCI-7D rTMS group and SCI-14D rTMS group (n=5 each). The rats in SCI rTMS groups were treated with 10 Hz rTMS from 8th day and 15th day after SCI respectively, once every day, 5 days every week, a total of 4 weeks. After the model establishment, motor recovery and spasticity alleviation were evaluated with BBB scale once a week till the end of treatment. Finally, different parts of tissues were dissected out for detection of variations of KCC2 protein using Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The results showed that the BBS scores after treatment were significantly higher in SCI-7D rTMS group than in SCI-14D rTMS group (P < 0.05). As compared with normal control groups, The KCC2 protein in SCI model groups was down-regulated after SCI, and the decrease was much more significant in SCI-14D model group than in SCI-7D group (P < 0.05). As compared with SCI model groups, KCC2 protein in rTMS groups was up-regulated after the treatment (P < 0.05). The up-regulation of KCC2 protein content and expression was more obvious in SCI-7D rTMS group than in SCI-14D rTMS group (P < 0.05). It was concluded that 10 Hz rTMS can alleviate spasticity in rats with SCI, which might be attributed to the up-regulation of KCC2 protein. It was also suggested that the high-frequency rTMS treatment after SCI at early stage might achieve more satisfactory curative effectiveness.","potassium_chloride"

The potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2, SLC12A5) is a key modulator of inhibitory GABAergic inputs in healthy adult neurons, as its chloride (Cl-) extruding activity underlies the hyperpolarizing reversal potential for GABA(A) receptor Cl- currents (E-GABA). Manipulation of KCC2 levels or activity improve symptoms associated with epilepsy and neuropathy. Recent works have now indicated that pharmacological enhancement of KCC2 function could reactivate dormant relay circuits in an injured mouse's spinal cord, leading to functional recovery and the attenuation of neuronal abnormality and disease phenotype associated with a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT). KCC2 interacts with Huntingtin and is downregulated in Huntington's disease (HD), which contributed to GABAergic excitation and memory deficits in the R6/2 mouse HD model. Here, these recent advances are highlighted, which attest to KCC2's growing potential as a therapeutic target for neuropathological conditions resulting from dysfunctional inhibitory input.","potassium_chloride"

However, the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of this molecule on sensitive fiber regeneration have never been studied. In order to fill this gap in our knowledge, we assessed the therapeutic potential of FK506 in a rat model of peripheral nerve repair. A 1-cm segment of left peroneal nerve was cut out and immediately autografted in an inverted position. After surgery, the animals were treated with FK506 (1.2 mg/kg/d) via an osmotic pump and compared to untreated animals. Recovery of use of the injured leg was assessed weekly for 12 weeks using a walking track apparatus and a camcorder. At the end of this period, motor and metabosensitive responses of the regenerated axons were recorded and histological analysis was performed. We observed that FK506 significantly: (1) increased the diameter of regenerated axons in the distal portion of the graft; (2) improved the responses of sensory neurons to metabolites such as potassium chloride and lactic acid; and (3) induced a fast-to-slow-fiber-type transition of the tibialis anterior muscle. Taken together, these data indicate that FK506 potentiates metabosensitive nerve fiber regeneration. Pharmacological studies of various dosages and concentrations of FK506 are required before recommending this drug for therapeutic treatment of nerve injuries.","potassium_chloride"

Interestingly, whereas animals experience impairments for several weeks, extraordinary plasticity mechanisms take place in the local microenvironment of the VN: newborn cells survive and acquire different phenotypes, such as microglia, astrocytes, or GABAergic neurons, whereas animals eventually recover completely from their lesion-induced deficits. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can modulate vestibular functional recovery and neurogenesis in mammals, in this study, we examined the effect of BDNF chronic intracerebroventricular infusion versus K252a (a Trk receptor antagonist) in our UVN model. Results showed that long-term intracerebroventricular infusion of BDNF accelerated the restoration of vestibular functions and significantly increased UVN-induced neurogenesis, whereas K252a blocked that effect and drastically delayed and prevented the complete restoration of vestibular functions. Further, because the level of excitability in the deafferented VN is correlated with behavioral recovery, we examined the state of neuronal excitability using two specific markers: the cation-chloride cotransporter KCC2 (which determines the hyperpolarizing action of GABA) and GABA(A) receptors. We report for the first time that, during an early time window after UVN, significant BDNF-dependent remodeling of excitability markers occurs in the brainstem. These data suggest that GABA acquires a transient depolarizing action during recovery from UVN, which potentiates the observed reactive neurogenesis and accelerates vestibular functional recovery. These findings suggest that BDNF and/or KCC2 could represent novel treatment strategies for vestibular pathologies.","potassium_chloride"

Of interest here is the regulation of serotonin (5-HT) receptors (R), glutamate receptor, metabotropic 1 (mGluR1), and potassium-chloride cotransporter (KCC2), which mediate motoneuron excitability, locomotor recovery, and spasticity posttransection. The examination of these genes in lumbar motoneurons posttransection has not been studied, which is necessary for developing potential pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring locomotion and/or reducing spasticity. Also, if activity is to be used to promote recovery or reduce spasticity postinjury, a further examination of neuromuscular activity on gene expression posttransection is warranted. The purpose of this study was to examine motoneuronal gene expression of 5-HT receptors, KCC2, and mGluR1 at 3 mo following a complete thoracic spinal cord transection, with and without the inclusion of daily passive cycling. Physiological hindlimb extensor and flexor motoneurons were differentially identified with two retrograde fluorescent tracers, allowing for the identification and separate harvesting of extensor and flexor motoneurons with laser capture microdissection and the subsequent examination of mRNA content using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We demonstrate that posttransection 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2CR, and mGluR1 expression was downregulated, whereas the 5-HT2AR was upregulated. These alterations in gene expression were observed in both flexor and extensor motoneurons, whereas passive cycling influenced gene expression in extensor but not flexor motoneurons. Passive cycling in extensor motoneurons further enhanced 5-HT2AR expression and increased 5-HT7R and KCC2 expression. Our results demonstrate that passive cycling influences serotonin receptor and KCC2 gene expression and that extensor motoneurons compared with flexor motoneurons may be more plastic to activity-based interventions posttransection.","potassium_chloride"

The purpose of the present study was to assess spinal cord circuit spasticity in post-stroke mice. At 3, 7, 21, and 42 d after photothrombotic ischemic cortical injury in C57BL/6J mice, we observed decreased rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann reflex (H reflex) in the affected forelimb of mice compared with the limbs of sham mice and the non-affected forelimb. This finding suggests a hyper-excitable stretch reflex in the affected forelimb. We then performed immunohistochemical and western blot analyses to examine the expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and phosphorylation of the KCC2 serine residue, 940 (S940), since this is the main chloride extruder that affects neuronal excitability. We also performed immunohistochemical analyses on the number of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1)-positive boutons to count the number of la afferent fibers that connect to motoneurons. Western bolts revealed that, compared with sham mice, experimental mice had significantly reduced KCC2 expression at 7 d post-stroke, and dephosphorylated S940 at 3 and 7 d post-stroke in motoneuron plasma membranes. We also observed a lower density of KCC2-positive areas in the plasma membrane of motoneurons at 3 and 7 d post-stroke. However, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that there were no differences between groups 21 and 42 d post-stroke, respectively. In addition, at 7 and 42 d post-stroke, experimental mice exhibited a significant increase in vGluT1 boutons compared with sham mice. Our findings suggest that both the down-regulation of KCC2 and increases in la afferent fibers are involved in post-stroke spasticity.","potassium_chloride"

Spasticity and allodynia are major sequelae that affect the quality of life and daily activities of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. Although rehabilitation ameliorates spasticity and allodynia, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain elusive. Objective. To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which rehabilitation ameliorates spasticity and allodynia after SCI in rats. Methods. The expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and potassium-chloride cotransporter-2 (KCC2), as well as the localization of KCC2, were examined in the lumbar enlargements of untrained and treadmill-trained thoracic SCI model rats. Spasticity and allodynia were determined via behavioral and electrophysiological analyses. The effects of BDNF on spasticity, allodynia, and KCC2 activation were determined by inhibition of BDNF signaling via intrathecal administration of TrkB-IgG. The effects of SCI and training on the expression levels of functional phospholipase C- in the lumbar enlargement were also examined. Results. Treadmill training after SCI upregulated endogenous BDNF expression and posttranslational modification of KCC2 in the lumbar enlargement significantly. There were also significant correlations between increased KCC2 expression and ameliorated spasticity and allodynia. Administration of TrkB-IgG abrogated the training-induced upregulation of KCC2 and beneficial effects on spasticity and allodynia. The expression level of functional phospholipase C- was reduced significantly after SCI, which may have contributed to the change in the function of BDNF, whereby it did not trigger short-term downregulation or induce long-term upregulation of KCC2 expression secondary to training. Conclusions. BDNF-mediated restoration of KCC2 expression underlies the suppression of spasticity and allodynia caused by rehabilitation.","potassium_chloride"

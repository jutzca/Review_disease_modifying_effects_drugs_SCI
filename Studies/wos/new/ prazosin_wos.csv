This study evaluates the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 147) were fasted for 16 h and had the left jugular vein cannulated followed by laminectomy or laminectomy + complete SCT between T-4 and T-5 vertebrae. The next day, a test meal (1.5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0.5 mg/ml in 5% glucose) was administered by gavage feeding and 10 min later cervical dislocation was performed. Dye recovery in the stomach, and proximal, mid and distal small intestine was determined by spectrophotometry. SCT inhibited GE and GI transit since it increased gastric recovery by 71.3% and decreased mid small intestine recovery by 100% (P < 0.05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy + section of the splanchnic nerves, i.v. hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) prevented the development of the SCT effect on GE and GI transit. Pretreatment with i.v. naloxone (3, mg/kg), L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was ineffective. Bilateral adrenalectomy or guanethidine (10 mg/kg) increased the magnitude of the GE inhibition, while i.v. prazosin (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the magnitude but did not abolish the GE inhibition. In summary, the inhibition of GI motility observed 1 day after thoracic SCT in awake rats seems to involve vagal and possibly splanchnic pathways. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

"2",83,"H Kakizaki, MO Fraser, WC De","Reflex pathways controlling urethral striated and smooth muscle function in the male rat",1997,"American Journal Of Physiology-Regulatory Integrative And Comparative Physiology","Amer Physiological Soc",NA,NA,1,"2021-01-15 16:57:31","Article",NA,"0363-6119",NA,272,5,NA,NA,83,3.46,28,3,24,"The organization of vesicourethral reflex mechanisms in the male rat was studied by monitoring intraurethral pressure and the external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyogram. EUS striated and urethral smooth muscle activities were elicited by reflex isovolumetric bladder contractions evoked by bladder filling or electrical stimulation of nerves in the bladder wall. Evoked EUS bursting activity in normal rats was eliminated in chronic spinal rats and replaced by tonic activity. Reflex urethral smooth muscle activity mediated by an increase in urethral pressure after paralysis of the EUS with alpha-bungarotoxin occurred in normal and chronic spinal rats. The response was significantly larger in chronic spinal (21.3+/-3.0 cmH(2)O) than in normal rats (4.2+/-0.7 cmH(2)O). N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 20 mg/kg iv) increased the smooth muscle response in normal (5.9+/-1.3 cmH(2)O) and chronic spinal rats (6.9+/-1.8 cmH(2)O). This increase in urethral pressure was not changed by sympathetic nerve transection or prazosin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg iv) but was abolished by hexamethonium and reduced 74-89% by atropine. These results indicate that coordinated EUS function (bursting activity) in the male rat is dependent on supraspinal pathways and that the urethral smooth muscle response during voiding is composed of a predominant cholinergic, atropine-sensitive contraction as well as a nitric oxide-mediated relaxation. Both are mediated by activation of parasympathetic pathways and are maintained or significantly larger after spinal cord injury, indicating that they are dependent on spinal reflex pathways.","prazosin"

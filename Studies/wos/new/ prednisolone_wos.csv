In the first, trauma events deliver direct pressure to the cervical spine, which may compress, dislocate, or fracture the spine, and in turn compress, crush, or transect the spinal cord. In the process, local neurons are destroyed and sensory and motor pathways can be severed. In the second phase, acute tissue responses, bleeding, and inflammation rapidly and radically change the physical and chemical conditions at the wound site. Finally, days, weeks, and months after the initial trauma, chronic post-injury processes reform the wound site into a lasting scar that impedes regeneration of spinal cord pathways. A major goal of current spinal cord injury research should be rapid and lasting inhibition of acute and chronic tissue reactions in the spinal cord wound that lead to a growth-inhibiting environment and diverting these reactions toward conditions that favor regeneration of severed spinal pathways. Here, we consider experimental strategies that could form the basis for treatments that can be rapidly administered after trauma and provides lasting benefit to spinal cord regeneration and rehabilitation.","prednisolone"

Normally, acute injury leads to chronic injury in the spinal cord, although this has a variable impact on normal sensory and motor functions. Currently the only drug used to treat acute spinal cord injury is methyl-prednisolone, administered in order to prevent secondary inflammatory neural damage. Thus, it is time that alternative and complementary pharmacological, cell and gene therapies be developed. In order to achieve this, several approaches to stimulate spinal cord repair must be considered. Indeed, the main lines of research that have been established in different animal models of spinal cord regeneration are now beginning to produce encouraging results. Several patents have been derived from these studies and hopefully, they will lead to the development of new treatments for human spinal cord injuries. Here is presented a review of the main patents that have been generated by this research, and that can be classified as:","prednisolone"

Guanabenz acetate was administered twice daily for 8 weeks. In the first group, the treatment significantly increased blood flow in the abdominal aorta. All cats treated with guanabenz acetate 3 hr after spinal cord contusion had return of micturition and none suffered complete paraplegia. Four animals had partial and the other four had complete motor recovery. A superoxide (O2-.) generating system, horseradish peroxidase, decreased [C-14]gamma amino butyric acid uptake by mouse cortical slices by 33% but when superoxide dismutase was added to the medium, the uptake was reduced by only 9%. The nerve endings were also protected by superoxide dismutase from morphologic damage by O2-. as observed by electron microscopy. The agents used in these studies produce their ameliorating effects by virtue of their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and membrane stabilizing properties, and enhancing the regional microcirculation. In addition to having these properties, guanabenz acetate is also an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist.","prednisolone"

However, the mechanism remains unclear. Thus, we established a rat model of acute spinal cord injury using a modified version of Allen's method. Jisuikang (50, 25, and 12.5 g/kg/d) and prednisolone were administered 30 minutes after anesthesia. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale scores and the oblique board test showed improved motor function recovery in the prednisone group and moderate-dose Jisuikang group compared with the other groups at 3-7 days post-injury. The rats in the moderate-dose Jisuikang group recovered best at 14 days post-injury. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that the survival rate of neurons in treatment groups increased after 3-7 days of administration. Further, the structure of neurons and glial cells was more distinct, especially in prednisolone and moderate-dose Jisuikang groups. Western blot assay and immunohistochemistry showed that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in injured segments was maintained at a high level after 7-14 days of treatment. In contrast, expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was down-regulated at 7 days after spinal cord injury. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of BDNF and NGF mRNA was induced in injured segments by prednisolone and Jisuikang. At 3-7 days after injury, the effect of prednisolone was greater, while 14 days after injury, the effect of moderate-dose Jisuikang was greater. These results confirm that Jisuikang can upregulate BDNF and NGF expression for a prolonged period after spinal cord injury and promote repair of acute spinal cord injury, with its effect being similar to prednisolone.","prednisolone"

However, side effects combined with a limited efficacy in clinical trials have restricted their usefulness for treatment of SCI patients. Recent studies have shown that incorporation of the nitric oxide releasing moiety into the glucocorticoid structure enhances anti-inflammatory properties and reduces side effects. One compound, a derivative of prednisolone (PRE), (NCX 1015, prednisolone 21 [(4'nitrooxymethyl)benzoate]), has interesting pharmacological properties. Therefore, we investigated its effects on apoptosis and recovery of function in rats after SCI. Rats received subcutaneously vehicle, NCX 1015 or PRE (37 mu mol/kg, each) 3.5 h after a standardized thoracic lesion. The treatment was continued once a day for 3 days and the effect of both steroids on apoptosis was examined by immunohistochemistry 24 h after the last injection. NCX 1015 but not PRE reduced TUNEL and activated caspase 3 in both white and ventral gray matter as well as tumor necrosis factor immunoreactivity in ventral horn motorneurons, suggesting that NCX 1015 reduces SCI-induced apoptosis. The effect of NCX 1015 on motor function was then examined by a standard locomotion rating scale (BBB) starting at 1 day after injury and continuing up to 14 days. NCX 1015 improved significantly locomotor activity by 4 days after injury, whereas PRE had an effect equivalent to that of vehicle, thus providing a correlation between the antiapoptotic effect of NCX1015 and its ability to improve recovery of function. The data suggest that NCX 1015 might be a novel experimental therapeutic compound for recovery of function in SCI patients. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","prednisolone"

However, the effects of MP on the functional recovery after a SCI is controversial. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of MP on the recovery of neural conduction following a SCI. A SCI was produced using the NYU spinal cord impactor. A behavioral test was conducted to measure neurological disorders, and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded. According to the behavioral test, using BBB locomotor scaling, MP-treated animals showed improved functional recoveries when compared to saline-treated animals. MEP latencies in the MP-treated group were shortened when compared to those in the control group. Peak amplitudes of MEPs were larger in the MP-treated group than those in the control group. The thresholds of MEPs tended to be lower in the MP-treated group than those in the control group. These results suggest that MP may improve functional recovery after a SCI.","prednisolone"

This study investigated the potential role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and microglia in the migration of human Muller glia with neural stem cell characteristics following subretinal injection into the Lister hooded (LH) and Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat retinae. Neonate LH rat retina showed minimal baseline microglial accumulation (CD68-positive cells) that increased significantly 2 weeks after transplantation (p <.001), particularly in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer. In contrast, nontransplanted 5-week-old RCS rat retina showed considerable baseline microglial accumulation in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor outer segment debris zone (DZ) that further increased (p <.05) throughout the retina 2 weeks after transplantation. Marked deposition of the N-terminal fragment of CSPGs, as well as neurocan and versican, was observed in the DZ of 5-week-old RCS rat retinae, which contrasted with the limited expression of these proteins in the GCL of the adult and neonate LH rat retinae. Staining for CSPGs and CD68 revealed colocalization of these two molecules in cells infiltrating the ONL and DZ of the degenerating RCS rat retina. Enhanced immune suppression with oral prednisolone and intraperitoneal injections of indomethacin caused a reduction in the number of microglia but did not facilitate Muller stem cell migration. However, injection of cells with chondroitinase ABC combined with enhanced immune suppression caused a dramatic increase in the migration of Muller stem cells into all the retinal cell layers. These observations suggest that both microglia and CSPGs constitute a barrier for stem cell migration following transplantation into experimental models of retinal degeneration and that control of matrix deposition and the innate microglial response to neural retina degeneration may need to be addressed when translating cell-based therapies to treat human retinal disease.","prednisolone"

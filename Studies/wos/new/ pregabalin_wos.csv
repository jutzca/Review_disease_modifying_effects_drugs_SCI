While the development of novel compounds or cell-based interventions for spinal cord injury is unquestionably worthwhile, a complementary approach examines current standards of care and the degree to which these can be optimized to benefit long-term neurological function. Numerous classes of drugs, already in use in the acute phase of spinal cord injury, are intriguing because they (1) readily cross the blood-spinal cord barrier to modulate activity in the central nervous system and (2) are administered during a window of time in which neuroprotection, and even some repair, are feasible. Here, we review a rare case of convergent lines of evidence from both preclinical and human studies to support the early administration of a class of drug (ie, gabapentinoids) to both foster motor recovery and reduce the severity of neuropathic pain.","pregabalin"

Increasingly, sex is recognized as an important biological variable in the development and treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, but much less is known about the role of sex in central neuropathic pain and its pharmacological inhibition. To test the hypothesis that efficacy of analgesic therapies differs between males and females in SCI, we used a mouse model of SCI pain to determine the analgesic efficacy of pioglitazone (PIO), U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of diabetes, and azithromycin (AZM), a commonly prescribed macrolide antibiotic with immunomodulatory properties. Male and female mice received moderate-severe T9 contusion SCI (75-kdyn). A robust heat hyperalgesia developed similarly between male and female mice by 4 weeks post-injury and lasted throughout the duration of the study (14 weeks). Three months after SCI, mice were treated with PIO (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or AZM (160 mg/kg, oral). We observed a sex-specific effect of PIO with significant antihyperalgesic effects in females, but not males. In contrast, AZM was effective in both sexes. Our data support the use of PIO and AZM as novel therapies for SCI pain and highlight the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in clinical and experimental SCI pain research.","pregabalin"

Here, we found that the alpha 2 delta 2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels negatively regulates axon growth and regeneration of corticospinal neurons, the cells that originate the corticospinal tract. Increased alpha 2 delta 2 expression in corticospinal neurons contributed to loss of corticospinal regrowth ability during postnatal development and after SCI. In contrast, alpha 2 delta 2 pharmacological blockade through gabapentin administration promoted corticospinal structural plasticity and regeneration in adulthood. Using an optogenetic strategy combined with in vivo electrophysiological recording, we demonstrated that regenerating corticospinal axons functionally integrate into spinal circuits. Mice administered gabapentin recovered upper extremity function after cervical SCI. Importantly, such recovery relies on reorganization of the corticospinal pathway, as chemogenetic silencing of injured corticospinal neurons transiently abrogated recovery. Thus, targeting alpha 2 delta 2 with a clinically relevant treatment strategy aids repair of motor circuits after SCI.","pregabalin"

Approximately 60% of patients suffering from acute spinal cord injury (SCI) develop pain within days to weeks after injury, which ultimately persists into chronic stages. To date, the consequences of pain after SCI have been largely examined in terms of interfering with quality of life. Objective. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pain and pain management on neurological recovery after SCI. Methods. We analyzed clinical data in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study in patients with SCI. Using mixed effects regression techniques, total motor and sensory scores were modelled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results. A total of 225 individuals were included in the study (mean age: 45.8 +/- 18 years, 80% male). At 1 month postinjury, 28% of individuals with SCI reported at- or below-level neuropathic pain. While pain classification showed no effect on neurological outcomes, individuals administered anticonvulsant medications at 1 month postinjury showed significant reductions in pain intensity (2 points over 1 year; P < .05) and greater recovery in total motor scores (7.3 points over 1 year; P < .05). This drug effect on motor recovery remained significant after adjustment for injury level and injury severity, pain classification, and pain intensity. Conclusion. While initial pain classification and intensity did not reveal an effect on motor recovery following acute SCI, anticonvulsants conferred a significant beneficial effect on motor outcomes. Early intervention with anticonvulsants may have effects beyond pain management and warrant further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in human SCI.","pregabalin"

In the present study, we examined their effects on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice subjected to weight-drop spinal cord injury. Hindlimb motor function and mechanical hypersensitivity were evaluated using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and the von Frey test, respectively, for 4 weeks after spinal cord injury. Despite gradual recovery of hindlimb motor function after spinal cord injury, mice exhibited continuous development of mechanical hypersensitivity. Gabapentin (30 and 100 mg/kg) and pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally on the 28th day after spinal cord injury, reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that gabapentin and pregabalin could be useful therapeutic tools for patients with neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mixed-effects regression techniques were used to model total motor scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post injury. We found that early (not late) administration of anticonvulsants significantly improved motor recovery (6.25 points over 1 year). The beneficial effect of anticonvulsants remained significant after adjustment for differences in 1-month motor scores and injury characteristics. A review of a subset of patients revealed that gabapentinoids were the most frequently administrated anticonvulsant. Together with preclinical findings, intervention with anticonvulsants represents a potential pharmacological strategy to improve motor function after SCI.","pregabalin"

Allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transplanted intravenously (IV group) or intralesionally (IL group) at post-injury 1 day in rats. Behavioral improvement, engraftment and differentiation of the transplanted cells and the expression of neurotrophic factors of the transplanted groups were analyzed and compared with those of the control group. At 6 weeks post-injury, the mean BBB motor scales in the control, IV and IL groups were 6.5 +/- 1.8, 11.1 +/- 2.1, and 8.5 +/- 2.8, respectively. Regardless of the delivery route, the MSCs transplantation following spinal cord injuries presented better behavioral improvement. The differentiations of the engrafted cells were different according to the delivery routes. The engrafted cells predominantly differentiated into astrocytes in the IV group and on the other hand, engrafted cells of the IL group demonstrated relatively even neural and glial differentiation. The expressions of neuronal growth factor were significantly higher in the IL group (mean relative optical density, 2.4 +/- 0.15) than those in the control (2.16 +/- 0.04) or IV group (1.7 +/- 0.23). Transplantation of MSCs in the early stage of spinal cord injury gives a significant clinical improvement. However, the fate of the transplanted MSCs and expression of neuronal growth factors are different along the transplantation route.","pregabalin"

The authors examined the neuroprotective effect of pregabalin (GP) which is known as to reduce glutamate secretion, in a rat model of spinal cord injury. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four groups; the control group (contusion injury only), the methylprednisolone treated group, the minocycline treated group and the GP treated group. Spinal cord injury was produced by contusion using the New York University impactor (25 g-cm, at the 9th-10th thoracic). Functional evaluations were done using the inclined plane test and a motor rating scale. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling staining technique (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining of cord tissues obtained at 7 days post-injury. Pregabalin treated animals showed significantly better functional recovery, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Mean numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the respective groups were 63.5 +/- 7.4, 53.6 +/- 4.0, 44.2 +/- 3.9 and 36.5 +/- 3.6. Double staining (TUNEL and anti-CC1) for oligodendrocyte apoptosis, was used to calculate oligodendrocyte apoptotic indexes (AI), using the following formula AI = (No. of doubly stained cells/No. of anti-CC1 positive cells) x 100. Mean group AIs were 88.6, 46.7, 82.1 and 70.3%, respectively. Mean numbers of activated microglia (anti-OX-42 positive cells) in high power fields were 29.8 +/- 3.9, 22.7 +/- 4.1, 21.0 +/- 3.9 and 17.8 +/- 4.3, respectively. This experiment demonstrates that GP can act as a neuroprotector after SCI in rats, and its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects are related to its neuroprotective effect. Further studies are needed to unveil the specific mechanism involved at the receptor level.","pregabalin"

Cacna2d2 gene deletion or silencing promoted axon growth in vitro. In vivo, Alpha2delta2 pharmacological blockade through Pregabalin (PGB) administration enhanced axon regeneration in adult mice after spinal cord injury (SCI). As PGB is already an established treatment for a wide range of neurological disorders, our findings suggest that targeting Alpha2delta2 may be a novel treatment strategy to promote structural plasticity and regeneration following CNS trauma.","pregabalin"

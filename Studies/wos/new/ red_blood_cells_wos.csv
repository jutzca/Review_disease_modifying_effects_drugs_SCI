Identifying stable and specific oxidative biomarkers is of important significance for studying spinal cord injury-associated secondary injury. Mature erythrocytes do not contain nuclei and mitochondria and cannot be transcribed and translated. Therefore, mature erythrocytes are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and may become a valuable biomarker. In the present study, we revealed the proteome dynamics of protein expression in erythrocytes of beagle dogs in the acute and subacute phases of spinal cord injury using mass spectrometry-based approaches. We found 26 proteins that were differentially expressed in the acute (0-3 days) and subacute (7-21 days) phases of spinal cord injury. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins were involved in glutathione metabolism, lipid metabolism, and pentose phosphate and other oxidative stress pathways. Western blot assays validated the differential expression of glutathione synthetase, transaldolase, and myeloperoxidase. This result was consistent with mass spectrometry results, suggesting that erythrocytes can be used as a novel sample source of biological markers of oxidative stress in spinal cord injury. Glutathione synthetase, transaldolase, and myeloperoxidase sourced from erythrocytes are potential biomarkers of oxidative stress after spinal cord injury. This study was approved by the Experimental Animal Centre of Ningxia Medical University, China (approval No. 2017-073) on February 13, 2017.","red_blood_cells"

Confocal Raman Microspectral Imaging (in combination with multivariate analysis) was adopted to illustrate the underlying biochemical mechanisms of LLLT treatment on a SCI rat model. Methods: Using transversal tissue sections, the Raman spectra can identify areas neighboring the injury site, glial scar, cavity, and unharmed white matter, as well as their correlated cellular alterations, such as demyelination and up-regulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Multivariate data analysis methods are used to depict the underlying therapeutic effects by highlighting the detailed content and distribution variations of the biochemical constituents. Results: It is confirmed that photon-tissue interactions might lead to a decay of the inhibitory response to remyelination by suppressing CSPG expression, as also morphologically demonstrated by reduced glial scar and cavity areas. An inter-group comparison semi-quantitatively confirms changes in lipids, phosphatidic acid, CSPGs, and cholesterol during SCI and its LLLT treatment, paving the way for in vitro and in vivo understanding of the biochemical changes accompanying pathobiological SCI events. Conclusion: The achieved results in this work not only have once again proved the well-known cellular mechanisms of SCI, but further illustrate the underlying biochemical variability during LLLT treatment, which provide a sound basis for developing real-time Raman methodologies to monitor the efficacy of the SCI LLLT treatment.

Recently, there is increasing interest in tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic drug, which can reduce the bleeding volume after physical trauma. However, the efficacy of TXA on the pathology of SCI remains unknown.MethodsAfter producing a contusion SCI at the thoracic level of mice, TXA was intraperitoneally administered and the bleeding volume in the lesion area was quantified. Tissue damage was evaluated by immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses. Since heme is one of the degraded products of red blood cells (RBCs) and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), we examined the influence of heme on the pathology of SCI. Functional recovery was assessed using the open field motor score, a foot print analysis, a grid walk test, and a novel kinematic analysis system. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, Dunnett's test, and an ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test.ResultsAfter SCI, the intralesional bleeding volume was correlated with the heme content and the demyelinated area at the lesion site, which were significantly reduced by the administration of TXA. In the injured spinal cord, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is a DAMP receptor, was predominantly expressed in microglial cells. Heme stimulation increased TLR4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression levels in primary microglial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly to the in vitro experiments, the injection of non-lysed RBCs had little pathological influence on the spinal cord, whereas the injection of lysed RBCs or heme solution significantly upregulated the TLR4 and TNF expression in microglial cells. In TXA-treated SCI mice, the decreased expressions of TLR4 and TNF were observed at the lesion sites, accompanied by a significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells and better functional recovery in comparison to saline-treated control mice.ConclusionThe administration of TXA ameliorated the intralesional cytotoxicity both by reducing the intralesional bleeding volume and preventing heme induction of the TLR4/TNF axis in the SCI lesion. Our findings suggest that TXA treatment may be a therapeutic option for acute-phase SCI.","red_blood_cells"

Prior work has shown that this nociceptive input can expand the area of tissue damage (secondary injury), undermine behavioral recovery, and enhance the development of chronic pain. Here, it is shown that nociceptive input given a day after a lower thoracic contusion injury in rats enhances the infiltration of red blood cells at the site of injury, producing an area of hemorrhage that expands secondary injury. Peripheral nociceptive fibers were engaged 24 h after injury by means of electrical stimulation (shock) applied at an intensity that engages unmyelinated pain (C) fibers or through the application of the irritant capsaicin. Convergent western immunoblot and cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric assays showed that both forms of stimulation increased the concentration of hemoglobin at the site of injury, with a robust effect observed 3-24 h after stimulation. Histopathology confirmed that shock treatment increased the area of hemorrhage and the infiltration of red blood cells. SCI can lead to hemorrhage by engaging the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel complex in neurovascular endothelial cells, which leads to cell death and capillary fragmentation. Histopathology confirmed that areas of hemorrhage showed capillary fragmentation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the SUR1-TRPM4 complex showed that it was up-regulated by noxious stimulation. Shock-induced hemorrhage was associated with an acute disruption in locomotor performance. These results imply that noxious stimulation impairs long-term recovery because it amplifies the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and the infiltration of red blood cells, which expands the area of secondary injury.","red_blood_cells"

The effect of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or the cytokine fms-like thyrosin kinase 3 (Flt3) ligand on functional outcome and tissue regeneration was studied in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods. Rats with a balloon-induced compression lesion were injected with G-CSF and/or Flt3 ligand to mobilize bone marrow cells. Behavioral tests (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan and plantar test), blood counts, morphometric evaluation of the white and gray matter, and histology were performed 5 weeks after SCI. Results. The mobilization of bone marrow cells by G-CSF, Flt3 ligand and their combination improved the motor and sensory performance of rats with SCI, reduced glial scarring, increased axonal sprouting and spared white and gray matter in the lesion. The best results were obtained with a combination of G-CSF and Flt3. G-CSF alone or in combination with Flt3 ligand significantly increased the number of white blood cells, but not red blood cells or hemoglobin content, during and after the time-course of bone marrow stimulation. The combination of factors led to infiltration of the lesion by CD11b(+) cells. Conclusions. The observed improvement in behavioral and morphologic parameters and tissue regeneration in animals with SCI treated with a combination of both factors could be associated with a prolonged time-course of mobilization of bone marrow cells. The intravenous administration of G-CSF and/or Flt3 ligand represents a safe and effective treatment modality for SCI.","red_blood_cells"

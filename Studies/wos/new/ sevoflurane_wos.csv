A 52-year-old man treated with oral dantrolene for spasticity after spinal cord injury was scheduled to undergo irrigation and drainage of a thigh abscess under general anesthesia. He had taken 50 mg oral dantrolene per day for 3 years. Under standard neuromuscular monitoring, anesthesia was performed with propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of ED95 (0.3 mg/kg) of rocuronium could not depress T1 up to 95%. An additional dose of rocuronium depressed T1 completely and decreased the train-of-four (TOF) count to zero. There was no apparent prolongation of the neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium. The TOF ratio was recovered to more than 0.9 within 40 minutes after the last dose of rocuronium. A small dose of oral dantrolene does not prolong the duration of action and recovery of rocuronium.","sevoflurane"

The developing secondary complications of tSCI may result in further chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Sevoflurane preconditioning (SF-PreCon) has shown guaranteed protective effects in myocardial or cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. However, the role of SF-PreCon in tSCI still remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that SF-PreCon ameliorated the developing secondary complications through reducing the apoptosis rate and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in injured spinal cord tissues, and therefore enhancing the recovery after tSCI. Notably, we demonstrated that SF-PreCon ameliorates tSCI through inhibiting Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). Importantly, we verified that SF-PreCon inhibits the expression of COX-2 and reduces the apoptosis rate after tSCI via the induction of Caveolin-3 (Cav-3). Taken together, our results suggest that SF-PreCon ameliorates tSCI via Cav-3-dependent COX-2 inhibition and provide an economical and practical method against the secondary injury after tSCI.","sevoflurane"

Six adult minipigs weighing 32-35 kg were narcotized by thiopental, intubated, and placed on a volume-cycled ventilator. Anaesthesia was maintained by 1.5% sevoflurane with oxygen. Following location of the 1st lumbar vertebra animals were fastened in an immobilization frame. The spinal cord, exposed through a laminectomy, was compressed by a 5 mm thick circular rod with a peak force of 0.8 kg at a velocity of 3 cm.s(-1). The next day the minipigs were paraplegic but improved rapidly to paraparesis. On the 12th postoperative day they were euthanasied. Neural tissue changes were evaluated by post mortem MRI, which showed damage to the spinal cord white and/or gray matter in the epicentre of compression with longitudinal spreading over one segment cranially and caudally. Statistical analyses performed by Spearman's rho test revealed positive correlations between damaged areas and the whole area of the spinal cord white/gray matter (P = 0.047; r(s) = 0.742) and (P = 0.002; r(s) = 0.943), respectively. The study confirmed the reliability and reproducibility of the utilised model of spinal cord trauma. The structural changes in the epicentre of injury did not impede the rapid but incomplete recovery of motor functions.","sevoflurane"

Glial scar can inhibit axonal regeneration during the recovery phase. It has demonstrated that sevoflurane has neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke, but its effects on ischemia-induced formation of astrogliosis and glial scar are unknown. This study was designed to investigate the effect of sevoflurane postconditioning on astrogliosis and glial scar formation in ischemic stroke model both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that 2.5% of sevoflurane postconditioning could significantly reduce infarction volume and improve neurologic deficits. And it could also decrease the expression of the glial scar marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurocan and phosphacan in the peri-infarct region and markedly reduce the thickness of glial scar after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Consistent with the in vivo data, in the oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/Re) model, sevoflurane postconditioning could protect astrocyte against OGD/Re-induced injury, decrease the expression of GFAP, neurocan and phosphacan. Further studies demonstrated that sevoflurane postconditioning could down-regulate the expression of Lamp1 and active cathepsin B, and block I/R or OGD/Re-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into cytoplasm. In order to confirm whether inhibition of cathepsin B could attenuate the formation of glial scar, we used cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me as a positive control. The results showed that inhibition of cathepsin B could decrease the expression of GFAP, neurocan and phosphacan. Taken together, sevoflurane postconditioning can attenuate astrogliosis and glial scar formation after ischemic stroke, associating with inhibition of the activation and release of lysosomal cathepsin B.

These inflammatory responses spread the damage to the neural cells and impair the recovery of neurological functions. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin and a simvastatin-ezetimibe combination therapy in managing the endothelial inflammatory response in an SCI rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were group-housed and SCI was induced by using the modified weight-drop method. The animals were divided into 4 groups: (1) sham group, laminectomy only (n=6); (2) no-treatment group, SCI without therapy (n=8); (3) simvastatin group (n=8), and (4) ezetimibe and simvastatin combination therapy group (n=8). A high dose (15 mg/kg) of simvastatin was given to the simvastatin group, and 10 mg/kg simvastatin and 10 mg/kg ezetimibe were given to the combination group. Neurological function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale score. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level was used as an SCI biomarker. ICAM-1 level was the highest at 72 hours after SCI in the no-treament group. The treatment groups showed significant reduction in ICAM-1 levels at 72 hours. The treatment groups, especially the combination treatment group, showed better neurological function scores. Simvastatin and simvastatin- ezetimibe all could improve the neurological function and attenuate the endothelial inflammatory response after spinal cord injury in rat.","simvastatin"

The aim of this study was to establish if systemic administration of Atorvastatin could improve functional muscle reinnervation after complete sciatic nerve section. Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. After a complete right sciatic nerve section, end-to-end microsuture repair was performed and fibrin glue was added. Three groups were studied: (1) sutures (S) + fibrin glue (F) only + saline administration for 14 days; (2) S+F+Atorvastatin administration for 14 days; and (3) uninjured nerve. Five months later, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle were isolated to perform in vivo electrophysiological measurements. Better kinematics was observed in atorvastatin-treated rats 5 months after its administration. Indeed, a larger excursion of the hip-ankle-toe angle during walking was observed. This effect was associated with the preservation of electromyographic activity (2.91 mV vs 0.77 mV) and maximal muscle force (85.1 g vs 28.6 g) on stimulation of the proximal nerve section. Five months after a neurotmetic lesion, the recovery is incomplete when using suture and fibrin glue only. Furthermore, the systemic administration of Atorvastatin for 14 days after lesion was beneficial in improving locomotion capability associated with the re-establishment of muscle strength and EMG activity.","simvastatin"

Locomotion was assessed using Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) test and walking test after SCI. In addition, microvessel density (MVD) was calculated by immunohistochemistry after SCI. We also investigate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression level by western blot after drug treatment. The results showed that BBB scores and walking test were increased in atorvastatin plus BMSC group compared to single atorvastatin and BMSC groups (P < 0.05). In addition, MVD also significantly increased in combination group compared to single treatment group. Compared to sole drug, VEGF and BDNF expression were significantly up-regulated in atorvastatin combination with BMSC group (P < 0.05).

Any agents that limit the spread of neural tissue damage may enhance the nerve regeneration. In this regard, statins have been shown to have neuroprotective properties. We investigated the effects of Lovastatin against sciatic nerve crush injury in male Wistar Rats. Lovastatin or vehicle was given parenteraly to rats for 7 days postoperative. In Lovastatin treatment groups, a single dose of agent (2 and 5 mg/kg) was administered daily. The control group was given vehicle in the same manner. The rats were subjected to crush injury in the left sciatic nerve with non-serrated clamp for 30 s. Behavioral, electrophysiological and morphological alterations were evaluated during the experimental period. Results showed that Lovastatin in a dose of 5 mg/kg could significantly (P < 0.05) accelerate regeneration process and functional recovery. Also results demonstrated that morphometric parameters such as mean axonal number and myelin thickness were significantly higher in Lovastatin (5 mg/kg) treatment groups compared to controls (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that a short-term course treatment with Lovastatin can protect against sciatic nerve injury. Findings indicate that postoperative administration of Lovastatin led to accelerate regeneration process and motor function recovery in nerve crush model in rats. This effect might be due to the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory or anti-oxidative properties of Lovastatin. It is clear that more research is needed to confirm these findings.","simvastatin"

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of BMSC treatment on traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats, and investigate if they migrate to injured areas and promote neuromotor functional recovery via upregulation of neurotrophic factors and synaptic proteins. BMSCs were cultured in vitro from female Sprague Dawley (SD) rat bone marrow and were subsequently infused into male adult SD rats via the tail vein, following induction of TBI. The results demonstrated that treatment with BMSCs significantly reduced TBI-induced neuromotor impairment and neuronal loss, as assessed by rota rod testing, western blot analysis, modified neurological severity score and immunohistochemistry. The distribution of transplanted BMSCs was tracked by monitoring the expression of sex determining region Y (SRY) in rats. The number of cells double-positive for SRY/neuronal nuclear antigen or SRY/glial fibrillary acidic protein was increased in the BMSC group, which demonstrated that BMSCs migrated to injured areas and differentiated into neurons and astrocytes, following TBI. Furthermore, administration of BMSCs increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor. Protein expression levels of synaptophysin were downregulated following TBI and this was reversed in part by treatment with BMSCs. These findings uncovered some underlying mechanisms of action of BMSCs, and may lead to their potential use as a future effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of TBI.","simvastatin"

Our previous studies confirmed activated autophagy following spinal cord injury, which was conducive to recovery of neurological functions. We hypothesized that atorvastatin could also activate autophagy after spinal cord injury, and subsequently improve recovery of neurological functions. A rat model of spinal cord injury was established based on the Allen method. Atorvastatin (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected at 1 and 2 days after spinal cord injury. At 7 days post-injury, western blot assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining results showed increased Beclin-1 and light chain 3B gene and protein expressions in the spinal cord injury atorvastatin group. Additionally, caspase-9 and caspase-3 expression was decreased, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was reduced. Compared with the spinal cord injury saline group, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores significantly increased in the spinal cord injury atorvastatin group at 14-42 days post-injury. These findings suggest that atorvastatin activated autophagy after spinal cord injury, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted recovery of neurological function.","simvastatin"

Twenty-four hours after transplantation, spinal cord injury (SCI) was produced using weight-drop method (10 g 4 cm) at the 110 level. Simvastatin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by subarachnoid injection at lumbar level 4 after SCI. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed in the 4 weeks following surgery using the open-field test and inclined-plane test. At the end of the study, MRI was used to evaluate the reparation of the injured spinal cord. Animals were then euthanized, histological evaluation was used to measure lesion cavity volumes. Immunofluorescence for GFP and cell lineage markers (NeuN and GFAP) was used to evaluate simvastatin-mediated mobilization and differentiation of transplanted BMSCs. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor recovery, less signal abnormality in MRI and a smaller cavity volume compared to the control group. Immunofluorescence revealed that simvastatin increased the number of GFP-positive cells in the injured spinal cord, and the number of cells double positive for GFP/NeuN or GFP/GFAP was larger in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed higher expression of BDNF and VEGF in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. In conclusion, simvastatin can help to repair spinal cord injury in rat, where the underlying mechanism appears to involve the mobilization of bone marrow stromal cells to the injured area and higher expression of BNDF and VEGF.

In specific, Simv administration after SCI significantly up-regulated the expression of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 phosphorylation and beta-catenin protein, increased the mRNA expression of lymphoid enhancer factor-1 and T-cell factor-1, and suppressed the expression of beta-catenin phosphorylation in the spinal cord neurons. Simv enhanced motor neuronal survival in the spinal cord anterior horn and decreased the lesion of spinal cord tissues after SCI. Simv administration after SCI also evidently reduced the expression levels of Bax, active caspase-3, and active caspase-9 in the spinal cord neurons and the proportion of transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive neuron cells, but increased the expression level of Bcl-2 in the spinal cord neurons. However, the antiapoptotic effects of Simv were reduced in cultured spinal cord nerve cells when the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed in the lipopolysaccharide-induced model.

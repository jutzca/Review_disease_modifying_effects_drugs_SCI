In these mouse models, Cre-recombination is not induced until tamoxifen is administered, which allows researchers to have temporal control of genetic modifications. Interestingly, tamoxifen has been identified as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury patients due to its neuroprotective properties. It is also reparative in that it stimulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, it is unknown whether tamoxifen is neuroprotective and neuroreparative when administration is delayed after SCI. To properly interpret data from transgenic mice in which tamoxifen treatment is delayed after SCI, it is necessary to identify the effects of tamoxifen alone on anatomical and functional recovery. In this study, female and male mice received a moderate mid-thoracic spinal cord contusion. Mice were then gavaged with corn oil or a high dose of tamoxifen from 19-22 days post-injury, and sacrificed 42 days post-injury. All mice underwent behavioral testing for the duration of the study, which revealed that tamoxifen treatment did not impact hindlimb motor recovery. Similarly, histological analyses revealed that tamoxifen had no effect on white matter sparing, total axon number, axon sprouting, glial reactivity, cell proliferation, oligodendrocyte number, or myelination, but tamoxifen did decrease the number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horn. Semi-thin sections confirmed that axon demyelination and remyelination were unaffected by tamoxifen. Sex-specific responses to tamoxifen were also assessed, and there were no significant differences between female and male mice. These data suggest that delayed tamoxifen administration after SCI does not change functional recovery or improve tissue sparing in female or male mice.","tamoxifen"

Method Subcortical axonal fiber injury model was used in this study. Morris water maze was conducted to detect the learning and memory ability of the rats; modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and beam walking test were performed to evaluate the behavioral; and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used for the determination of recovery after subcortical axonal injury, while Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of p-Akt, CDK5, p-Ser262, p-Ser404, and p-Thr205. Results Compared with the Sham group, the injury of subcortical axonal fiber resulted in higher mNSS, higher beam walking scores, longer time of escape latency, less number, time and shorter distance of crossing the quadrant, and less FA values. After ovariectomy, the mNSS, beam walking scores, and escape latency reached the peak; inversely, the others reached a minimum. High estrogen treatment reduced the mNSS, beam walking score, and escape latency; improved the number, time, and distance of crossing the quadrant; and increased the FA value. Western blotting results showed that estrogen increased the expression of p-Akt and decreased the expression of CDK5, p-Ser262, p-Ser404, and p-Thr205. All the changes were counteracted to some extent by Akt inhibitor LY294002. Conclusion After subcortical axonal injury, estrogen could improve the regeneration of axons and improve their functions via regulating the PI3K/Akt/CDK5/Tau pathway.","tamoxifen"

However, the repair and related pathophysiology of white matter after brain injury remains relatively elusive and underexplored. Successful neuroregeneration is a method for the potential treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. A nonsteroidal estrogen receptor modulator, Tamoxifen, is an effective inhibitor of cell-swelling-activated anion channels and can mimic neuroprotective effects of estrogen in experimental ischemic stroke. However, its remains unclear whether Tamoxifen has beneficial effects in the pathological process after WMLs. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of Tamoxifen on multiple elements of oligovascular niche of the male C57BL/6 mice brain after bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) - induced WMLs. Tamoxifen was injected intraperitoneally once daily from 1 day after BCAS until 1 day before sacrificed. Following chronic hypoperfusion, BCAS mice presented white matter demyelination, loss of axon-glia integrity, activated inflammatory response, and cognitive impairments. Tamoxifen treatment significantly facilitated functional restoration of working memory impairment in mice after white matter injury, thus indicating a translational potential for this estrogen receptor modulator given its clinical safety and applicability for WMLs, which lack of currently available treatments. Furthermore, Tamoxifen treatment reduced microglia activation and inflammatory response, favored microglial polarization toward to the M2 phenotype, enhanced oligodendrocyte precursor cells proliferation and differentiation, and promoted remyelination after chronic hypoperfusion. Together, our data indicate that Tamoxifen could alleviate white matter injury and play multiple targets protective effects following chronic hypoperfusion, which is a promising candidate for the therapeutic target for ischemic WMIs and other demyelination diseases associated cognitive impairment.","tamoxifen"

Driving Cre expression specifically in injured neurons has not been previously possible: we sought to address this limitation in mice using a Cre-ERT2 construct driven by a reliable indicator of axotomy, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). When crossed with reporter mice, a significant amount of recombination was achieved (without tamoxifen treatment) in peripherally-projecting sensory, sympathetic, and motoneurons after peripheral nerve crush in hemizygotes (65-80% by 16 d) and was absent in uninjured neurons. Importantly, injury-induced recombination did not occur in Schwann cells distal to the injury, and with a knock-out-validated antibody we verified an absence of ATF3 expression. Functional recovery following sciatic nerve crush in ATF3-deficient mice (both hemizygotes and homozygotes) was delayed, indicating previously unreported haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we crossed the ATF3-CreERT2 line with a floxed phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) line and show significantly improved axonal regeneration, as well as more complete recovery of neuromuscular function. We also demonstrate the utility of the ATF3-CreERT2 hemizygous line by characterizing recombination after lateral spinal hemisection (C8/T1), which identified specific populations of ascending spinal cord neurons (including putative spinothalamic and spinocerebellar) and descending supraspinal neurons (rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and hypothalamic). We anticipate these mice will be valuable in distinguishing axotomized from uninjured neurons of several different classes (e.g., via reporter expression), and in probing the function of any number of genes as they relate to neuronal injury and regeneration.","tamoxifen"

Tamoxifen exerts beneficial effects in male and female rodents but a gap of knowledge exists on: the therapeutic window of TAM, the spatio-temporal mechanisms activated and if this response is sexually dimorphic. We hypothesized that TAM will favor locomotor recovery when administered up-to 24 h after SCI in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received a thoracic (T10) contusion using the MACSIS impactor followed by placebo or TAM (15 mg/21 days) pellets in a therapeutic window of 0, 6, 12, or 24 h. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, 28 or 35 days post injury (DPI) to study the molecular and cellular changes in the acute and chronic stages. Immediate or delayed therapy (t = 6 h) improved locomotor function, increased white matter spared tissue, and neuronal survival. TAM reduced reactive gliosis during chronic stages and increased the expression of Olig-2. A significant difference was observed in estrogen receptor alpha between male and female rodents from 2 to 28 DPI suggesting a sexually dimorphic characteristic that could be related to the behavioral differences observed in the therapeutic window of TAM. This study supports the use of TAM in the SCI setting due to its neuroprotective effects but with a significant sexually dimorphic therapeutic window.","tamoxifen"

Mice were immunized with an immunogenic peptide corresponding to amino acids 35-55 of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected with pertussis toxin to induce EAE. Unlike clozapine, quetiapine and tamoxifen, administration of pioglitazone beginning at peak disease decreased both clinical scores and lumbar white matter loss in EAE mice. Using kinematic gait analysis, we found that pioglitazone also maintained normal movement of the hip, knee and ankle joints for at least 44 days after MOG(35)(-)(55) immunization. This long-lasting preservation of hindleg joint movements was accompanied by reduced white matter loss, microglial and macrophage activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the lumbar spinal cords of EAE mice. These results support clinical findings that suggest pioglitazone may reduce the progressive loss of motor function in MS by decreasing inflammation and myelin damage.","tamoxifen"

In this study, the penetrating injury was provoked by a sharp projectile that penetrates through right dorsal and ventral portions of the T13-L1 spinal segments, affecting propriospinal and descending/ascending tracts. Intraperitoneal application of Tamoxifen and a treadmill exercise protocol, as rehabilitation therapies, separately or combined, were used. To evaluate the functional recovery, angular patterns of the hip, knee and ankle joints as well as the leg pendulum-like movement (PLM) were measured during the unrestricted gait of treated and untreated (UT) animals, previously and after the traumatic injury (15 and 30 days post-injury (dpi)). A pattern (curve) comparison analysis was made by using a locally designed Matlab script that determines the Frechet dissimilarity. The SCI magnitude was assessed by qualitative and quantitative histological analysis of the injury site 30 days after SCI. Our results showed that all treated groups had an improvement in hindlimbs kinematics compared to the UT group, which showed a poor gait locomotion recovery throughout the rehabilitation period. The group with the combined treatment (tamoxifen+exercise (TE)) presented the best outcome.

Many molecular and cellular events are triggered after the initial physical impact to the cord. Two major phases have been described in the field of SCI: an acute phase and late phase. Most of the therapeutic strategies are focused on the late phase because this provides an opportunity to target cellular events like apoptosis, demyelination, scar formation and axonal outgrowth. In this mini-review, we will focus on two agents (tamoxifen and a Src kinase family inhibitor known as PP2) that have been shown in our laboratory to produce neuroprotective (increase cell survival) and/or regenerative (axonal outgrowth) actions. The animal model used in our laboratory is adult female rat (similar to 250 g) with a moderate contusion (12.5 mm) to the spinal cord at the Tic, level, using the MASCIS impactor device. Tamoxifen or PP2 was administered by implantation of a 15 mg pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) or by intraperitoneal injections (1.5 mg/kg, every 3 days), respectively, to produce a long-term effect (28 days). Tamoxifen and the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, are drugs that in rats with a moderate spinal cord injury promote functional locomotor recovery, increase spared white matter tissue, and stimulate axonal outgrowth. Moreover, tamoxifen reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, these drugs are possible therapeutic agents that have a neuroprotective/regenerative activity in vertebrates with SCI.","tamoxifen"

After the PI, tamoxifen a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has been described as a neuroprotector and antiinflammatory drug, or vehicle was administered. Electrical stimulation in the hippocampus produces muscle contractions in the contralateral triceps, when 6 Hz or 8 Hz pulse trains were applied. The penetrating injury in the hippocampus reduced the EMG amplitude after the electrical stimulation. At 7DPI (days post-injury) we observed an increase in the strides speed in all four limbs of the non-treated group, decreasing the correlation percentage of the studied joints. After 15DPI the strides speed in the non-treated returned to normal. These changes did not occur in the tamoxifen group nor in cortex-injured group. After 30 days, the nontreated group presented a reduction in the number of pyramidal cell layer neurons at the injury site, in comparison to the tam-treated group.

We herein demonstrate increased neural input onto spinal neurons caudal to the lesion in spinal cord injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice as indicated by increased levels of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) compared to controls. Axonal sparing, long-range axonal regeneration and reactive sprouting were investigated as possible explanations for the increase in neural inputs caudal to the lesion and for the improved locomotor outcomes in spinal cord-injured Sox9 conditional knock out mice. Whereas retrograde tract-tracing studies failed to reveal any evidence for increased axonal sparing or for long-range regeneration in the Sox9 conditional knock out mice, anterograde tract-tracing experiments demonstrated increased reactive sprouting caudal to the lesion after SCI. Finally we demonstrate that application of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor to reduce CSPG degradation in Sox9 conditional knock out mice prevents the improvements in locomotor recovery observed in untreated Sox9 conditional knock out mice.

It has been shown in several studies that IKK/NF-kB signaling pathway plays a key role in pathophysiology of SCI. In this study, three groups of rats (n = 17 each) were selected that included, tamoxifen group (here tamoxifen was injected after SCI in rats), SCI group (here only dimethylsulfoxide was administered after inducing SCI in rats) and sham group (here only laminectomy was performed). The effect of tamoxifen (5 mg/kg) on various factors responsible for activation of IKK/NF-kB signaling pathway including NF-kB p65, phosphorylated I-kB alpha was studied through Western blotting as well as densitometry. The examination of expression of active caspase-3 and myeloperoxidase activity was also carried out through Western blot analysis and densitometry. A comparison of three groups of rats showed that administration of tamoxifen significantly reduced the expression of NF-kB p65 and phosphorylated I-kB alpha (P < 0.05) compared to control. It also attenuated the expression of active caspase-3 resulting in the reduction of apoptosis, and infiltration of leukocytes to the injury site was also greatly reduced in the group where tamoxifen was administered. Statistical analysis through SPSS 13.0 software showed a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory factors in groups where tamoxifen was administered. We conclude that tamoxifen possesses the potential neuroprotective effects that can be explored further for future therapeutic techniques in treating spinal cord injuries.","tamoxifen"

However, its role as a neuroprotective agent after spinal cord injury (SCI), or the involvement of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-a) in locomotor recovery, is still a subject of much debate. In this study, we evaluated the effects of estradiol and of Tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor mixed agonist/antagonist) on locomotor recovery following SCI. To control estradiol cyclical variability, ovariectomized female rats received empty or estradiol filled implants, prior to a moderate contusion to the spinal cord. Estradiol improved locomotor function at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (DPI), when compared to control groups (measured with the BBB open field test). This effect was ER-a mediated, because functional recovery was blocked with an ER-a antagonist. We also observed that ER-a was up-regulated after SCI. Long-term treatment (28 DPI) with estradiol and Tamoxifen reduced the extent of the lesion cavity, an effect also mediated by ER-a. The antioxidant effects of estradiol were seen acutely at 2 DPI but not at 28 DPI, and this acute effect was not receptor mediated. Rats treated with Tamoxifen recovered some locomotor activity at 21 and 28 DPI, which could be related to the antioxidant protection seen at these time points. These results show that estradiol improves functional outcome, and these protective effects are mediated by the ER-a dependent and independent-mechanisms. Tamoxifen's effects during late stages of SCI support the use of this drug as a long-term alternative treatment for this condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","tamoxifen"

However, it remains unknown whether this agent shows a similar beneficial effect after spinal cord injury (SCI), and what are its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability, tissue edema formation, microglial activation, neuronal cell death and myelin loss were determined in rats subjected to spinal cord contusion. The results showed that tamoxifen, administered at 30 min post-injury, significantly decreased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) production induced by microglial activation, alleviated the amount of Evans blue leakage and edema formation. In addition, tamoxifen treatment clearly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons post-SCI. The myelin loss and the increase in production of myelin-associated axonal growth inhibitors were also found to be significantly attenuated at day 3 post-injury. Furthermore, rats treated with tamoxifen scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI than did vehicle-treated rats, suggesting improved functional outcome after SCI. Together, these results demonstrate that tamoxifen provides neuroprotective effects for treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability, and is therefore a potential neuroprotectant for human spinal cord injury therapy.","tamoxifen"

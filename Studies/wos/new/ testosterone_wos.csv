Patients with SCI usually exhibit severe clinical symptoms, including sensory and motor dysfunction below the injured levels, paraplegia, quadriplegia and urinary retention, which can exacerbate the substantial medical and social burdens. The major pathological change observed in SCI is inflammatory reaction, which induces demyelination, axonal degeneration, and the apoptosis and necrosis of neurons. Traditional medical treatments are mainly focused on the recovery of motor function and prevention of complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of SCI and have proposed lots of effective treatments, but the clinical applications are still limited due to the complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis after SCI. Endocrine hormones are kinds of molecules that are synthesized by specialized endocrine organs and can participate in the regulation of multiple physiological activities, and their protective effects on several disorders have been widely discussed. In addition, many studies have identified that endocrine hormones can promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery in individuals with central nervous system diseases. Therefore, studies investigating the clinical applications of endocrine hormones as treatments for SCI are necessary. In this review, we described the neuroprotective roles of several endocrine hormones in SCI; endocrine hormone administration reduces cell death and promotes functional repair after SCI. We also proposed novel therapies for SCI.","testosterone"

Cortisol concentration (baseline, pre-, and post-game) and heart rate were analyzed in five official games. Heart rate data were stratified according to the Edwards method. Significant differences were observed in pre- and post-cortisol concentrations only for the amputated group. No significant correlations were found between cortisol variation and intensity ranges. Athletes with neurological damage were not responsive to wheelchair basketball in relation to salivary cortisol concentrations. The game intensity cannot be verified by the biomarker cortisol for all types of disabilities.

Our objectives were to determine (a) the acute effects of bodyweight-supported treadmill training (TM) on hindlimb cancellous bone microstructure and muscle mass in adult rats after severe contusion SCI and (b) whether longer-term TM with adjuvant testosterone enanthate (TE) delivers musculoskeletal benefit. In Study 1, TM (40 min/day, 5 days/week, beginning 1 week postsurgery) did not prevent SCI-induced hindlimb cancellous bone loss after 3 weeks. In Study 2, TM did not attenuate SCI-induced plantar flexor muscles atrophy nor improve locomotor recovery after 4 weeks. In our main study, SCI produced extensive distal femur and proximal tibia cancellous bone deficits, a deleterious slow-to-fast fiber-type transition in soleus, lower muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), impaired muscle force production, and levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle atrophy after 8 weeks. TE alone (7.0 mg/week) suppressed bone resorption, attenuated cancellous bone loss, constrained the soleus fiber-type transition, and prevented LABC atrophy. In comparison, TE+TM concomitantly suppressed bone resorption and stimulated bone formation after SCI, produced near-complete cancellous bone preservation, prevented the soleus fiber-type transition, attenuated soleus fCSA atrophy, maintained soleus force production, and increased LABC mass. 75% of SCI+TE+TM animals recovered voluntary over-ground hindlimb stepping, while no SCI and only 20% of SCI+TE animals regained stepping ability. Positive associations between testosterone and locomotor function suggest that TE influenced locomotor recovery. In conclusion, short-term TM alone did not improve bone, muscle, or locomotor recovery in adult rats after severe SCI, while longer-term TE+TM provided more comprehensive musculoskeletal benefit than TE alone.","testosterone"

Inclusion of both sexes when modeling neurotrauma is leading to the identification of novel areas for therapeutic and scientific exploitation. Here, we review the organizational and activational effects of sex hormones on recovery from injury and how these changes impact the long-term health of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. When determining how sex affects SCI it remains imperative to expand outcomes beyond locomotor recovery and consider other complications plaguing the quality of life of patients with SCI. Interestingly, the SCI field predominately utilizes female rodents for basic science research which contrasts most other male-biased research fields. We discuss the unique caveats this creates to the translatability of preclinical research in the SCI field. We also review current clinical and preclinical data examining sex as biological variable in SCI. Further, we report how technical considerations such as housing, size, care management, and age, confound the interpretation of sex-specific effects in animal studies of SCI. We have uncovered novel findings regarding how age differentially affects mortality and injury-induced anemia in males and females after SCI, and further identified estrus cycle dysfunction in mice after injury. Emerging concepts underlying sexually dimorphic responses to therapy are also discussed. Through a combination of literature review and primary research observations we present a practical guide for considering and incorporating sex as biological variable in preclinical neurotrauma studies.","testosterone"

In experimental animal models, however, many studies used females. Funding agencies like the National Institutes of Health recommend that new proposed studies should include both genders due to variations in gender response to injuries, diseases, and treatments. However, cost and considerations for some animal models, such as SCI, affect investigators in adapting to this recommendation. Research has increased comparing gender effects in various disease and injury models, including SCI. However, most studies use weight-matched animals, which poses issues in comparing results and outcomes. The present study compared histologic and functional outcomes between age-matched male and female Sprague-Dawley rats in a moderate thoracic contusion SCI model. Cresyl violet and eosin staining showed no significant differences in lesion volume between genders after 9 weeks post-SCI (p > 0.05). Luxol fast blue-stained spared myelin was similar between genders, although slightly greater (similar to 6%) in spared myelin, compared with cord volume (p = 0.044). Glial reactivity and macrophage labeling in the lesion area was comparable between genders, as well. Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) functional scores were not significantly different between genders, and Hargreaves thermal hyperalgesia and Gridwalk sensorimotor analyses also were similar between genders, compared with uninjured gender controls. Analysis of covariance showed weight did not influence functional recovery as assessed through BBB (p = 0.65) or Gridwalk assessment (p = 0.63) in this study.

NLRP1 and NLRP3 are known as activators of inflammasome complex in the spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, cell therapy using Schwann cells (SCs) was applied for targeting NLRP inflammasome complexes outcomes in the motor recovery. These cells were chosen due to their regenerative roles for CNS injuries. SCs were isolated from sciatic nerves and transplanted to the contusive SCI-induced Wistar rats. NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasome complexes and their related pro-inflammatory cytokines were assayed in both mRNA and protein levels. Neuronal cell survival (Nissl staining), motor recovery and myelination (Luxol fast blue/LFB) were also evaluated. The groups were laminectomy, SCI, vehicle and treatment. The treatment group received Schwann cells, and the vehicle group received solvent for the cells. SCI caused increased expressions for both NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasome complexes along with their related pro-inflammatory cytokines, all of which were abrogated after administration of SCs (except for IL-18 protein showing no change to the cell therapy). Motor deficits in the hind limb, neuronal cell death and demyelination were also found in the SCI group, which were counteracted in the treatment group. From our findings we conclude promising role for cell therapy with SCs for targeting axonal demyelination and degeneration possibly through attenuation of the activity for inflammasome complexes and related inflammatory circuit.","testosterone"

We examined the effect of cardiac arrest in mice on testis weight and various aspects of BTB function. Testis weight was decreased by about 24% 12 hours after cardiac arrest but had recovered fully by day 7. The testis/serum ratio for albumin was increased 12 hours after arrest, showing a disruption in the vascular BTB with recovery by 24 hours. The testis/serum ratio for sucrose was not consistently elevated, showing that the Sertoli cell BTB remained intact. The testis/serum ratio for verapamil was increased on day 3 of cardiac arrest, suggesting impaired function of the BTB's p-glycoprotein efflux transporter. Transporters for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were not affected by cardiac arrest. These results show that cardiac arrest affects testis weight and some aspects of BTB function. Such changes might have long-term effects on testicular function.","testosterone"

Here we studied the effects of clenbuterol and testosterone propionate administered separately or in combination on skeletal muscle properties and adipose tissue in adult CD1 mice spinal-cord-transected (Tx) at the low-thoracic level (i.e., induced complete paraplegia). Administered shortly post-Tx, these substances were found to differentially reduce loss in body weight, muscle mass, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) values. Although all three treatments induced significant effects, testosterone-treated animals were generally less protected against Tx-related changes. However, none of the treatments prevented fat tissue loss or muscle fiber type conversion and functional loss generally found in Tx animals. These results provide evidence suggesting that clenbuterol alone or combined with testosterone may constitute better clinically-relevant treatments than testosterone alone to decrease muscle atrophy (mass and fiber CSA) in SCI subjects.","testosterone"

Treatment options are limited, and recovery is often incomplete. Treadmill exercise can enhance nerve regeneration; however, this appears to occur in a sex-dependent manner. Females respond best to short duration, high speed interval training; whereas, males respond best to slower, continuous training. Previous studies have shown a role for testosterone in this process, but the role of estrogen is unknown. To evaluate the role of estrogen signaling in treadmill exercise, we blocked estrogen receptor (ER) signaling during treadmill exercise in males and female wild type mice. The right common fibular (CF) branch of the sciatic nerve was cut and repaired with fibrin glue that contained the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Estradiol-filled or blank Silastic capsules were implanted subcutaneously at the time of nerve transection. Starting three days post-transection, exercised mice received treadmill training using the paradigm appropriate to their sex 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Fourteen days after the initial nerve transection, motoneurons whose axons had regenerated at least 1.5 mm distal to the original cut sites were labeled with a retrograde tracer. Regeneration was quantified by counting the number of fluorescent labeled motoneurons in the lumbar region of the spinal cord. Both treadmill training and estradiol administration increased the number of motoneurons participating in axon regeneration, but these effects were blocked by ER antagonist treatment. Estrogen signaling is important for the enhancing effects of treadmill exercise on motoneuron participation after peripheral nerve cut. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The majority of treatment strategies after SCI have concentrated on the damaged spinal cord, for example working to reduce lesion size or spread, or encouraging regrowth of severed descending axonal projections through the lesion, hoping to re-establish synaptic connectivity with caudal targets. In our work, we have focused on a novel target for treatment after SCI, surviving spinal motoneurons and their target musculature, with the hope of developing effective treatments to preserve or restore lost function following SCI. We previously demonstrated that motoneurons, and the muscles they innervate, show pronounced atrophy after SCI. Importantly, SCI-induced atrophy of motoneuron dendrites can be attenuated by treatment with gonadal hormones, testosterone and its active metabolites, estradiol and dihydrotestosterone. Similarly, SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas can be prevented by treatment with androgens. Together, these findings suggest that regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology seen after SCI can be ameliorated by treatment with gonadal hormones, further supporting a role for steroid hormones as neurotherapeutic agents in the injured nervous system.","testosterone"

However, ABT efficacy declines as SCI severity increases. Additionally, many men with SCI exhibit low testosterone, which may exacerbate neuromusculoskeletal impairment. Incorporating testosterone adjuvant to ABTs may improve musculoskeletal recovery and neuroplasticity because androgens attenuate muscle loss and the slow-to-fast muscle fiber-type transition after SCI, in a manner independent from mechanical strain, and promote motoneuron survival. These neuromusculoskeletal benefits are promising, although testosterone alone produces only limited functional improvement in rodent SCI models.

The coexpression of steroid hormone and neurotrophin receptor mRNAs and proteins, as well as their reciprocal regulation provides the necessary substrates for such interactions to occur. This review will focus on androgen brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) interactions in the spinal cord, describing androgen regulation of BDNF in neuromuscular systems following castration, androgen manipulation, and injury. Androgens interact with BDNF during development to regulate normally-occurring motoneuron death, and in adulthood, androgen BDNF interactions are involved in the maintenance of several features of neuromuscular systems. Androgens regulate BDNF and trkB expression in spinal motoneurons. Androgens also regulate BDNF levels in the target musculature, and androgenic action at the muscle regulates BDNF levels in motoneurons. These interactions have important implications for the maintenance of motoneuron morphology. Finally, androgens interact with BDNF after injury, influencing soma size, dendritic morphology, and axon regeneration. Together, these findings provide further insight into the development and maintenance of neuromuscular systems and have implications for the neurotherapeutic/neuroprotective roles of androgens and trophic factors in the treatment of motoneuron disease and recovery from injury.","testosterone"

Forty enzymes regulated these 15 metabolites in the metabolic network. We also found that 16 metabolites regulated by 130 enzymes in the metabolic network impacted neurobehavioral recovery. Using the Eigen-metabolome, we established a linear discrimination model to cluster rats with severe and mild SCI and control rats into separate groups and identify the interactive relationships between metabolic biomarkers in the global metabolic network. We identified 10 clusters in the global metabolic network and defined them as distinct metabolic disturbance domains of SCI. Metabolic paths such as retinal, glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid metabolism; NAD-NADPH conversion process, tyrosine metabolism, and cadaverine and putrescine metabolism were included. In summary, we presented a novel interdisciplinary method that integrates metabolomics and global metabolic network analysis to visualize metabolic network disturbances after SCI. Our study demonstrated the systems biological study paradigm that integration of 1H-NMR, metabolomics, and global metabolic network analysis is useful to visualize complex metabolic disturbances after severe SCI. Furthermore, our findings may provide a new quantitative injury severity evaluation model for clinical use.","testosterone"

Males with SCI tend to be injured at an earlier age, mostly during sports or motor vehicle accidents, whereas females tend be injured later in life, particularly in the age group 65 and older. In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females. Similar controversy exists clinically, in studies that have examined gender disparities in outcome after SCI. The current review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for a gender bias in outcome following SCI and discusses issues that have made it difficult to conclusively answer this question.","testosterone"

In this study, we examined the long-term (>4 weeks) effects of SCI on spermatogenesis and its recovery. Results of this study reveal that while serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone levels in SCI rats recovered within 1 month after the injury, their spermatogenesis continued to regress. By 3 months, spermatogenesis in 70% of SCI rats has totally regressed, characterized by the absence of proliferating spermatogonia; these effects could not be prevented by an otherwise effective regimen of testosterone treatment. Sertoli cells in the regressed seminiferous tubules exhibited unusual behavior, characterized by the formation of multiple cell layers and/or aggregates that extended into the tubular lumen. Active spermatogenesis was observed in nine of the 19 SCI rats by 6 months, seven of which had complete spermatogenesis, but with persisting abnormalities. These results demonstrate that SCI results in total, but reversible, regression of spermatogenesis. Failure to prevent such effects by an otherwise effective exogenous testosterone regimen suggests that nonendocrine factors are involved in the SCI effects on spermatogenesis. The unusual Sertoli cell localization in the regressed testes may have been triggered by the loss of proliferating spermatogonia and may be involved in subsequent spermatogenic recovery.","testosterone"

Previously we noted that, in the rat, the weight of the prostate decreased following surgically induced spinal cord injury (SCI). This observation suggests that growth, and possibly function, of the prostate may be compromised after SCI. To explore this possibility, we examined the effects of SCI on the androgen-related biochemical properties and morphology of the prostate in the rat at various times after surgically induced SCI. SCI resulted in an acute decrease in prostate weight and an increase in steady state level of mRNA for testosterone-repressed prostate message 2 (TRPM 2) during the first 2 weeks postinjury, These changes perhaps relate to an increase in cell death or a decrease in secretory activity due to an acute suppression of serum testosterone after the injury. Concomitantly, there was a transient, but significant, decrease in the steady state level of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA in the prostate during the first 2 weeks after SCI, an indication of an altered autoregulation of AR by its own ligand. Despite the fact that growth of the prostate, as indicated by weight increase, in SCI rats resumed 2 weeks postinjury, prostate weights were persistently lower in SCI rats than sham-operated controls for at least 3 months. Furthermore, prostate TRPM 2 mRNA levels remained elevated throughout the recovery period even after a normal prostate weight had been restored. In addition, a decrease in the height of ventral prostate epithelial cells was noted in SCI rats 28 and 90 days postinjury. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of SCI on prostate function. These findings and our unreported observation of persistently smaller seminal vesicles in the same groups of SCI rats suggest that functions of male accessory sex glands may also be compromised after SCI. These changes may affect biochemical properties of the secretory products of these glands and may provide same explanation for the reported changes in the composition of the seminal plasma and abnormal sperm motility seen in the semen of SCI men.","testosterone"

Current empirical animal research lacks sizable test groups to definitively determine whether significant differences exist. Evaluating locomotor recovery variances between sexes following a precise, clinically relevant spinal cord contusion model can provide valuable insight into a possible gender-related advantage in outcome post-SCI. In the current study, we hypothesized that by employing larger sample sizes in a reproducible contusive SCI paradigm, subtle distinctions in locomotor recovery between sexes, if they exist, would be elucidated through a broad range of behavioral tests. During 13 weeks of functional assessment after a thoracic (T8) contusive SCI in rat, significant differences owing to gender existed for the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score and CatWalk hindlimb swing, support four, and single stance analyses. Significant differences in locomotor performance were noticeable as early as 4 weeks post-SCI. Stereological tissue-volume analysis determined that females, more so than males, also exhibited greater volumes of preserved gray and white matter within the injured cord segment as well as more spared ventral white matter area at the center of the lesion. The stereological tissue analysis differences favoring females directly correlated with the female rats' greater functional improvement observed at endpoint.","testosterone"

Peripheral nerve injury is also known to increase the expression of a 43 kilodalton growth-associated protein (GAP-43). In the intact brain, GAP-43 expression is affected by gonadal steroids. We thus postulated that steroidal modulation of GAP-43 gene expression may be a component of the neurotrophic action of TP in regenerating neurons. This issue was examined in hamster facial motor neurons (FMN) which contain androgen receptors and which have been shown to respond to exogenous steroids in a number of previous studies. Castrated adult male hamsters were subjected to right facial nerve transection and treated with either TP via subcutaneous hormone capsule implants, or left untreated (no hormone replacement). At post-injury/treatment times of 0.25, 2, 4, 7, and 14 d, the brain stem regions were harvested, cryostat sections were collected through the facial motor nucleus, and in situ hybridization was done using a (33)P-labeled GAP-43 cDNA probe. Quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms by computer assisted grain counting revealed that axotomy produced a dramatic increase in GAP-43 mRNA levels in FMN by 2 d post-axotomy and that this increase remained through 14 d post-injury in both the TP-treated and the untreated group. In the nonhormone-treated group, there was a statistically significant dip in GAP-43 mRNA levels in FMN at 7 d post-operative, relative to 4 d post-operative levels. TP-treatment prevented this transient decline in GAP-43 mRNA levels in axotomized FMN.","testosterone"

Testosterone can be aromatized to 17 beta-estradiol and may increase estrogen-mediated protection. Alternatively, testosterone has been shown to increase excitotoxicity in models of central nervous system (CNS) injury. These experiments test the hypothesis that endogenous testosterone in male rats alters 17 beta-estradiol-mediated protection by evaluating a delayed administration over a clinically relevant dose range and manipulating testicular-derived testosterone. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were either gonadectomized or left gonad-intact prior to SCI. SCI was produced by a midthoracic crush injury. At 30 min post SCI, animals received a subcutaneous pellet of 0.0, 0.05, 0.5, or 5.0mg of 17 beta-estradiol, released over 21 days. Hindlimb locomotion was analyzed weekly in the open field. Spinal cords were collected and analyzed for cell death, expression of Bcl-family proteins, and white-matter sparing. Post-SCI administration of the 0.5- or 5.0-mg pellet improved hindlimb locomotion, reduced urinary bladder size, increased neuronal survival, reduced apoptosis, improved the Bax/Bcl-xL protein ratio, and increased white-matter sparing. In the absence of endogenous testicular-derived androgens, SCI induced greater apoptosis, yet 17 beta-estradiol administration reduced apoptosis to the same extent in gonadectomized and gonad-intact male rats. These data suggest that delayed post-SCI administration of a clinically relevant dose of 17 beta-estradiol is protective in male rats, and endogenous androgens do not alter estrogen-mediated protection. These data suggest that 17 beta-estradiol is an effective therapeutic intervention for reducing secondary damage after SCI in males, which could be readily translated to clinical trials.","testosterone"

We depleted SNB motoneurons on one side only of the spinal cord by unilateral intramuscular injection of a retrogradely transported form of saporin, and examined the morphology of contralateral SNB motoneurons. Motoneuron morphology was assessed in normal control males, gonadally intact saporin-treated males, and saporin-treated males who had been castrated 6 weeks previously and given testosterone replacement beginning at the time of saporin injection. Untreated castrated males served as an additional control group. Four weeks after saporin treatment, SNB motoneurons contralateral to the saporin injection were retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the cholera toxin B subunit and reconstructed in three dimensions. In gonadally intact males, unilateral motoneuron depletion caused regressive changes in contralateral SNB motoneurons: Soma size and dendritic length were both decreased. However, testosterone manipulation (i.e., castration followed by testosterone replacement) completely prevented the dendritic retraction. These data suggest a therapeutic role for testosterone in preventing, or accelerating recovery from, dendritic atrophy induced by motoneuron injury.","testosterone"

Central synaptic stripping following peripheral motor neuron damage is a well-established component of the injury response. Gonadal steroids regulate synaptogenesis in the normal nervous system. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that testosterone propionate administration at the time of facial nerve transection alters the synaptic connectivity of injured facial motoneurons. Adult hamsters were subjected to right facial nerve transection at the level of the stylomastoid foramen. Half the animals received subcutaneous implants of testosterone propionate; the other half were sham implanted. At 5 days postoperative, the animals were killed by intracardiac perfusion-fixation, and the control and axotomized facial nuclear groups from the brainstems of nonhormone- and testosterone propionate-treated animals processed for routine transmission electron microscopy. Quantiative analysis of the synaptic ratio (percent somal membrane covered by synaptic profiles) and the average length of axosomatic synapses was accomplished. The results indicate that axotomy alone resulted in an 81% reduction in the synaptic ratio and a 26% decrease in the average synaptic length of axosomatic synapses. Exposure to testosterone propionate from the time of facial nerve transection resulted in only a 48% reduction in the synaptic ratio and a 16% decrease in the average synaptic length of axosomatic synapses following injury. Thus, testosterone propionate significantly attenuated the amount of synaptic stripping that occurred at 5 days postoperative and the decrease in average length of the remaining synapses as well. It is concluded that gonadal, steroids modulate central synaptic plasticity following peripheral nerve injury. The results are discussed in light of our recent findings of steroidal effects on the central astrocyctic response to facial nerve injury as well.","testosterone"

Since many of the aspects of normal neuronal functioning altered by gonadal steroids are affected by injury to the nervous system, we initiated a series of experiments designed to exploit the trophic capabilities of steroids as therapeutic agents in neuronal injury and repair (Kujawa ct al., 1989, 1991; Kujawa and Jones, 1990). Three steroid-sensitive model systems were used for these studies: the hamster facial motoneuron, the rat sciatic motoneuron, and the hamster rubrospinal motoneuron. The results of our initial series of experiments suggest that androgens, and possibly estrogens, act either directly or indirectly on the injured motoneuron and enhance elements of the neuronal reparative response that are critical to successful recovery of function. Recently, we discovered that gonadal steroids may also modulate the central glia response to nerve damage. In this review, a summary of our data identifying a therapeutic role for androgens in enhancing the reparative response of motoneurons to injury is presented.

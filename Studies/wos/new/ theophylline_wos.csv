Systemically administered theophylline activates a functionally latent crossed phrenic pathway (CPP) which decussates caudal to the hemisection and activates phrenic motoneurons ipsilateral to the hemisection. The result is return of function to the paralyzed hemidiaphragm. Unfortunately, in humans, systemically administered theophylline at a therapeutic dose produces many unwanted side effects.","theophylline"

The present study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of adenosine A1 receptor blockade (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, DPCPX) on SDB in a rodent model of SCI. We hypothesized that SCI induced via left hemisection of the second cervical segment (C2Hx) results in SDB. We further hypothesized that blockade of adenosine A1 receptors following C2Hx would reduce the severity of SDB. In the first experiment, adult male rats underwent left C2Hx or sham (laminectomy) surgery. Unrestrained whole body plethysmography (WBP) and implanted wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) were used for assessment of breathing during spontaneous sleep and for the scoring of respiratory events at the acute (similar to 1 wk), and chronic (similar to 6 wk) time points following C2Hx. During the second experiment, the effect of oral administration of adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 3 times a day for 4 days) on SCI induced SDB was assessed. C2Hx animals exhibited a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) compared with the sham group, respectively (35.5 +/- 12.6 vs. 19.1 +/- 2.1 events/h, P < 0.001). AHI was elevated 6 wk following C2Hx (week 6, 32.0 +/- 5.0 vs. week 1, 42.6 +/- 11.8 events/h, respectively, P = 0.12). In contrast to placebo, oral administration of DPCPX significantly decreased AHI 4 days after the treatment (159.8 +/- 26.7 vs. 69.5 +/- 8.9%, P < 0.05). Cervical SCI is associated with the development of SDB in spontaneously breathing rats. Adenosine A1 blockade can serve as a therapeutic target for SDB induced by SCI.","theophylline"

Our working model proposes that A2a receptor-mediated TrkB receptor activation strengthens glutamatergic synapses onto phrenic motoneurons. Activation of glutamate N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been implicated in other models of phrenic motor plasticity. Thus we hypothesized that NMDA receptor activation also would contribute to A2a receptor-mediated phrenic motor facilitation. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane, mechanically ventilated, neuromuscularly paralyzed, and bilaterally vagotomized. The A2a receptor agonist CGS-21680 and the NMDA receptor-channel blocker MK-801 were administered intrathecally over the C4 spinal segment. Phrenic nerve activity was recorded before, during, and after drug administration. MK-801 (concentration range 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100 mu M) was administered 30 min before CGS-21680 (50 mu M). MK-801 dose-dependently blocked A2a receptor-mediated phrenic motor facilitation. When administered at 60 min post-CGS-21680, MK-801 prevented further increases in phrenic nerve activity compared with the CGS-21680 alone (CGS-21680 alone at 120 min: 114 +/- 19%; CGS-21680 and MK-801 at 60 min post-CGS-21680: 61 +/- 11%, above baseline, P < 0.05) but did not return phrenic motor output to baseline values. Our data suggest that NMDA receptor activation is necessary for de novo A2a receptor-mediated phrenic motor facilitation and that the maintenance of preexisting phrenic motor facilitation does not involve NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms.","theophylline"

These injuries can result in the impaired ability to breathe. In this study we examine the role of theophylline in the rescue of breathing behavior after a cervical spinal contusion. Previous research in the C2 hemisection model has shown that acute administration of theophylline can rescue phrenic nerve activity and diaphragmatic EMG on the side ipsilateral to injury. However, this effect is dependent on intact and uninjured pathways. In this study we utilized a cervical contusion injury model that more closely mimics the human condition. This injury model can determine the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, in this case theophylline, on the isolated contused pathways of the spinal cord. Three weeks after a 150 kD C3/4 unilateral contusion subjects received a 15 mg/kg dose of theophylline prior to a contralateral C2 hemisection. Subjects that received theophylline were able to effectively utilize damaged pathways to breathe for up to 2 min, while subjects treated with saline were unable to support ventilation. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that theophylline can make injured pathways that mediate breathing more effective and therefore, suggest a potential therapeutic role in the critical time points immediately after injury.

Experiments were conducted on anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rats in which phrenic nerve activity was recorded bilaterally. Before drug injection, the phrenic nerve contralateral to hemisection showed vigorous respiratory-related activity, but the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection showed no discernible respiratory-related activity. ACPD (1-100 nl, I mM) was injected directly into the region of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a known medullary chemoreceptor area. Microinjection of ACPD into the right RTN increased respiratory-related activity in the right phrenic nerve (contralateral to hemisection). ACPD (>5 nl, I mM) microinjection also significantly induced respiratory recovery in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection in a dose-dependent manner.

Messenger RNA levels for pro-inflammatory genes (TXNIP, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and iNOS) and neurotrophic and survival factors (BDNF, GDNF, and Bcl2) were analyzed by real time quantitative PCR. Gene expression pattern was unaltered in SH rats. TXNIP, iNOS, BDNF, GDNF and Bcl2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the ipsilateral hemi spinal cord in C2H rats. BDNF, GDNF and Bcl2 levels remained elevated in the ipsilateral hemi spinal cord in C2H-T day 5 rats. In this same group, there was further enhancement in TXNIP and IL-1 beta while iNOS returned to basal levels. Theophylline increased DNA binding activity of transcription factors cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) and pro-inflammatory NF-kappa B. Messenger RNA levels for all genes returned to basal levels in C2H-T day 17 rats. However, BDNF mRNA levels remained significantly elevated after weaning from the drug.

But another aspect of mitochondrial function is the generation of more than 90% of cellular energy in the form of ATP, mediated by the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) process. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a central OxPhos component and changes in its activity reflect changes in energy demand. A recent study suggests that respiratory muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is compromised via alterations in mitochondrial function. In an animal model of cervical spinal cord hemisection (C2HS) respiratory dysfunction, we have shown that theophylline improves respiratory function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that theophylline improves respiratory function at the cellular level via improved mitochondrial function in the C2HS model. We demonstrate that CcO activity was significantly (33%) increased in the spinal cord adjacent to the site of injury (C3-C5), and that administration of theophylline (20 mg/kg 3x daily orally) after C2HS leads to an even more pronounced increase in CcO activity of 62% compared to sham-operated animals. These results are paralleled by a significant increase in cellular ATP levels (51% in the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the hemisection). We conclude that C2HS increases energy demand and activates mitochondrial respiration, and that theophylline treatment improves energy levels through activation of the mitochondrial OxPhos process to provide energy for tissue repair and functional recovery after paralysis in the C2HS model.

Of interest, upper parasternal intercostal EMG activity was also recruited on the left in spite of being below the level of cervical injury. We speculate that the administration of theophylline in selected patients with an asymmetric cervical spinal cord injury may activate latent bulbospinal respiratory pathways and improve inspiratory muscle function, reducing the likelihood of associated respiratory failure.","theophylline"

One week post-injury, the ipsilateral phrenic nerve exhibited no respiratory-related activity indicating a functionally complete hemisection.

Therefore, we examined the effect of spinal hemisection (C2) on respiratory-like activity bilaterally using the brainstem-spinal cord preparation from neonatal rats (0-4 days). Spontaneous crossed phrenic activity (respiratory-like activity recorded from the ipsilateral C4 or C5 ventral roots following C2 hemisection) was observed in an age-dependent manner; younger preparations exhibited more than older preparations. Increasing drive (increasing [K+] or superfusion of theophylline) either increased or induced crossed phrenic activity.

Phrenic nerve (PhN) or diaphragmatic activity ipsilateral to hemisection can occasionally be induced acutely following hemisection by respiratory stressors (i.e., hypercapnia, asphyxia, contralateral phrenicotomy) and becomes spontaneously active days-to-weeks later. These investigations, however, are potentially confounded by the use of anesthesia, which may suppress spontaneously-active crossed phrenic pathways. Experiments were performed on vecuronium-paralyzed, unanesthetized, decerebrate adult male rats and whole PhN activity recorded continuously before, during, and after high cervical hemisection at the C-1 spinal level. Crossed phrenic activity recovered spontaneously over minutes-to-hours with maximal recovery of 11.8 +/- 3.1% (m +/- SE) in the PhN ipsilateral to hemisection. Additionally, there was a significant increase in PhN activity contralateral to hemisection of 221.0 +/- 40.4% (m +/- SE); since animals were artificially-ventilated, these changes likely represent an increase in central respiratory drive. These results underscore the state-dependence of crossed bulbophrenic projections and suggest that unanesthetized models may be more sensitive in detecting acute recovery of respiratory output following spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, our results may suggest an important role for a group of C-1-C-2 neurons exhibiting respiratory-related activity, spared by the higher level of hemisection. These units may function as relays of polysynaptic bulbophrenic pathways and/or provide excitatory drive to phrenic motoneurons.

Preliminary findings indicate that activation of A(1) adenosine receptors can ameliorate trauma-induced death of central neurons. Other avenues of approach include the administration of agents which elevate local concentrations of adenosine at injury sites by inhibiting its metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase, rephosphorylation to adenosine triphosphate by adenosine kinase or re-uptake into adjacent cells. Amplification of the levels of endogenously released adenosine in such a 'site and event specific' fashion has the advantage of largely restricting the effect of such inhibitors to areas of injury-induced adenosine release. Another approach involving purinergic therapy has been applied to the problem of respiratory paralysis following high spinal cord injuries. In this instance, the adenosine antagonist theophylline has been used to enhance residual synaptic drive to spinal respiratory neurons by blocking adenosine Al receptors. Theophylline induced, and maintained, hemidiaphragmatic recovery for prolonged periods after C(2) spinal cord hemisection in rats and may prove to be beneficial in assisting respiration in spinal cord injury patients.","theophylline"

The objective of the present study was to assess quantitatively recovery after chronic theophylline administration, the effects of weaning from the drug, and the effects of the drug on adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression in adult rats subjected to a C2 hemisection. Rats subjected to a left C2 hemisection received theophylline orally for 3, 7, 12, or 30 days and were classified as 3D, 7D, 12D, or 30D respectively. Separate groups of 3D animals were weaned from drug administration for 7, 12, and 30 days before assessment of respiratory recovery. Additional groups of 7D and 12D animals were also weaned from drug administration for 7 and 12 days prior to assessment. Sham-operated controls received theophylline vehicle for similar periods. Quantitative assessment of recovered respiratory activity was conducted under standardized electrophysiologic recording conditions approximately 18 h after each drug application period. Serum theophylline analysis was conducted at the end of electrophysiologic recordings. Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression in the phrenic nucleus was assessed with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Chronic theophylline induced a dose-dependent effect on respiratory recovery over a serum theophylline range of 1.2-1.9 mug/ml. Recovery was characterized as respiratory-related activity in the left phrenic nerve and expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals under similar recording conditions. Recovered activity was 34.13 +/- 2.07, 55.89 +/- 2.96, 74.78 +/- 1.93, and 79.12 +/- 1.75% respectively in the 3D, 7D, 12D, and 30D groups. Theophylline-induced recovered activity persisted for as long as 30 days when drug administration was stopped and serum levels of the drug were virtually undetected. Furthermore, recovered activity in 3D and 7D animals increased significantly as a function of duration of weaning. Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression was not significantly changed by theophylline administration. It is concluded that recovery of respiratory function in C2-hemisected rats induced by chronic theophylline is unrelated to adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression. Recovered activity persists even when drug administration has been stopped. The significance of our results is that in the clinical application of theophylline to improve respiratory impairment, intermittent drug administration may be sufficient to engender and maintain the therapeutic benefits of the drug.

The alkylxanthines were selected based on their diverse pharmacologic profiles to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie functional recovery after spinal cord injury. To quantitatively assess the magnitude of recovery, electrophysiological experiments were conducted on pancuronium-paralyzed, hemisected animals under standardized recording conditions. The total absence of respiratory-related activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and paralyzed hemidiaphragm was used as the index of a functionally complete hemisection. Thereafter, drug-induced recovered activity in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection was quantified and expressed either as a percentage of contralateral phrenic nerve activity in the same animal prior to drug administration or as a percentage of predrug activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals. With either approach, theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced respiratory-related recovered activity. Enprofylline, a potent bronchodilator, and 8(p-Sulfophenyl)theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist with limited access to the central nervous system, were ineffective. Maximal recovery was attained with theophylline (5-15 mg/kg) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 mg/kg). At these doses, theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline induced recovery that was 70.0 +/- 2.5 and 69.3 +/- 4.1% of predrug contralateral nerve activity respectively. When expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude changed to 32.9 +/- 4.9 and 35.7 +/- 6.9%, respectively.

Previous studies have shown that chronic oral administration of theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an adenosine receptor antagonist, can restore function to the quiescent phrenic nerve and hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to hemisection. Both of these actions of theophylline result in an increase in 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, the chronic theophylline-mediated respiratory recovery persists long after the animals have been weaned from the drug. To date, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the recovery induced by theophylline are still not known. Since theophylline has two modes of action, in the present study we tested whether chronic administration of pentoxifylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 specific inhibitor, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an adenosine A I receptor antagonist, would induce recovery similar to that induced by theophylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats following a left C2 spinal cord lesion. Recovery of left phrenic nerve activity was assessed at 5 or 10 days after the last drug administrations to assess the persistent nature of the recovery. Pentoxifylline, rolipram and DPCPX, all capable of modulating 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels, brought about long-term respiratory recovery in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the left C2 lesion at 5 and 10 days after the last drug administration.

Before drug administration, the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection showed no respiratory-related activity due to the disruption of the descending bulbospinal respiratory pathways by spinal cord hemisection. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a serotonin precursor, was administrated intravenously. 5-HTP induced time- and dose-dependent increases in respiratory recovery in the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to hemisection. Although the 5-HTP-induced recovery was initially accompanied by an increase in activity in the contralateral phrenic nerve, suggesting an increase in descending respiratory drive, the recovery persisted well after activity in the contralateral nerve returned to predrug levels. 5-HTP-induced effects were reversed by a serotonin receptor antagonist, methysergide. Because experiments were conducted on animals subjected to C-2 spinal cord hemisection, the recovery was most likely mediated by the activation of a latent respiratory pathway spared by the spinal cord injury.

In group 2 animals, respiratory activity was induced in the nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection and enhanced in the contralateral phrenic nerve for up to 3 h after a single standard dose of theophylline (15 mg/kg).

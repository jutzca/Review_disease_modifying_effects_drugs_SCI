There is little controversy over the practice of using steroids in the treatment of optic neuritis-it is well established that intravenous steroid treatment can speed visual recovery but does not alter final visual function. However, there is controversy surrounding the acceptable routes of administration, dosage, and course of treatment. Additionally, the typical patient with optic neuritis is young and otherwise healthy, and thus is likely to tolerate steroids well. In ischemic and traumatic causes of optic neuropathies, the initial injury is not inflammatory, but damage may be compounded by secondary injury due to resultant inflammation and swelling in the confined space of the optic canal. Steroids have been considered as a means of minimizing inflammation and swelling, and thus minimizing the secondary injury that results. However, the use of steroids in traumatic and ischemic optic neuropathies is highly controversial-the evidence for the efficacy of treatment with steroids is insufficient to show that there is significant benefit. Additionally, patients with these conditions are more likely to have comorbidities that make them vulnerable to significant adverse events with the use of steroids. In this article, we attempt to analyze the current state of the literature regarding the use of steroids in the treatment of optic neuropathies, specifically optic neuritis, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and traumatic optic neuropathy.","triamcinolone"

In autopsy material from progressive MS patients, RGMa was found in active and chronic lesions, as well as in normal-appearing gray and white matter, and was expressed by cellular meningeal infiltrates. Levels of soluble RGMa in the cerebrospinal fluid were decreased in progressive MS patients successfully treated with intrathecal corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TCA), showing functional improvements. In vitro, RGMa monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reversed RGMa-mediated neurite outgrowth inhibition and chemorepulsion. In animal models of CNS damage and MS, RGMa antibody stimulated regeneration and remyelination of damaged nerve fibers, accelerated functional recovery, and protected the retinal nerve fiber layer as measured by clinically relevant optic coherence tomography. These data suggest that targeting RGMa is a promising strategy to improve functional recovery in MS patients.","triamcinolone"

In a prospective, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial, 396 patients with severe head injury were randomized to a steroid group (n = 187) receiving 200 mg triamcinolone acetonide (Volon A soluble) i.v. within 4 h after trauma, followed by 3 x 40 mg/day i.v. for 4 days, and 3 x 20 mg/day i.v. for a further 4 days, and a placebo group (n = 209) receiving injections which did not contain any active drug. The placebo group was subjected to the same standard treatment procedures. Clinical features were not different between the groups upon admission to hospital. Subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, and focal supratentorial contusion were among the most frequent diagnoses. The result of treatment with triamcinolone was assessed at discharge from the hospital and at 1 year after trauma, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Differences in favor of steroid treatment could be detected with regard to the patients' condition at discharge (P = 0.0634). More patients with steroids had a good recovery (49.2% vs 40.7%), and fewer died (16.0% vs 21.5%). Differences in outcome were even more pronounced (P < 0.0145) in patients with a focal lesion and a Glasgow Coma Score on admission of < 8 (n = 93). In this group, 34.8% of the patients made a good recovery, as against 21.3% of the placebo group; mortality was also lower in the verum group (19.6% vs 38.3%). The results indicate that a major subgroup of patients with severe head injury benefits from early administration of triamcinolone. Efficacy of the treatment can be expected, in particular, in patients with a focal cerebral lesion and a Glasgow Coma Score of < 8 on admission. Administration of steroids beginning at the scene of an accident would therefore be beneficial in these cases.","triamcinolone"

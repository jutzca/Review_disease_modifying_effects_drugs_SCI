In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure.","urokinase"

Cellular reactions at the lesion site affect axonal regrowth. We compared gene regulation in optic nerve (ON) and sciatic nerve (SN) crush lesions in adult rats by cDNA array analysis, quantitative RTPCR and immunohistochemistry, focusing on the primary lesion site rather than the proximal or distal nerve stump. Four days after injury, identical gene regulation in ON and SN lesions was found for 19/1185 genes (15 up, 4 down). In contrast, tissue-specific regulations were identified for 48 genes in ON and 50 genes in SN crush lesions. Among these, in the ON many genes were downregulated (23 up, 25 down) whereas upregulation predominated in SN lesions (43 up, 7 down), especially for signaling, metabolism, and translation/transcription-related genes. In ON lesions aquaporin 4 downregulation corresponded to a transient loss of astrocytes. Tissue-type plasminogen activator was upregulated in the lesion and distal stump of SN while the urokinase-type plasminogen activator was upregulated only in the ON lesion indicating differences in local proteolysis between the systems. Typical neuronal genes were regulated at the crush site comprising neurotransmitter genes in ON and actin cytoskeleton-related genes in the SN. The differential orchestration of local gene regulation has implications for axonal regeneration in central nervous system lesions. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel","urokinase"

A genetic approach has been used to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this synaptic plasticity. Knockout mice lacking different genes in the plasminogen activator/plasmin system demonstrate that expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is required during the critical 1-2 h delay period following C2-hemisection for the acquisition of a good CPP response. uPA knockout mice fail to show the structural remodeling of phrenic motorneuron synapses that underlie the CPP response. Potential mechanisms by which uPA may promote phrenic motorneuron synaptic plasticity have been explored. Expression of uPA receptors, uPAR and LRP-1, are both up-regulated in the ipsilateral phrenic motor nucleus (PMN) following C2-hemisection. A comparison of microarray data and real-time PCR analysis of mRNAs induced in the PMN after hemisection indicate potential cell signaling pathways downstream of uPA's; interaction with these cell surface receptors in the PMN. Knowledge of these uPA-mediated signaling pathways may identify potential means for the pharmacological activation of the synaptic plasticity required for recovery of phrenic motorneuron activity.

A genetic approach using knockout mice lacking various genes in the plasminogen activator/plasmin system has shown that induction of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is required during the first hour after a C2-hemisection for the acquisition of the CPP response. The uPA knockout mice do not show the structural remodeling of phrenic motor neuron synapses characteristic of the CPP response. As shown here uPA acts in a cell signaling manner via binding to its receptor uPAR rather than as a protease, since uPAR knockout mice or knock-in mice possessing a modified uPA that is unable to bind to uPAR both fail to generate a CPP and recover respiratory function. Microarray data and real-time PCR analysis of mRNAs induced in the phrenic motor nucleus after C2-hemisection in C57Bl/6 mice as compared to uPA knockout mice indicate a potential cell signaling cascade downstream possibly involving beta-integrin and Src, and other pathways. Identification of these uPA-mediated signaling pathways may provide the opportunity to pharmacologically upregulate the synaptic plasticity necessary for recovery of phrenic motoneuron activity following cervical spinal cord injury.","urokinase"

Our previous studies indicate that uPA and uPAR expression increase in the ischemic brain during the recovery phase from an acute ischemic injury and that uPA binding to uPAR promotes neurological recovery after an acute ischemic stroke. Here, we used male mice genetically deficient on either uPA (uPA(-/-)) or uPAR (uPAR(-/-)) or with a four-amino acid substitution into the growth factor domain of uPA that abrogates its binding to uPAR (Plat(GFDhu/GFDhu)) to investigate the mechanism whereby uPA promotes neurorepair in the ischemic brain. We found that neurons release uPA and astrocytes recruit uPAR to their plasma membrane during the recovery phase from a hypoxic injury and that binding of neuronal uPA to astrocytic uPAR induces astrocytic activation by a mechanism that does not require plasmin generation, but instead is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-regulated phosphorylation of the signal transducerandactivator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We report that uPA/uPAR binding is necessary and sufficient to induce astrocytic activation in the ischemic brain and that astrocytes activated by neuronal uPA promote synaptic recovery in neurons that have sufferedan acute hypoxic injury via a mechanism mediated by astrocytic thrombospondin-1(TSP1) and synaptic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). In summary, we show that uPA/uPAR-induced astrocytic activation mediates a cross talk between astrocytes and injured neurons that promotes synaptic recovery in the ischemic brain.","urokinase"

Theoretically, spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can be rendered more permissive to axon growth by either suppressing synthesis of misaligned, fibrotic scar tissue and associated axon growth inhibitors, or enzymatically degrading them. We have previously shown that acute infusion of human recombinant decorin core protein into discreet stab injuries of the rat dorsal column pathways effected a major suppression of inflammation, astrogliosis, and multiple axon growth inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which combined to promote rapid axon growth across the injury site. The high efficiency of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) core protein suppression (similar to 90%) suggested that decorin may promote CSPG degradation in addition to suppressing CSPG synthesis. As the serine protease plasmin can degrade axon growth inhibitory CSPGs (neurocan and phosphacan) and its zymogen, plasmininogen is synthesized by microglia, we have investigated whether decorin treatment of acute SCIs and cultured adult spinal cord microglia can increase plasminogen/plasmin synthesis. Infusion of hr-decorin over the first 8 days post-SCI induced 10- and 17-fold increases in plasminogen and plasmin protein levels, respectively, within sites of injury and a threefold increase in microglial plasminogen mRNA in vitro. In addition to potentially degrading multiple axon growth inhibitory components of the glial scar, plasmin is known to play major roles in activating neurotrophins and promoting central nervous system (CNS) plasticity. The wider implications of decorin induction of plasmin in the injured spinal cord for axon regeneration, and recovery of function at acute and chronic time points post-SCI are reviewed.","urokinase"

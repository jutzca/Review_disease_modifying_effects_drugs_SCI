However, anuran amphibians win over such pathological condition by the virtue of regeneration abilities. The tail of anuran tadpoles therefore allures researchers to study spinal cord injury and self-repair process. In the present study, we inflicted injury to the spinal cord by means of surgical transection of the tail and investigated the self-repair activity in the tadpoles of the Indian tree frog Polypedates maculatus. We also demonstrate for the first time by immunofluorescence localization the expression pattern of Fibroblast Growth Factorl (FGF1) during spinal cord regeneration which has not been documented earlier in anurans. FGF1, bearer of the mitogenic and neurotrophic properties seems to be expressed by progenitor cells that facilitate regeneration. Spinal cord during tail regeneration in P. maculatus attains functional recovery within a span of 2 weeks thus enabling the organism to survive in an aquatic medium till metamorphosis. Moreover, during the course of spinal cord regeneration in the regenerating tail, melanocytes showed an interesting behaviour as these neural crest derivatives were missing near the early regenerates until their reappearance where they were positioned in close proximity with the regenerated spinal cord as in the normal tail.","vitamin_a"

In mammals, damage incurred in the spinal cord is aggravated by the enlargement of lesion due to delayed cell death. However, in amphibians, the injured spinal cord regenerates within a few weeks and it becomes functionally normal. In this study, the profile of apoptosis in the crush-injured spinal cord of Xenopus tadpole was examined by TUNEL method and DNA laddering analysis. The number of TUNEL-positive cells reached to the peak level between 6 and 12 hours after injury and decreased subsequently. The DNA laddering pattern was consistent with the TUNEL profiles. Since retinoic acid (RA) is an important regulatory molecule in the regenerative process, we are interested to know if there would be a change in the gene expression profile for RA synthesis during spinal cord regeneration. Since retinaldehyde dehydrogenases are known to convert retinal to retinoic acid, we examined the gene expression patterns of the Xenopus retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 (XRALDH2) in the injured spinal cord of Xenopus tadpole to address this question. XRALDH2 expression began to be detected in the gray matter at 6 hours after spinal cord injury (SCI) and reached to the peak level at 12 hours after SCI, and then decreased subsequently. Interestingly, strong expression domain of XRALDH2 was noted between 4th and 6th somites aparting cranially from the injury site. The present results indicate that RA plays an important role in the early phase of spinal cord regeneration of Xenopus tadpole.","vitamin_a"

In the peripheral tissues, degenerative diseases create a neurotoxic metabolic milieu that either causes neurodegeneration or fails to sustain regenerative growth and reinnervation of injured/diseased tissues. Encapsulation of cells producing neurotrophic factors can augment axon growth and neuron survival; however, sustained innervation in vivo requires a combination of factors promoting axon growth and guidance pathway that are released in a tissue-specific context. Using novel encapsulation techniques and genetic tools, we manipulated retinoic acid generating enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 al(Aldhla1) in adipocytes that are capable of promoting growth and innervation of white adipose tissue by sympathetic neurons. Aldhla1(-/-) adipocytes secrete molecules that regulate axon guidance and markedly stimulate neurite outgrowth in vitro and in vivo. Based on studies with natural and synthetic RAR agonists and antagonists, gene microarray and nanostring arrays, we concluded that ephrin A5/ephrin A4 is a downstream pathway regulated by Aldhlal. Encapsulation of Aldhla1(-/-) adipocytes into alginate poly-L-lysine microcapsules induced functional innervation of adipose tissue in obese wild-type mice. We propose that encapsulated Aldhla1(-/-) adipocytes could provide a therapeutic solution for the reinnervation of damaged tissues.","vitamin_a"

Recent reports pointed to an important role of retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of the vitamin A, in the induction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during human and mouse development, however, it is unknown whether RA plays a role in maintaining BSCB integrity under the pathological conditions such as SCI. In this study, we investigated the BSCB protective role of RA both in vivo and in vitro and demonstrated that autophagy are involved in the BSCB protective effect of RA. Our data show that RA attenuated BSCB permeability and also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as P120, beta-catenin, Occludin and Claudin5 after injury in vivo as well as in brain microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, RA administration improved functional recovery of the rat model of trauma. We also found that RA could significantly increase the expression of LC3-II and decrease the expression of p62 both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, combining RA with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) partially abolished its protective effect on the BSCB and exacerbated the loss of tight junctions. Together, our studies indicate that RA improved functional recovery in part by the prevention of BSCB disruption via the activation of autophagic flux after SCI.","vitamin_a"

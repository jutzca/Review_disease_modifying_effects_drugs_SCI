A key component of SCI is the generation of free radicals that contributes to the high levels of oxidative stress observed. This study investigates whether dietary supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) improves functional recovery after SCI. Female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either with a normal diet or a dietary regiment supplemented with vitamin E (51 IU/g) for eight weeks. The rats were subsequently exposed either to a contusive SCI or sham operation, and evaluated using standard functional behavior analysis. We report that the rats that consumed the vitamin E-enriched diet showed an accelerated bladder recovery and significant improvements in locomotor function relative to controls, as determined by residual volumes and Basso, Beatie, and Bresnaham BBB scores, respectively. Interestingly, the prophylactic dietary intervention did not preserve neurons in the ventral horn of injured rats, but it significantly increased the numbers of oligodendrocytes. Vitamin E supplementation attenuated the depression of the H-reflex (a typical functional consequence of SCI) while increasing the levels of supraspinal serotonin immunoreactivity. Our findings support the potential complementary use of vitamin E to ameliorate sensory and autonomic dysfunctions associated with spinal cord injury, and identified promising new cellular and functional targets of its neuroprotective effects.","vitamin_e"

Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin C and vitamin E on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury in animal models. Data Sources: Two authors independently collected the records of relevant articles published in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science through November 2018. Study Selection: All studies conducted in animal models to evaluate the therapeutic effects of vitamin C or vitamin E or both on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury were included. Studies that lacked a control group or a standard treatment, lacked an assessment of motor function, included genetically modified/engineered animals, included animals pretreated with vitamin C or vitamin E, or combined vitamin treatment with other methods, such as cell therapies, were excluded. Data Extraction: Data from 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: Daily supplementation with vitamin C (P< 0.0001) and vitamin E (P< 0.0001) significantly improved the recovery of motor function in animals affected by spinal cord injury. Vitamin C supplementation is effective only when administered intraperitoneally (P< 0.0001). Concurrent supplementation with both vitamins does not show better efficacy than treatment with either one alone. Conclusion: Administration of vitamin C and vitamin E in animal models of spinal cord injury significantly improves the recovery of motor function.","vitamin_e"

In the present study, experiments were carried out to evaluate the neuro-protective effect of the palm vitamin E on locomotor function and morphological damages induced SCI. Seventy-two male rats (Sprague-Dawley) were randomly divided into four groups: sham (laminectomy); control (supplemented with the palm vitamin E at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day); untreated-SCI (partial crush, 30-33% for 20 sec); treated-SCI (partial crush, 30-33% for 20 sec supplemented with the palm vitamin E at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day). The treatment with the palm vitamin E significantly improved the hind limb locomotor function, reduced the histopathological changes and the morphological damage in the spinal cord.

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacologic agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger alpha tocopherol (i.e., vitamin E) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurologic recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for the treatment of acute neural injury. The glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant dosages, improves chronic neurologic recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of methylprednisolone is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions. Novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids have been developed that are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than methylprednisolone. One of these, U74006F or tirilazad mesylate, has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials. Compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-aminosteroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) have also recently shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds adds further support to the concept that lipid peroxidation is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacologic neuroprotection.","vitamin_e"

Although these membrane lipid disturbances are thought to contribute to the paralysis that occur subsequent to spinal cord injury, such a correlation has not been demonstrated directly. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to test the capacity of alpha tocopherol, the major lipid antioxidant in cellular membranes and a compound that limits the injury-induced lipid hydrolysis and peroxidation in spinal cord tissue, to promote functional recovery in a static loading model of spinal cord injury. After laminectomy, the L2 spinal cord of cats was compressed with 180 g for 5 min. For 5 days before injury and for 5 days postinjury, treated cats received orally 1000 IUD-alpha tocopherol acetate daily. Control cats were similarly injured but untreated. All cats were blindly evaluated weekly for 4 weeks for their neurologic recovery based on an 11 point behavioral scale that assessed walking, running, and stair climbing. By the second postinjury week, alpha tocopherol-pretreated cats demonstrated significantly better recovery than untreated controls. By 4 weeks, treated cats had recovered 72% of their preinjury function as compared with 20% for untreated controls, i.e., a 3.5-fold difference. These results strongly suggest that lipid peroxidation and/or hydrolysis is primarily involved in the genesis of posttraumatic paralysis and that alpha tocopherol exerts its protection of injured spinal cord tissue, at least in part, by its antioxidant and/or antilipolytic activity.","vitamin_e"

In the first series of experiments, the brain concentration of vitamin E, which was unaffected by ischemia without reperfusion, was decreased after 2 hours of reperfusion by an average of 60% in vehicle-treated animals compared with sham-operated animals; in the U-74006F-treated gerbils, the 2-hour postischemic vitamin E loss was only 27% (p < 0.002 different from vehicle-treated animals). In the second series, unilateral carotid artery occlusion produced a decrease in the cortical extracellular calcium concentration from 1.05 mM before ischemia to 0.11 mM by the end of the ischemic episode in both vehicle- and U-74006F-treated gerbils. After 2 hours of reperfusion, the calcium concentration had recovered to only 0.22 mM in the vehicle-treated animals compared with 0.56 mM in the U-74006F-treated group (p < 0.01). Cortical blood flow, mean arterial blood pressure, and blood gases did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. Administration of only the immediate postreperfusion dose (i.e., no pretreatment) also significantly improved the recovery of cortical extracellular calcium.

In vitro studies suggest that tirilazad exerts its antioxidant activity by multiple mechanisms including: increasing membrane stability, scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals, reducing LP-induced arachidonic acid release, decreased formation or scavenging of hydroxyl radicals, and maintenance of the levels of endogenous vitamin E. The major site of action appears to be the blood-brain barrier based upon its known localization in cerebrovascular endothelium and numerous studies showing an attenuation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), injury, and ischemia-induced blood-brain barrier permeability. Tirilazad has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in multiple preclinical models of spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and focal cerebral ischemia, as measured by a decrease in cerebral vasospasm, blood-brain barrier compromise, post-traumatic ischemia, edema, ischemic neuronal necrosis and infarction, and improved neurological recovery. This efficacy is correlated with a reduction in markers of oxygen radical-induced LP. Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing in spinal cord and head injury, SAH, and ischemic stroke. Initial results from a European/Australian/New Zealand trial in SAH have shown a significant decrease in mortality and an increase in the incidence of good recovery.","vitamin_e"

Thus, numerous studies have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacological agents with lipid antioxidant activity in models of spinal cord and brain injury. Intensive pretreatment of animals with the endogenous lipid peroxyl radical scavenger vitamin E (i.e., alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to decrease posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia and to enhance chronic neurological recovery. However, the slow CNS tissue uptake of vitamin E requires chronic dosing, making it an impractical agent for treatment of acute neural-injury. The glucocorticoid steroid, methylprednisolone (MP), has been shown to possess significant antioxidant efficacy and, when administered to animals or humans in antioxidant doses, improves chronic neurological recovery after spinal cord injury. This activity of MP is independent of the steroid's glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions, as evidenced by the efficacy of the novel antioxidant 21-aminosteroids, which are devoid of glucocorticoid activity but have greater antioxidant efficacy than MP. One of these, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F), has been shown to be effective in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury and is currently the subject of phase II clinical trials. Recently, compounds that combine the amino functionality of the 21-aminosteroids with the peroxyl radical scavenging chromanol portion of vitamin E (i.e., 2-methylaminochromans) also have shown promise as neuroprotective agents. The consistent benefit afforded by antioxidant compounds further supports the concept that LP is an important therapeutic target for acute pharmacological neuroprotection.","vitamin_e"

The purpose of this study was to probe the possible modulation of autophagy and apoptosis from the injured spinal cord and neurons by zinc administration. It was shown that zinc significantly induced the level of Beclinl and LC3B by activating adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. In addition, zinc suppressed apoptosis in the injured spinal cord. Taken together, these findings suggested that zinc through promoting neurons autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis.","zinc"

Regulating the inflammatory response can be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the prognosis of SCI. Zinc has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotective effect in experimental spinal cord injury models. In this study, we aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect of zinc through the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Method Allen's method was used to establish an SCI model in C57BL/6J mice. The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), Nissl staining were employed to confirm the protective effect of zinc on neuronal survival and functional recovery in vivo. Western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy-related proteins. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the occurrence of zinc-induced autophagy. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP polarized BV2 cells to a proinflammatory phenotype. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) were chosen to explore the relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy. A coimmunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the ubiquitination of the NLRP3 protein. Results Our data showed that zinc significantly promoted motor function recovery after SCI. In vivo, zinc treatment inhibited the protein expression level of NLRP3 while increasing the level of autophagy. These effects were fully validated by the polarization of BV2 cells to a proinflammatory phenotype. The results showed that when 3-MA and BafA1 were applied, the promotion of autophagy by zinc was blocked and that the inhibitory effect of zinc on NLRP3 was reversed. Furthermore, co-IP confirmed that the promotion of autophagy by zinc also activated the protein expression of ubiquitin and suppressed high levels of NLRP3. Conclusion Zinc provides neuroprotection by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome through autophagy and ubiquitination after SCI.","zinc"

Moderate contusion, dislocation, and distraction SCIs were surgically induced in Sprague Dawley male rats (n = 6 for each type of injury). Their spinal cords were harvested 8 weeks post injury with 5 normal weight-matched rats. The spinal cords were cut, stained with anti-NeuN antibody and fluorescent Nissl, and imaged in the dorsal and ventral horns at various distances to the epicenter. Neurons in the images were automatically counted using an algorithm that was designed to filter non-soma-like objects based on morphological characteristics (size, solidity, circular pattern) and check the remaining objects for the double-stained nucleus/ cell body features (brightness variation, brightness distribution, color). To validate the automated method, some of the images were randomly selected for manual counting. The number of surviving cells that were automatically measured by the algorithm was found to be correlated with the values that were manually measured by 2 observers (P <.001) with similar differences (P >.05). Neurons in the dorsal and ventral horns were reduced after the SCIs (P <.05). Dislocation and distraction, respectively, caused the most severe damage to the ventral horn neurons especially near the epicenter and the most extensive and uniform damage to the dorsal horn neurons (P <.05). Our method was proved to be reliable, which is suitable for studying different types of SCI.","zinc"

Conditional genetic deletion of PTEN results in robust CNS axon regrowth, while PTEN repression with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) improves regeneration but to a lesser extent, likely due to suboptimal PTEN mRNA knockdown using this approach. Here we employed the CRISPR/dCas9 system to repress PTEN transcription in neural cells. We targeted the PTEN proximal promoter and 5 ' untranslated region with dCas9 fused to the repressor protein Kruppel-associated box (KRAB). dCas9-KRAB delivered in a lentiviral vector with one CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) achieved potent and specific PTEN repression in human cell line models and neural cells derived from human iPSCs, and induced histone (H)3 methylation and deacetylation at the PTEN promoter. The dCas9-KRAB system outperformed a combination of four shRNAs targeting the PTEN transcript, a construct previously used in CNS injury models. The CRISPR system also worked more effectively than shRNAs for Pten repression in rat neural crest-derived PC-12 cells, and enhanced neurite outgrowth after nerve growth factor stimulation. PTEN silencing with CRISPR/dCas9 epigenetic editing may provide a new option for promoting axon regeneration and functional recovery after CNS trauma.","zinc"

BoNT-A blocks the release of acetylcholine, thereby decreasing the ability of a spastic muscle to generate forceful contraction, which results in a temporal local weakness and the atrophy of targeted muscles. BoNT-A-induced temporal muscle weakness has been used to manage skeletal muscle spasticity, such as poststroke spasticity, cerebral palsy, and cervical dystonia. However, the combined effect of treadmill exercise and BoNT-A treatment is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that for rats, following BoNT-A injection in the gastrocnemius muscle, treadmill running improved the recovery of the sciatic functional index (SFI), muscle contraction strength, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and area. Treadmill training had no influence on gastrocnemius mass that received BoNT-A injection, but it improved the maximal contraction force of the gastrocnemius, and upregulation of GAP-43, IGF-1, Myo-D, Myf-5, myogenin, and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits alpha and beta was found following treadmill training.

Sciatic nerves of double transgenic mice, overexpressing both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) genes, and FVB/N wild type mice were transected and immediately resutured. Evaluation of autotomy and functional recovery was carried out during 4-week follow-up. We found markedly less severe autotomy in transgenic animals, although the onset of autotomy was significantly delayed in control mice. Interestingly, neuroma formation at the injury site was significantly more prominent in transgenic animals. Sciatic function index outcome was better in transgenic mice than in wild-type group. Histological evaluation revealed no statistically significant differences in the number of GAP-43-positive growth cones and macrophages in the distal stump of the transected nerve between groups. However, in transgenic animals, the regenerating axons were arranged more chaotically. The number of Schwann cells in the distal stump of the transected nerves was significantly lower in transgenic mice. The number of surviving motoneurons was markedly decreased in transgenic group. We measured also the atrophy of denervated muscles and found it decreased in APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice. Taken together, in this model of Down syndrome, we observed increased neuroma formation and decreased autotomy after peripheral nerve injury. Our findings suggest that APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice are less sensitive for neuropathic pain associated with neuroma. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","zinc"

Injured animals were given glucose and zinc gluconate (ZnG; 30 mg/kg) for the first time at 2 h after injury, the same dose was given for 3 days. A cytokine antibody array was used to screen changes in inflammation at the site of SCI lesion. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the distribution of cytokines. Magnetic beads were also used to isolate cells from the site of SCI lesion. We then investigated the effect of Zinc on apoptosis after SCI by Transferase UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining and Western Blotting. Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) scores and immunofluorescence were employed to investigate neuronal apoptosis and functional recovery. We found that the administration of zinc significantly increased the expression of 19 cytokines in the SCI lesion. Of these, G-CSF was shown to be the most elevated cytokine and was secreted by microglia/macrophages (M/Ms) via the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway after SCI. Increased levels of G-CSF at the SCI lesion reduced the level of neuronal apoptosis after SCI, thus promoting functional recovery. Collectively, our results indicate that the administration of zinc increases the expression of G-CSF secreted by M/Ms, which then leads to reduced levels of neuronal apoptosis after SCI.","zinc"

Although the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood, previous studies from our laboratory indicate that inhibiting activation of the nuclear factor-B transcription factor in astrocytes reduces white matter damage and improves functional recovery following spinal cord injury. In the current study, we demonstrate that activation of the nuclear factor-B transcription factor within astrocytes results in a significant increase in oligodendrocyte death following trauma by reducing extracellular zinc levels and inducing glutamate excitotoxicity. By using an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (CNQX), we show that astroglial nuclear factor-B-mediated oligodendrocyte death is dependent on glutamate signaling despite no change in extracellular glutamate concentrations. Further analysis demonstrated a reduction in levels of extracellular zinc in astrocyte cultures with functional nuclear factor-B signaling following trauma. Cotreatment of oligodendrocytes with glutamate and zinc showed a significant increase in oligodendrocyte toxicity under low-zinc conditions, suggesting that the presence of zinc at specific concentrations can prevent glutamate excitotoxicity. These studies demonstrate a novel role for zinc in regulating oligodendrocyte excitotoxicity and identify new therapeutic targets to prevent oligodendrocyte cell death in central nervous system trauma and disease.

Delivery of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an efficient ROS scavenger, to the site of injury can mitigate SCI-induced oxidative stress and tissue damage. Towards this goal catalytically active nanoformulations of SOD1 (""nanozymes"") are developed as a modality for treatment of SCI. Along with the cross-linked polyion complex of SOD1 with polycation poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-polylysine (single-coat (SC) nanozyme), we introduce for the first time the chemically cross-linked multilayer polyion complex in which SOD1 is first incorporated into a polyion complex with polycation, then coated by anionic block copolymer, PEG-polyglutamic acid (double-coat (DC) nanozyme). We developed DC nanozymes with high enzymatic activity and ability to retain and protect SOD1 under physiological conditions. Pharmacokinetic study revealed that DC nanozymes significantly prolonged circulation of active SOD1 in the blood stream compared to free SOD1 or SC nanozymes (half-life was 60 vs 6 min). Single intravenous injection of DC nanozymes (5 kU of SOD1/kg) improved the recovery of locomotor functions in rats with moderate SCI, along with reduction of swelling, concomitant compression of the spinal cord and formation of post-traumatic cysts. Thus, based on the testing in a rodent model the SOD1 DC nanozymes are promising modality for scavenging ROS, decreasing inflammation and edema, and improving recovery after SCI.","zinc"

Many therapeutic compounds have shown promise in pre-clinical studies, but clinical trials have been largely unsuccessful. P-glycoprotein (Pgp, Abcb1b) is a drug efflux transporter of the blood-spinal cord barrier that limits spinal cord penetration of blood-borne xenobiotics. Pathological Pgp upregulation in diseases such as cancer causes heightened resistance to a broad variety of therapeutic drugs. Importantly, several drugs that have been evaluated for the treatment of SCI, such as riluzole, are known substrates of Pgp. We therefore examined whether Pgp-mediated pharmacoresistance diminishes delivery of riluzole to the injured spinal cord. Following moderate contusion injury at T10 in male Sprague-Dawley rats, we observed a progressive, spatial spread of increased Pgp expression from 3 days to 10 months post-SCI. Spinal cord uptake of i.p.-delivered riluzole was significantly reduced following SCI in wild type but not Abcb1-aknockout rats, highlighting a critical role for Pgp in mediating drug resistance following SCI. Because inflammation can drive Pgp upregulation, we evaluated the ability of the new generation dual anti-inflammatory drug licofelone to promote spinal cord delivery of riluzole following SCI. We found that licofelone both reduced Pgp expression and enhanced riluzole bioavailability within the lesion site at 72 h post-SCI. This work highlights Pgp-mediated drug resistance as an important obstacle to therapeutic drug delivery for SCI, and suggests licofelone as a novel combinatorial treatment strategy to enhance therapeutic drug delivery to the injured spinal cord.","zinc"

Although pre-clinical studies have identified a number of manipulations that stimulate some degree of axon growth after CNS damage, the extent of recovery remains quite limited, emphasizing the need for improved therapies. Here, we used traumatic injury to the mouse optic nerve as a model system to test the effects of combining several treatments that have recently been found to promote axon regeneration without the risks associated with manipulating known tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The treatments tested here include TPEN, a chelator of mobile (free) zinc (Zn-2 (+)); shRNA against the axon growth-suppressing transcription factor Klf9; and the atypical growth factor oncomodulin combined with a cAMP analog. Whereas some combinatorial treatments produced only marginally stronger effects than the individual treatments alone, co-treatment with TPEN and Klf9 knockdown had a substantially stronger effect on axon regeneration than either one alone. This combination also promoted a high level of cell survival at longer time points. Thus, Zn-2 (+) chelation in combination with Klf9 suppression holds therapeutic potential for promoting axon regeneration after optic nerve injury, and may also be effective for treating other CNS injuries and diseases.","zinc"

These magnetically labeled cells (Mag-Cells) can migrate because ZnMNPs generate sufficiently strong mechanical forces to overcome steric hindrances in the brain tissues.

All these effects were inhibited by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of HO-1, and LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt. Moreover, TMP inhibited the decrease of mRNA expression of HO-1 which was suppressed by ZnPP and LY294002. TMP inhibited the decrease of Akt phosphorylation in rats after SCI, which was suppressed by LY294002, but not ZnPP. Furthermore, LY294002, but not ZnPP, significantly inhibited TMP-induced increase of mRNA expression of Nrf2 and DNA binding activity of Nrf2 in HO-1 promoters in rat model of SCI. The data suggested that TMP induced neuro-protective effects against injury of spinal cord through the activation of Akt/ Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These results have appointed a new path toward the understanding of pathogenesis and TMP-related therapy of SCI and associated neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the protective function of Sal A on preserving the role of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) after spinal cord injury (SCI) is unclear. The present study investigated the effects and mechanisms of Sal A (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) on BSCB permeability at different time-points after compressive SCI in rats. Compared to the SCI group, treatment with Sal A decreased the content of the Evans blue in the spinal cord tissue at 24 h post-SCI. The expression levels of tight junction proteins and HO-1 were remarkably increased, and that of p-caveolin-1 protein was greatly decreased after SCI Sal A. The effect of Sal A on the expression level of ZO-1, occluding, and p-caveolin-1 after SCI was blocked by the HO-1 inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP). Also, Sal A inhibited the level of apoptosis-related proteins and improved the motor function until 21 days after SCI. In addition, Sal A significantly increased the expression of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in the RBMECs under hypoxia. AntagomiR-101 markedly increased the RBMECs permeability and the expression of the Cu13 protein by targeting with 3'-UTR of its mRNA. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and HO-1 was significantly increased after agomiR-101 treatment. Therefore, Sal A could improve the recovery of neurological function after SCI, which could be correlated with the repair of BSCB integrity by the miR-101/Cul3/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a pleiotropic factor recognized for its pro-angiogenic properties; however, VEGF has recently been shown to provide neuroprotection. We hypothesized that delivery of AdV-ZFP-VEGF - an adenovirally delivered bio-engineered zinc-finger transcription factor that promotes endogenous VEGF-A expression - would result in angiogenesis, neuroprotection and functional recovery following SCI. This novel VEGF gene therapy induces the endogenous production of multiple VEGF-A isoforms; a critical factor for proper vascular development and repair. Briefly, female Wistar rats - under cyclosporin immunosuppression - received a 35 g clip-compression injury and were administered AdV-ZFP-VEGF or AdV-eGFP at 24 hours post-SCI. qRT-PCR and Western Blot analysis of VEGF-A mRNA and protein, showed significant increases in VEGF-A expression in AdV-ZFP-VEGF treated animals (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). Analysis of NF200, TUNEL, and RECA-1 indicated that AdV-ZFP-VEGF increased axonal preservation (p<0.05), reduced cell death (p<0.01), and increased blood vessels (p<0.01), respectively. Moreover, AdV-ZFP-VEGF resulted in a 10% increase in blood vessel proliferation (p<0.001). Catwalk (TM) analysis showed AdV-ZFP-VEGF treatment dramatically improves hindlimb weight support (p<0.05) and increases hindlimb swing speed (p<0.02) when compared to control animals. Finally, AdV-ZFP-VEGF administration provided a significant reduction in allodynia (p<0.01). Overall, the results of this study indicate that AdV-ZFP-VEGF administration can be delivered in a clinically relevant time-window following SCI (24 hours) and provide significant molecular and functional benefits.","zinc"

In this study, we determined the MMP-2 and 9 responses following hypoxic ischemia (HI) injury in the developing brain. First, we characterized the developmental changes of MMP activity in the rat brain from embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 120 (P120). MMP-2 activity was high from E18 to P3 and decreased with age (P <= 0.001), while MMP-9 activity was not detectable. MMP-2 immunoreactivity was closely associated with differentiating cortical plate and subplate neurons. Next we characterized the proteolytic changes after unilateral H; brain injury in 3- (P3) and 21- (P21) day-old rats. Zymography revealed that in the P21 rat brain, MMP-9 activity (150 and 92 kDa forms) was increased at 6 h and remained elevated 24 h post-injury in the ipsilateral injured hemisphere (P <= 0.001), whereas there was a gradual increase in MMP-2 (65 kDa) activity, reaching a peak at 5 days (P <= 0.001). Similarly, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) indicated significant elevations in MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA expression in the injured cortex (P <= 0.05) and hippocampus (P <= 0.05) at 1 and 5 days post-injury, respectively in the P21 rat brain. In the P3 rat brain, zymography results revealed that both pro (92 kDa) and cleaved (87 kDa) MMP-9 activities were upregulated in the ipsilateral injured hemisphere from 6 h to 1 day after injury (P <= 0.001). In contrast, cleaved MMP-2 (60 kDa) was only moderately upregulated at 6 h (P <= 0.01), while pro MMP-2 (65 kDa) levels were unaffected. MMP-9 mRNA expression was also increased at 6 h (P <= 0.05) following injury at P3, whereas MMP-2 expression remained unchanged compared with the uninjured contralateral hemisphere. Immunohistochemistry indicated that MMP-9 protein expression was localized predominantly to neurons and perivascular astrocytes in the affected regions at early time points, whereas MMP-2 was present on reactive astrocytes surrounding the infarct at later time points. Together, these results indicate that MMP-2 may be primarily associated with the development and differentiation of cortical plate neurons and wound recovery processes. Conversely, MMP-9 appeared to be associated with more acute processes during the period of lesion development. (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.","zinc"

This morbidity is attributed to the deposition of a dense scar at the injury site, the cellular components of which secrete axon growth inhibitory ligands that prevent severed axons reconnecting with denervated targets. Another complication of SCI is wound cavitation where a fluid filled cyst forms in the peri-lesion neuropil, enlarging over the first few months after injury and causes secondary axonal damage. Wound healing after SCI is accompanied by angiogenesis, which is regulated by angiogenic proteins, produced in response to oxygen deprivation. Necrosis in and about the SCI lesion sites may be suppressed by promoting angiogenesis and the resulting neuropil protection will enhance recovery after SCI. This review addresses the use of angiogenic/wound-healing related proteins including vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2 and transforming growth factor-beta to moderate necrosis and axon sparing after SCI, providing a conducive environment for growth essential to functional recovery.

To alleviate its impairments and seek for an effective remedy, mRNA differential display was used to investigate gene mRNA expression profiling in mice following SCI. A specific Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein, CIBZ, was discovered to implicate in the SCI process for the first time. Further researches indicated that CIBZ was extensively distributed in various tissues, and the expression level was highest in muscle, followed by spinal cord, large intestine, kidney, spleen, thymus, lung, cerebrum, stomach, ovary and heart, respectively. After injury, the CIBZ expression decreased dramatically and reached the lowest level at 8 h, but it gradually increased to the maximal level at 7 d. Caspase-3 and C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), two CIBZ-related proteins, showed similar tendency. Interestingly, p53 expression remained constant in all groups. Via flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, it was found that the cell death rate in SCI group markedly increased and reached the highest value 1 d after surgery and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi m) at 1 d was the lowest in all groups. Taken together, it is suggested that: (i) in the presence of CtBP, CIBZ gene is involved in secondary injury process and trigger the activation of apoptotic caspase-3 and bax genes independent of p53; (ii) abrupt down-regulation of CtBP at 8 h is a sign of mitochondria dysfunction and the onset of cell death; (iii) it could be used as an inhibitor or target drug of caspase-3 gene to improve spinal cord function.","zinc"

In the past decade, metalloproteinases emerged as keymodulators of neuropathic pain, with MMP-9 acting as an initiator of the neuropathic cascade. Increased MMP activity was detected in migraine patients, independent of aura, in tight association with metabolic derangements. The therapeutic implications of MMP inhibition are considered in the context of neurogenic pain regulation.","zinc"

As superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important antioxidative enzyme involved in redox regulation of oxidative stress, the present study determined whether melatonin would exert its beneficial effects by preserving the SOD reactivity following PNI. Adult rats subjected to hypoglossal nerve transection were intraperitoneally injected with melatonin at ones for 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days successively. The potential neuroprotective effects of melatonin were quantitatively demonstrated by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), mitochondrial manganese SOD (Mn-SOD), and cytosolic copper-zinc SOD (Cu/Zn-SOD) immunohistochemistry. The functional recovery of the lesioned neurons was evaluated by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry along with the electromyographic (EMG) recordings of denervation-induced fibrillation activity. The results indicate that following PNI, the nNOS immunoreactivity was significantly increased in lesioned neurons peaking at 14 days. The up-regulation of nNOS temporally coincided with the reduction of ChAT and SOD in which the Cu/Zn-SOD showed a greater diminution than Mn-SOD. However, following melatonin administration, the nNOS augmentation was successfully suppressed and the activities of Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, and ChAT were effectively preserved at all postaxotomy periods. EMG data also showed a decreased fibrillation in melatonin-treated groups, suggesting a potential effect of melatonin in promoting functional recovery. In association with its significant capacity in preserving SOD reactivity, melatonin is suggested to serve as a powerful therapeutic agent for treating PNI-relevant oxidative damage.","zinc"

Enhancing angiogenesis through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression therefore constitutes an attractive therapeutic approach. Moreover. emerging evidence suggests that VEGF-A may also exhibit neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and neuroproliferative effects. Building on this previous work, we seek to examine the potential therapeutic benefits of an engineered zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcription factor designed to activate expression of all isoforms of endogenous VEGF-A (ZFP-VEGF). Administration of ZFP-VEGF resulted in increased VEGF-A mRNA and protein levels, an attenuation of axonal degradation, a significant increase in vascularity and decreased levels of apoptosis. Furthermore, ZFP-VEGF treated animals showed significant improvements in tissue preservation and neurobehavioural outcomes. These data suggest that activation of VEGF-A via the administration of an engineered ZFP transcription factor holds promise as a therapy for SCI and potentially other forms of neurotrauma.

Oxidative stress is also implicated in the pathogenesis after cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury (SCI), but the relationship between MMP-9 activation and oxidative stress after SCI has not yet been clarified. We examined MMP-9 expression after SCI using copper/zinc - superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic (Tg) rats. Our results show that MMP-9 activity significantly increased after SCI in both SOD1 Tg rats and their wild-type (Wt) littermates, although the increase was less in the SOD1 Tg rats. This pattern of MMP-9 expression was further confirmed by immunostaining and Western blot analysis. In situ zymography showed that gelatinolytic activity increased after SCI in the Wt rats, while the increase was less in the Tg rats. Evans blue extravasation increased in both the Wt and Tg rats, but was less in the SOD1 Tg rats. Inhibitor studies showed that, with an intrathecal injection of SB-3CT ( a selective MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor), the MMP activity, Evans blue extravasation, and apoptotic cell death decreased after SCI. We conclude that increased oxidative stress after SCI leads to MMP-9 upregulation, BBB disruption, and apoptosis, and that overexpression of SOD1 in Tg rats decreases oxidative stress and further attenuates MMP-9 mediated BBB disruption.","zinc"

This is the first study to show how two commonly used anesthetics affect continuously recorded hemodynamic parameters and locomotor recovery during a 2-week period after two levels of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We hypothesized that the level of cardiovascular depression and recovery of locomotor function would be dependent upon the anesthetic used during SCI. Thirty-two adult female rats were subjected to a sham, 25-mm or 50-mm SCI at T3-4 under pentobarbital or isoflurane anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were telemetrically recorded before, during, and after SCI. Locomotor function recovered best in the 25-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. There was no significant difference in locomotor recovery between the 25-mm-injured pentobarbital-anesthetized animals and the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized animals. White matter sparing and extent of intermediolateral cell column loss appeared larger in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, but this was not significant. There were no differential effects of anesthetics on HR and MAP before SCI, but recovery from anesthesia was significantly slower in pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. At the time of SCI, MAP was acutely elevated in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, whereas MAP decreased in the isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Hypotension occurred in the pentobarbital-anesthetized groups and in the 50-mm-injured isoflurane-anesthetized group. In pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, SCI resulted in acute elevation of HR, although HR remained low. Return of HR to baseline was much slower in the pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. Severe SCI at T3 produced significant chronic tachycardia that was injury severity dependent. Although some laboratories monitor blood pressure, HR, and other physiological variables during surgery for SCI, inherently few have monitored cardiovascular function during recovery. This study shows that anesthetics affect hemodynamic parameters differently, which in turn can affect functional outcome measures. This supports the need for a careful evaluation of cardiovascular and other physiological measures in experimental models of SCI. Choice of anesthetic should be an important consideration in experimental designs and data analyses."

In initial experiments, animals were subjected to 25, 50 or 100 g cm impact injuries at T10 during pentobarbital or halothane anesthesia and their outcomes determined using somatosensory-evoked potentials, blinded neurologic evaluations for two weeks, and post-mortem analysis of spinal serotonin levels. Subsequently, halothane anesthesia was combined with either pentobarbital or nitrous oxide or given as a late treatment to pentobarbital anesthetized rats subjected to 50 g cm injuries. A series of acute studies were then performed in order to assess the hemodynamic and respiratory concomitants of halothane vs. pentobarbital, as well as the effect of mechanical ventilation and bicarbonate treatment upon halothane neuroprotection. Finally, the effect of a 50 g cm impact upon local white matter spinal cord blood flow was measured during halothane or pentobarbital anesthesia using laser-Doppler flowmetry."

Up-regulation of immune function with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 mu g i.p.) induces a recovery of normal sodium taste responses, suggesting that the sodium-deficient diet is immunosuppressive. In fact, there is a bilateral increase in the number of lingual, activated macrophages in control-fed rats receiving CT nerve section that does not occur in sodium-deficient rats after sectioning. In the current study, we hypothesized that the LPS-induced recovery of normal taste function in sodium-deficient rats is based on an increase in the activated macrophage response to denervation. Rats receiving a unilateral CT nerve section, a sodium-restricted diet, and/or an injection of LPS (100 mu g; i.p.) were overdosed with pentobarbital at day 2 postsectioning, and tongues were rapidly dissected and frozen. Cryosections were then immunohistochemically stained to determine the percentage of ED1 staining for activated macrophages or the number of alpha beta or gamma delta T cells. Activated macrophage levels were significantly increased in sodium-restricted rats that received LPS following unilateral CT nerve section, supporting our hypothesis. These novel findings suggest that LPS overcomes the immunosuppression induced by the sodium-restricted diet and also indicate that the immune system plays a role in regulating taste function after neural injury.

Spinal cord injury was produced at T-10 by the weight-drop method and confirmed by the disappearance of the somatosensory-evoked response during the subsequent 15 minutes. In all experiments, drug or vehicle treatments were randomly administered as a single intravenous bolus 15 minutes after injury. Functional outcome was blindly assessed for 2 weeks after injury using a modified Tarlov scale, and in some cases, the Rivlin-Tator angleboard test. The survival of descending raphe-spinal axons was determined by the measurement of serotonin in postmortem spinal tissues located above and below the site of injury. In separate acute experiments, the physiological and hemodynamic correlates of a 50 gm cm injury and either mianserin or vehicle injection were examined, as were the effects on serotonin content and metabolism in spinal tissues harvested 30 minutes after injury. All doses of mianserin were associated with some index of improved recovery following a 50 gm cm injury, with a 1-mg/kg dose being clearly superior. Both ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (2 mg/kg) displayed marginal therapeutic actions for 50 gm cm injuries. In acute studies, mianserin at 1 mg/kg was associated with the preservation of posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow at T-12 as well as a pronounced alteration in postmortem spinal serotonin content and metabolism, in contrast to vehicle control treatments. These data lend further support to a serotonergic hypothesis of secondary spinal cord injury and suggest the potential use of mianserin for the acute treatment of spinal cord injury."

Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring and inclined plane test indicated that cAMP treatment improved the functional recovery of SCI rats. Real time PCR and western blot analysis showed the mRNA and protein levels of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 were increased in the SCI rats than those of sham control. However, higher levels of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 were indicated after cAMP treatment. Meanwhile, more apoptotic cells were observed in the SCI rats, as evidenced by TUNEL staining and increased expression of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase12. In contrast, the expression of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase12 was decreased in SCI rats after cAMP treatment. In summary, we showed novel data that cAMP reduced cell apoptosis and functional recover after SCI mainly via activating UPR."

Identifying stable and specific oxidative biomarkers is of important significance for studying spinal cord injury-associated secondary injury. Mature erythrocytes do not contain nuclei and mitochondria and cannot be transcribed and translated. Therefore, mature erythrocytes are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and may become a valuable biomarker. In the present study, we revealed the proteome dynamics of protein expression in erythrocytes of beagle dogs in the acute and subacute phases of spinal cord injury using mass spectrometry-based approaches. We found 26 proteins that were differentially expressed in the acute (0-3 days) and subacute (7-21 days) phases of spinal cord injury. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins were involved in glutathione metabolism, lipid metabolism, and pentose phosphate and other oxidative stress pathways. Western blot assays validated the differential expression of glutathione synthetase, transaldolase, and myeloperoxidase. This result was consistent with mass spectrometry results, suggesting that erythrocytes can be used as a novel sample source of biological markers of oxidative stress in spinal cord injury. Glutathione synthetase, transaldolase, and myeloperoxidase sourced from erythrocytes are potential biomarkers of oxidative stress after spinal cord injury. This study was approved by the Experimental Animal Centre of Ningxia Medical University, China (approval No. 2017-073) on February 13, 2017."

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of miR-135a-5p in regulating the functional recovery of SCI by impacting its target genes and downstream signaling. The gene transfection assay and luciferase reporter assay confirmed the target relationship between miR-135a-5p and its target genes (specificity protein 1 [SP1] and Rho-associated kinase [ROCK]1/2). By establishing the H2O2-induced injury model, miR-135a-5p transfection was found to inhibit the apoptosis of PC12 cells by downregulating the SP1 gene, which subsequently induced downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3) and upregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. By measuring the neurite lengths of PC12 cells, miR-135a-5p transfection was found to promote axon outgrowth by downregulating the ROCK1/2 gene, which subsequently caused upregulation of phosphate protein kinase B (AKT) and phosphate glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta). Use of the rat SCI models showed that miR-135a-5p could increase the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores, indicating neurological function recovery. In conclusion, the miR-135a-5p-SP1-Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 and miR-135a-5p-ROCK-AKT/GSK3 beta axes are involved in functional recovery of SCI by regulating neural apoptosis and axon regeneration, respectively, and thus can be promising effective therapeutic strategies in SCI."

This failure is multi-factorial and caused in part by disruption of the axonal cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton, in particular microtubules (MT), plays a critical role in axonal transport and axon growth during development. In this regard, members of the kinesin superfamily of proteins (KIFs) regulate the extension of primary axons toward their targets and control the growth of collateral branches. KIF2A negatively regulates axon growth through MT depolymerization. Using three different injury models to induce SCI in adult rats, we examined the temporal and cellular expression of KIF2A in the injured spinal cord. We observed a progressive increase of KIF2A expression with maximal levels at 10 days to 8 weeks post-injury as determined by Western blot analysis. KIF2A immunoreactivity was present in axons, spinal neurons and mature oligodendrocytes adjacent to the injury site. Results from the present study suggest that KIF2A at the injured axonal tips may contribute to neurite outgrowth inhibition after injury, and that its increased expression in inhibitory spinal neurons adjacent to the injury site might contribute to an intrinsic wiring-control mechanism associated with neuropathic pain. Further studies will determine whether KIF2A may be a potential target for the development of regeneration-promoting or pain-preventing therapies."

Although the elevation of cAMP levels was reported to promote the functional recovery in spinal cord injury, its role in neurogenesis or functional recovery after hippocampal injury is unknown. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of dBcAMP on learning, memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in the excitotoxically lesioned hippocampus. An excitotoxic lesion was induced in the hippocampi of 4-month-old male BALB/c mice by injecting 0.25 mu g/mu l into the lateral ventricles of both sides. The lesioned mice (L) were divided into L+dBcAMP and L+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) groups. Sham surgery (S) was done by the injection of 1 mu l of sterile saline into the lateral ventricles. The sham surgery mice were divided into S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups. Mice in the L+dBcAMP and S+dBcAMP groups were treated with dBcAMP for 1 week (i.p., 50 mg/kg), whereas mice in the L+PBS and S+PBS groups were treated with PBS. The mice in all groups were subjected to water maze and passive avoidance tests at the end of the 4th week. Cresyl violet staining and NeuN and doublecortin immunostaining were done to analyze the morphology and neurogenesis. The water maze learning sessions did not show a significant difference in escape latency between the groups, suggesting an unimpaired learning ability of mice in all groups. The L+dBcAMP mice had significantly short entry latency and higher target quadrant time/distance traveled compared to the L+PBS group, suggesting better memory retention. The L+dBcAMP group had a significantly improved memory retention compared to the L+PBS mice during the passive avoidance test. Morphological studies showed significantly greater adult neurons and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice in the L+dBcAMP group compared to those in the L+PBS group. There was no significant difference between the S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups in the water maze/passive avoidance tests and the number of neurons. In conclusion, dBcAMP protects the hippocampal neuron from degeneration and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, learning, and memory."

To study the effects of rhodioloside and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on spinal cord injury, a rat model of spinal cord injury was established using the Infinite Horizons method. After establishing the model, the rats were randomly divided into five groups. Rats in the control group were intragastrically injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (5 mu L). PBS was injected at 6 equidistant points around 5 mm from the injury site and at a depth of 5 mm. Rats in the rhodioloside group were intragastrically injected with rhodioloside (5 g/kg) and intramuscularly injected with PBS. Rats in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) group were intramuscularly injected with PBS and intramuscularly with MSCs (8 x 10(6)/mL in a 50-mu L cell suspension). Rats in the Ad-HIF-MSC group were intragastrically injected with PBS and intramuscularly injected with HIF-1 adenovirus-infected MSCs. Rats in the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group were intramuscularly injected with MSCs infected with the HIF-1 adenovirus and intragastrically injected with rhodioloside. One week after treatment, exercise recovery was evaluated with a modified combined behavioral score scale. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Pischingert's methylene blue staining were used to detect any histological or pathological changes in spinal cord tissue. Levels of adenovirus IX and Sry mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and used to determine the number of adenovirus and mesenchymal stem cells that were transfected into the spinal cord. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to detect HIF-1 protein levels in the spinal cord. The results showed that: (1) compared with the other groups, the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group exhibited the highest combined behavioral score (P < 0.05), the most recovered tissue, and the greatest number of neurons, as indicated by Pischingert's methylene blue staining. (2) Compared with the PBS group, HIF-1 protein expression was greater in the rhodioloside group (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with the Ad-HIF-MSC group, Sry mRNA levels were higher in the rhodioloside + Ad-HIF-MSC group (P < 0.05). These results confirm that rhodioloside combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can promote the recovery of spinal cord injury and activate the HIF-1 pathway to promote the survival of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and repair damaged neurons within spinal cord tissue.

Existing evidence suggests the potential therapy of transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) either alone or in combination with neurotrophic factors or other cell types in optic nerve injury (ONI). However, clinical use of autologous OEC in the acute stages of ONI is not possible. On the other hand, acute application of heterologous transplantation may bring the issue of immune rejection. The olfactory mucosa (OM) with OEC in the lamina propria layer is located in the upper region of the nasal cavity and is easy to dissect under nasal endoscopy, which makes it a candidate as autograft material in acute stages of ONI. To investigate the potential of the OM on the protection of injured neurons and on the promotion of axonal regeneration, we developed a transplantation of syngenic OM in rats with ONI model. Methods. After the right optic nerve was crushed in Lewis rats, pieces of syngenic whole-layer OM were transplanted into the lesion. Rats undergoing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injection were used as negative controls (NC). The authors evaluated the regeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and axons for 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after transplantation. Obtained retinas and optic nerves were analyzed histologically. Results. Transplantations of OM significantly promoted the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and axonal growth of RGCs compared with PBS alone. Moreover, OM group was associated with higher expression of GAP-43 in comparison with the PBS group. In addition to the potential effects on RGCs, transplantations of OM significantly decreased the expression of GFAP in the retinas, suggesting inhibiting astrocyte activation. Conclusions. Transplantation of whole-layer OM in rats contributes to the neuronal survival and axon regeneration after ONI."

Lack of an established animal model to test drug treatments hinders the introduction of new pharmacological agents. Avulsion injury of cervical ventral roots can be replicated in rats, resulting in a progressive loss of the motoneurons and increase in neurotoxic expression of microglia. This is a report on the effect of prompt nerve implantation and minocycline treatment on the suppression of microglia activation and survival of motoneurons. 20 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study, which was approved by the Animal Ethical Committee, USM (approval number/2011/(73)(346)). The animals underwent surgical avulsion of the C6 nerve root, followed by reimplantation with peripheral nerve graft and treatment with intraperitoneal minocycline. At 6 weeks postoperatively, immunohistochemistry using primary antibody Iba1 (microglia) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPh) with neutral-red staining (motoneuron) under flourescence microscopy was performed at the C6 spinal cord segment and then quantified. This study showed significant reduction of microglia expression in the study group; mean ranks of control and study group were 15.2 and 11.6, respectively; U= 9.5, Z= 3.02, p< 0.05.

This may be due to the effect of the surgery; the surgery has the potential to cause additional trauma to the cord parenchyma, leading to further motoneuron loss and an increase in scarring around the avulsed region, thus impeding regeneration of the motoneuron."

Inhibitory signalling from these domains causes a collapse of the neuronal growth cone via individual receptor complexes, centred around sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) for Nogo-A-Delta 20 and Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) for Nogo-66. Whereas the helical conformation of Nogo-66 has been studied extensively, only little structural information is available for the Nogo-A-Delta 20 region. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess potential residual structural propensities of the intrinsically disordered Nogo-A-Delta 20. Using triple resonance experiments, we were able to assign 94% of the non-proline backbone residues. While secondary structure analysis and relaxation measurements highlighted the intrinsically disordered character of Nogo-A-Delta 20, three stretches comprising residues (561)EAI-QESL(567), (639)EAMNVALKALGT(650), and (693)SNYSEIAK(700) formtransient a-helical structures. Interestingly, (561)EAIQESL(567) is situated directly adjacent to one of the most conserved regions of Nogo-A-Delta 20 that contains a binding motif for beta 1-integrin. Likewise, 639EAMNVALKALGT650 partially overlaps with the epitope recognized by 11C7, a Nogo-A-neutralizing antibody that promotes functional recovery from spinal cord injury. Diffusion measurements by pulse-field gradient NMR spectroscopy suggest concentration-and oxidation state-dependent dimerisation of Nogo-A-Delta 20. Surprisingly, NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data could not validate previously shown binding of extracellular loops of S1PR2 to Nogo-A-Delta 20."

Methods: Nociceptive mechanical sensitivity of the facial skin was assessed following IANX (n = 10) or sham operation (n = 7). GDNF-positive cells were identified and the amount of GDNF measured in the injured region of IANX rats (n = 10) and in sham rats (n = 10). The number of trigeminal ganglion neurons with regenerated axons and the nociceptive mechanical sensitivity after continuous GDNF administration at the injury site were also assessed in IANX ( n = 28) and sham (n = 12) rats. The effect of GDNF neutralization on nociceptive mechanical sensitivity at the injury site was evaluated using a neutralizing antibody (GFR alpha 1 Nab) in four groups: IANX + phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (n = 6); sham (n = 12); IANX + GDNF = 12); and IANX + GDNF + GFR alpha 1 Nab (n = 12). Statistical analyses included one-way and two-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests or unpaired t tests. The threshold for statistical significance was set at P < .05. Results: Nociceptive mechanical sensitivity was lost over the 5 days following IANX and was recovered by day 13. GDNF was expressed in infiltrating inflammatory cells and had enhanced expression. GDNF administration enhanced axonal regeneration and recovery of nociceptive mechanical sensitivity. GDNF neutralization inhibited the recovery of nociceptive mechanical sensitivity after IANX. Conclusion: GDNF signaling at the injury site facilitates the functional recovery of mechanical nociception following IANX and is an attractive therapeutic target for the functional disturbance of pain sensation."

Female rats with SCI induced by 1-min clip compression were administered vehicle or 1.5 mg/kg of FTY720 24 h after the injury. Using the mechanical nociceptive threshold test, we monitored neuropathic pain and performed histological analysis of the pain pathway, including the mu opioid receptor (MOR), hydroxytryptamine transporter (HTT), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Motor score, SCI lesion volume, residual motor axons, inflammatory response, glial scar, and microvascular endothelial dysfunction were also compared between the two groups. FTY720 treatment resulted in significant attenuation of post-traumatic neuropathic pain. It also decreased systemic and local inflammation, thereby reducing the damaged areas and astrogliosis and resulting in motor functional recovery. Whereas there was no difference in the CGRP expression between the two groups, FTY720 significantly preserved the MOR in both the caudal and rostral areas of the spinal dorsal horn. Whereas HTT was preserved in the FTY720 group, it was significantly increased in the rostral side and decreased in the caudal side of the injury in the vehicle group. These results suggest that FTY720 ameliorates post-traumatic allodynia through regulation of neuroinflammation, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and inhibition of glial scar formation, thereby preserving the connectivity of the descending inhibitory pathway and reducing neuropathic pain."

Conditions that allow axon growth by axotomized and cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on CNS myelin include immaturity (the first few postnatal days), high levels of cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP), and conditioning with a peripheral nerve lesion before explant.

In this Perspective, we review evidence from these experiments and discuss the merits of comparing multiple regenerative paradigms to identify a core transcriptional program for CNS axon regeneration."

Ephrin-B3 has been shown to reduce the death of endogenous NSPC in the subventricular zone of the mouse brain without inducing uncontrolled proliferation. Due to similarities in the environment of the brain and spinal cord, we hypothesized that ephrin-B3 might reduce the death of both transplanted and endogenous spinal cord-derived NSPC. Both normal and injured (26 g clip compression) spinal cords were examined. Ephrin-B3-Fc was tested, and Fc fragments and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as controls. We found that EphA4 receptors were expressed by spinal cord-derived NSPC and expressed in the normal and injured rat spinal cord (higher expression in the latter). In vitro, ephrin-B3-Fc did not significantly reduce the survival of NSPC except at 1 mu g/mL (P < 0.05), but Fc fragments alone reduced NSPC survival at all doses in a dose-dependent fashion. In vivo, intrathecal infusion of ephrin-B3-Fc increased the proliferation of endogenous ependymal cells and the proportion of proliferating cells that expressed the glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytic marker in the injured spinal cord compared with the infusion of PBS (P < 0.05). However, in the injured spinal cord, the infusion of either ephrin-B3-Fc or Fc fragments alone caused a 20-fold reduction in the survival of transplanted NSPC (P < 0.001). Thus, after SCI, ephrin-B3-Fc and Fc fragments are toxic to transplanted NSPC."

Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale and grid walk tests were then utilized to estimate neurological rehabilitation. Additionally, the following assays were performed: Immunofluorescence localization of BMSCs to the site of SCI; the transwcll migration assay to detect in vitro cellular migration; the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay to determine the apoptotic index of the lesion; and western blotting analysis to evaluate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at the site of SCI. The BBB scores of the BMSC + EPO treated group were significantly increased compared with the BMSC treatment group (P<0.05). For example, BMSC + EPO treated rats had a significantly decreased number of hind limb slips compared with the BMSC treatment group (P<0.05). Furthermore, EPO significantly increased the migration capacity of BMSCs compared with the control group (P<0.001l). In addition, the apoptotic index of the BMSC + EPO group was significantly decreased compared with the BMSC group (P<0.05). Green fluorescent protein-labeled BMSCs were detected at the site of SCI in the BMSC and BMSCs + EPO groups, with the signal being notably stronger in the latter. Moreover, the expression of VEGF and BDNF in the BMSCs + EPO group was significantly increased compared with the BMSC group (P<0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that EPO can facilitate the recruitment of BNISCs to sites of SCI, increase expression of BDNF and VEGF, and accelerate recovery of neurological function following SCI."

It is associated with a variety of injurious conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for spinal cord injury (SCI). Sivelestat sodium (SIV), a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor initially used to treat acute lung injury, has been known to protect against compression-induced and ischemic SCI. However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25 mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) signaling in the spinal cord. The behavioral tests showed that SIV promoted functional recovery after traumatic SCI as reflected in the sustained increase in the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores throughout the observation period. In conclusion, our results reveal GAPDH/Siah1 as a novel signaling pathway during the progression of SCI, which can be blocked by SIV. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Therefore, providing spinal tissue with an alternative energy substrate during ischemia may be neuroprotective after SCI. To assess this, rats received a mild contusive SCI (120kdyn, Infinite Horizons impactor) at thoracic level 9 (T9), which causes loss of approximate to 80% of the ascending sensory dorsal column axonal projections to the gracile nucleus. Immediately afterwards, the energy substrate acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC; 1mg/day) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was infused intrathecally (sub-arachnoid) for 6 days via an L5/6 catheter attached to a subcutaneous Alzet pump. ALC treatment improved overground locomotor function (Basso-Beattie-Breshnahan [BBB] score 18 vs. 13) at 6 days, total spared epicenter (71% vs. 57%) and penumbra white matter (90% vs. 85%), ventral penumbra microvessels (108% vs. 79%), and penumbra motor neurons (42% vs. 15%) at 15 days post-SCI, compared with PBS treatment. However, the ascending sensory projections (anterogradely traced with cholera toxin B from the sciatic nerves) and dorsal column white matter and perfused blood vessels were not protected. Furthermore, grid walking, a task we have shown to be dependent on dorsal column function, was not improved.

In process of enlargement of spinal cavity after SCI, the number of pericytes increased and outnumbered astrocytes. However, the mechanism of proliferation of pericytes remains unclear. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP) has been reported to play important roles in the formation of glia scar, but previous studies had paid more attention to the astrocytes. The present study aimed to observe the effects of SIP and SIP receptors (S1PRs) on proliferation of pericytes and investigate the underlying mechanism. By double immunostaining, we found that the number of PDGFR beta-positive pericytes was gradually increased and sealed the cavity, which surrounded by reactive astrocytes. Moreover, the subtype of S1PR3 was found to be induced by SCI and mainly expressed on pericytes. Further, by use of CAY10444, an inhibitor of S1PR3, we showed that S1P/S1PR3 mediated the proliferation of pericytes through Ras/pERK pathway. Moreover, CAY10444 was found to have the effects of enhancing neuronal survival, alleviating glial scar formation, and improving locomotion recovery after SCI.

Our earlier investigations indicated that intrathecal administration of a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) antagonist, cytidine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide 2088 (CpG ODN 2088), to mice sustaining a severe, mid-thoracic contusion injury diminished neuropathic pain but did not alter locomotor deficits. These changes were paralleled by a decrease in the pro-inflammatory response at the injury epicenter. Using the same SCI paradigm and treatment regimen, the current studies investigated the effects of the TLR9 antagonist on bladder function. We report that the TLR9 antagonist decreases SCI-elicited urinary retention and ameliorates bladder morphopathology without affecting kidney function. A significant improvement in white matter sparing was also observed, most likely due to alterations in the inflammatory milieu. These findings indicate that the TLR9 antagonist has beneficial effects not only in reducing sensory deficits, but also on bladder dysfunction and tissue preservation. Thus, modulation of innate immune receptor signaling in the spinal cord can impact the effects of SCI."

Since macrophages are major inflammatory contributors to the acute spinal cord injury, and are the major phagocytic cells, we hypothesized that transplanting Schwann cells after macrophage depletion will improve cell survival and integration with host tissue after SCI. To test this hypothesis, rat models of contusive SCI at thoracic level 8 were randomly subjected to macrophage depletion or not. In rat subjected to macrophage depletion, liposomes filled with clodronate were intraperitoneally injected at 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18 days post injury. Rats not subjected to macrophage depletion were intraperitoneally injected with liposomes filled with phosphate buffered saline. Schwann cells were transplanted 1 week post injury in all rats. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected at thoracic level 5 to evalute axon regeneration. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor test, Gridwalk test, and sensory test using von Frey filaments were performed to assess functional recovery. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament, and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and also to visulize BDA-labelled axons. The GFP labeled Schwann cell and cyst and lesion volumes were quantified using stained slides. The numbers of BDA-positive axons were also quantified. At 8 weeks after Schwann cell transplantation, there was a significant reduction in cyst and lesion volumes in the combined treatment group compared to Schwann cell transplantation alone. These changes were not associated, however, with improved Schwann cell survival, axon growth, or locomotor recovery. Although combining Schwann cell transplantation with macrophage depletion does improve histopathology of the injury site, the effect on axon growth and behavioral recovery appears no better than what can be achieved with Schwann cell transplants alone."

In this study, we analyzed the combination of different strategies as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury. Immunization with neural derived peptides (INDP), inhibition of glial scar formation (dipyridyl: DPY), as well as the use of biocompatible matrix (fibrin glue: FG) impregnated with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were combined and then its beneficial effects were evaluated in the induction of neuroprotection and neuroregeneration after acute SCI. Sprague-Dawley female rats were subjected to a moderate spinal cord injury and then randomly allocated into five groups: 1) phosphate buffered saline; 2) DPY; 3) INDP + DPY; 4) DPY+ FG; 5) INDP + DPY + FG + MSCs. In all rats, intervention was performed 72 hours after spinal cord injury. Locomotor and sensibility recovery was assessed in all rats. At 60 days after treatment, histological examinations of the spinal cord (hematoxylin-eosin and Biel-schowsky staining) were performed. Our results showed that the combination therapy (DPY+ INDP + FG + MSCs) was the best strategy to promote motor and sensibility recovery. In addition, significant increases in tissue preservation and axonal density were observed in the combination therapy group.

This study uses peripheral nerve grafts (PNGs) as scaffolds for axonal growth while delivering neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) via calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings on surgical sutures. CaP coating was grown on sutures, and NT-3 binding and release were characterized in vitro. Then, the NT-3-loaded sutures were tested in a complete SCI model. Rats were analyzed for functional improvement and axonal growth into the grafts. The CaP-coated sutures exhibited a burst release of NT-3, followed by a sustained release for at least 20 days. Functionally, the rats with PNGs1NT-3-loaded sutures and the rats treated with PNGs scored significantly higher than controls on day 56 postoperatively. However, functional scores in rats treated with PNGs1NT-3-loaded suture were not significantly different from those of rats treated with PNGs alone. Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) labeling rostral to the graft was not observed in any controls, but CTB labeling rostral to the graft was observed in almost all rats that had had a PNG. Neurofilament labeling on transverse sections of the graft revealed that the rats treated with the NT-3-loaded sutures had significantly more axons per graft than rats treated with an NT-3 injection and rats without NT-3. These data demonstrate that PNGs serve as scaffolds for axonal growth after SCI and that CaP-coated sutures can efficiently release NT-3 to increase axonal regeneration.

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were selected to establish the ASCI model, and the expressions of miR-92b-3p and phosphate and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) were quantified at different time points. The interaction between miR-92b-3p and PTEN was further detected in the PC12 cell line and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Neurite growth proteins (GAP43 and NF-200) were assessed by western blotting after miR-92b-3p mimics treatment. The PTEN/AKT pathway-related proteins and their roles in miR-92b-3p regulation were also identified using western blotting and immunofluorescence in vitro through LY294002, an AKT inhibitor. The effect of miR-92b-3p was further determined in vivo according to the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) Scale and GAP43 and NF-200 expressions. miR-92b-3p was downregulated after ASCI, while PTEN showed a simultaneous opposing trend. Overexpression of miR-92b-3p downregulated PTEN expression and promoted phosphorylation of AKT, as well as the expression of GAP43 and NF-200 in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-92b-3p exerted its effect by targeting PTEN's 3'-untranslated regions and that this effect could be counteracted by AKT phosphorylation blocker LY294002 through western blotting and immunofluorescence. Moreover, miR-92b-3p could also improve the BBB scale as well asGAP43 and NF-200 expression levels in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-92b-3p promotes neurite growth and functional recovery through the PTEN/AKT pathway in ASCI."

The combination of a scaffold with cells has been developed with a tendency for achieving greater survival and integration with the host tissue. We investigated the effect of Matrigel combined with neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro and in vivo. We compared the effect of different types of scaffold on the survival and differentiation of brain-derived NSCs in an in vitro culture. Subsequently, NSCs were transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice to detect graft survival and differentiation in vivo. Finally, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Matrigel alone, or Matrigel seeded with NSCs was injected into 48 subacute, clinically relevant rat models of SCI (16 rats per group). Matrigel supported cell survival and differentiation efficiently in vitro and in vivo. SCI rats transplanted with NSCs in Matrigel showed improved behavioral recovery and neuronal and reactive astrocyte marker expression levels compared to PBS- or Matrigel-transplanted rats. Functional repair and neuronal and reactive astrocyte marker expression was slightly improved in the Matrigel-alone group relative to the PBS group, but not statistically significantly. These data suggest that Matrigel is a promising scaffold material for cell transplantation to the injured spinal cord."

It is now appreciated that the heterogeneity of functions adopted by these cells dictates neuropathophysiology. Research efforts to characterize the range of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes and functions adopted by microglia and macrophages are fueled by the potential for inflammatory cells to both exacerbate neurodegeneration and promote repair/disease resolution. The stimulation-based, M1/M2 classification system has emerged over the last decade as a common language to discuss macrophage and microglia heterogeneity across different fields. However, discontinuities between phenotypic markers and function create potential hurdles for the utility of the M1/M2 system in the development of effective immunomodulatory therapeutics for neuroinflammation. A framework to approach macrophage and microglia heterogeneity from a function-based phenotypic approach comes from rapidly emerging evidence that metabolic processes regulate immune cell activation. This concept of immunometabolism, however, is only beginning to unfold in the study of neurodegeneration and has yet to receive much focus in the context of neurotrauma. In this review, we first discuss the current views of macrophage and microglia heterogeneity and limitations of the M1/M2 classification system for neuropathological studies. We then review and discuss the current literature supporting metabolism as a regulator of microglia function in vitro. Lastly, we evaluate the evidence that metabolism regulates microglia and macrophage phenotype in vivo in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI)."

Rats with sham-operation or transection at the thoracic level (T-7-T-8) received vehicle or 5 mg/kg of the GC dexamethasone (DEX) at 5 min post-lesion and were sacrificed 2 or 4 h after surgery. Another group of SO rats received vehicle or intensive DEX treatment (5 min, 6 h, 18 h and 46 h post-lesion) and were sacrificed 48 h after surgery. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons or Fos immunoreactive nuclei was studied by computer-assisted image analysis in superficial dorsal horn (Laminae I-III) and central canal area (Lamina X) below the lesion. While constitutive Fos immunoreactive nuclei were sparse in controls, SO increased Fos expression at 2 and 4 h after injury. DEX treatment significantly enhanced the number of Fos positive nuclei in Laminae I-III by 4 It after transection, although the response was not maintained by intensive steroid treatment when tested at 48 li after SCI. NADPH-d positive neurons in Laminae I-III increased at 2 and 4 h after SO while a delayed increased was found in central canal area (Lamina X). DEX treatment decreased NADPH-d positive neurons to sham-operated levels at all time points examined. Thus, while GC stimulation of Fos suggests activation of neurons involved in sympathetic outflow and/or pain, down-regulation of NADPH-d indicates attenuation of nociceptive outflow, considering the role of enzyme-derived nitric oxide in pain-related mechanisms.

A multivariate analysis encompassing all the parameters indicated that OEG-transplanted rats displayed skeletal muscle phenotypes intermediate between non-transplanted and sham-operated controls, but different from both. A high correlation was observed between behaviourally tested sensory-motor functional capacity and expression level of slow- and fast-twitch hind limb skeletal muscle phenotypic markers, particularly the histochemical glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (-0.843, P < 0.0001) and the fraction of variant 2s of the slow regulatory myosin light chain isoform (0.848, P < 0.0001) in SOL. Despite the mean overall effect of OEG transplants in patterning skeletal muscle protein expression towards normal, in 6 out of 9 animals they appeared insufficient to overcome fibre type switching and to support a consistent and generalized long-term maintenance of normal skeletal muscle characteristics. The interplay of OEG and exercise-mediated neurotrophic actions is a plausible mechanism underlying OEG transplantation effects on paralysed skeletal muscle."

The SCI was made using a vascular clip at the T9 level. Cells were transplanted into the lesion site 3days after injury. A functional test was performed over 4weeks employing a BBB score. Rats were killed for histological analysis at 3days, 1week and 4weeks after injury. The transplantation of hMSCs and hcMSCs significantly reduced lesion size and the fluid-filled cavity at 4weeks in comparison with the control group injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (p<0.01). Transplantation of hcMSCs showed more axons reserved than that of hMSCs in the lesion epicentre filled with non-neuronal tissues. In addition, hMSCs and hcMSCs clearly reduced the inflammatory reaction and intraparenchymal hemorrhaging, compared with the PBS group. Interestingly, hcMSCs largely decreased Col IV expression, one of the markers of fibrotic scars. hcMSCs yielded therapeutic effects more than equal to those of hMSCs on the SCI. Both hMSCs and hcMSCs created an increase in axon regeneration and reduced scar formation around the SCI lesion. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The in vitro study showed that FTY720 can reduce astrocyte migration and proliferation activated by SIP. FTY720 can prolong internalization of S1P1 and exert antagonistic effects on S1P1. In vivo study of SCI animal models demonstrated that local delivery of FTY720 with polycaprolactone (PCL) membrane significantly decreased S1P1 expression and glial scarring compared with the control group. Furthermore, FTY720-treated groups exhibited less cavitation volume and neuron loss, which significantly improved recovery of motor function.

In this study, we report the novel use of a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid scaffold to provide contact guidance for regrowth of axons in vivo. The scaffold comprises 3D aligned sparsely distributed poly(e-caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) nanofibers that are supported and dispersed within a collagen hydrogel. Neurotrophin-3 was incorporated into the scaffold as an additional biochemical signal. To evaluate the efficacy of the scaffold in supporting nerve regeneration after SCIs, the construct was implanted into an incision injury, which was created at level C5 in the rat spinal cord. After 3 months of implantation, scaffolds with NT-3 incorporation showed the highest average neurite length (391.9 +/- 12.9 mu m, p <= 0.001) as compared to all the other experimental groups. In addition, these regenerated axons formed along the direction of the aligned nanofibers, regardless of their orientation. Moreover, the presence of the hybrid scaffolds did not affect tissue scarring and inflammatory reaction. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that our scaffold design can serve as a potential platform to support axonal regeneration following SCIs."

To understand genetic determinants of mammalian CNS axon regeneration, we completed an unbiased RNAi gene-silencing screen across most phosphatases in the genome. We identified one known and 17 previously unknown phosphatase suppressors of injury-induced CNS axon growth. Silencing Inpp5f (Sac2) leads to robust enhancement of axon regeneration and growth cone reformation. Results from cultured Inpp5f(-/-) neurons confirm lentiviral shRNA results from the screen. Consistent with the nonoverlapping substrate specificity between Inpp5f and PTEN, rapamycin does not block enhanced regeneration in Inpp5f(-/-) neurons, implicating mechanisms independent of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Inpp5f(-/-) mice develop normally, but show enhanced anatomical and functional recovery after mid-thoracic dorsal hemisection injury. More serotonergic axons sprout and/or regenerate caudal to the lesion level, and greater numbers of corticospinal tract axons sprout rostral to the lesion. Functionally, Inpp5f-null mice exhibit enhanced recovery of motor functions in both open-field and rotarod tests. This study demonstrates the potential of an unbiased high-throughput functional screen to identify endogenous suppressors of CNS axon growth after injury, and reveals Inpp5f (Sac2) as a novel suppressor of CNS axon repair after spinal cord injury."

Therefore, a reliable prediction of the improvement in the acute phase could benefit patients. Physicians are unanimous in insisting that at the initial damage of the spinal cord (SC), the patient should be carefully evaluated in order to help selecting an appropriate neuroprotective treatment. However, currently, neurologic impairment after SCI is measured and classified by functional examination. The identification of prognostic biomarkers of SCI would help to designate SC injured patients and correlate to diagnosis and correct treatment. Some proteins have already been identified as good potential biomarkers of central nervous system injury, both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum. However, the problem for using them as biomarkers is the way they should be collected, as acquiring CSF through a lumbar puncture is significantly invasive. Remarkably, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as interesting biomarker candidates because of their stability in biological fluids and their tissue specificity. Several miRNAs have been identified to have their expressions altered in SCI in many animal models, making them promising candidates as biomarkers after SCI. Moreover, there are yet no effective therapies for SCI. It is already known that altered lysophospholipids (LPs) signaling are involved in the biology of disorders, such as inflammation. Reports have demonstrated that LPs when locally distributed can regulate SCI repair and key secondary injury processes such as apoptosis and inflammation, and so could become in the future new therapeutic approaches for treating SCI."

Wild-type mice were generated with contusive SCI at the T10 level, and NS/PCs were derived from fetal transgenic mice. These NS/PCs ubiquitously expressed ffLuc-cp156 protein (Venus and luciferase fusion protein) and so could be detected by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 9 days postinjury. NS/PCs (low: 250,000 cells per mouse; high. 1 million cells per mouse) were grafted into the spinal cord at the lesion epicenter (E) or at rostral and caudal (RC) sites. Phosphate-buffered saline was injected into E as a control. Motor functional recovery was better in each of the transplantation groups (E-Low, E-High, RC-Low, and RC-High) than in the control group. The photon counts of the grafted NS/PCs were similar in each of the four transplantation groups, suggesting that the survival of NS/PCs was fairly uniform when more than a certain threshold number of cells were transplanted. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that brain-derived neurotropic factor expression was higher in the RC segment than in the E segment, and this may underlie why NS/PCs more readily differentiated into neurons than into astrocytes in the RC group. The location of the transplantation site did not affect the area of spared fibers, angiogenesis, or the expression of any other mediators. These findings indicated that the microenvironments of the E and RC sites are able to support NS/PCs transplanted during the subacute phase of SCI similarly. Optimally, a certain threshold number of NS/PCs should be grafted into the E segment to avoid damaging sites adjacent to the lesion during the injection procedure."

To test this hypothesis, we selected six genes and studied their temporal and spatial patterns of expression at 1 h, 1, 3 and 7 days after a standardized spinal cord contusion produced by a weight drop device (10 g x 25 mm at T8). Real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan probes was employed to quantify mRNA for proteolipid protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, nestin, and the GluR2 and NR1 subunits of glutamate receptors. We found widely different temporal and spatial patterns of altered gene expression after SCI, including instances of opposing up- and down-regulation at different locations in tissue immediately adjacent to the injury site. We conclude that greater use of the reliable and extremely sensitive technique of quantitative real-time PCR for regional tissue analysis is important for understanding the altered gene expression that occurs after CNS trauma."

The antigen specificity of the neuroprotective T cells has not been investigated after FNAx. Here, we compared the neuroprotective capacity of autoimmune and non-autoimmune lymphocytes after FNAx. Prior to axotomy, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) or ovalbumin (a non-self antigen) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). FNAx mice receiving injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) only (unimmunized) or PBS/CFA emulsions served as controls. At 4 weeks after axotomy, bilateral facial motor neuron counts were obtained throughout the facial motor nucleus using unbiased stereology (optical fractionator). The data show that neuroantigen immunizations and 'generic' lymphocyte activation (e.g. PBS/CFA or ovalbumin/CFA immunizations) exacerbated neuron loss above that caused by FNAx alone. We also found that nerve injury potentiated the effector potential of autoimmune lymphocytes. Indeed, prominent forelimb and hindlimb motor deficits were accompanied by disseminated neuroinflammation and demyelination in FNAx mice receiving subencephalitogenic immunization with MOG. FNAx or neuroantigen (MOG or myelin basic protein) immunization alone did not cause these pathological changes. Thus, irrespective of the antigens used to trigger an immune response, neuropathology was enhanced when the immune system was primed in parallel with nerve injury. These data have important implications for therapeutic vaccination in clinical neurotrauma and neurodegeneration."

The open-field Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor scale revealed that the locomotor function of the experimental group was better than in the control group from 8 to 12 weeks after implantation, and urodynamic analysis revealed additional improvements in the experimental group in some parameters. Twelve weeks after implantation, some axon growth from the proximal and distal stumps to the scaffold was observed in the experimental group but not in the control group. Macrophages surrounded the injured thoracic spinal cord at 1 and 4 weeks after implantation; however, 6 h after implantation, the pro-inflammatory cytokines did not differ between the control and experimental groups. Anterograde corticospinal tract (CST) tracing with biotinylated dextran amine showed that, in the experimental group, some CST outgrowths could reach the lumbar enlargement. By 12 weeks, the mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the bladder had increased more in the experimental group than in the controls. We conclude that PGFs can have a beneficial effect on functional recovery following complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord in rats. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cell-based gene therapy is becoming a major focus for the treatment of SCI. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a promising stem cell type useful for repairing SCI. However, the effects of BMSCs transplants are likely limited because of low transplant survival after SCI. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a multifunctional growth factor which can facilitate neuronal and BMSCs survival, promote axonal growth, prevent activation of the astrocyte lineage, and enhance the delivery of neurotrophic factors in BMSCs. However, treatment of SCI with Shh alone also has limited effects on recovery, because the protein is cleared quickly. In this study, we investigated the use of BMSCs overexpressing the Shh transgene (Shh-BMSCs) in the treatment of rats with SCI, which could stably secrete Shh and thereby enhance the effects of BMSCs, in an attempt to combine the advantages of Shh and BMSCs and so to promote functional recovery. After Shh-BMSCs treatment of SCI via the subarachnoid, we detected significantly greater damage recovery compared with that seen in rats treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and BMSCs. Use of Shh-BMSCs increased the expression and secretion of Shh, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), improved the behavioral function, enhanced the BMSCs survival, promoted the expression level of neurofilament 200 (NF200), and reduced the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Thus, our results indicated that Shh-BMSCs enhanced recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats and could be a potential valuable therapeutic intervention for SCI in humans.

Methods: Middle cerebral artery occlusion was used to establish cerebral ischemia. Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: iPSC treatment, ESC treatment, and the control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection. After neurologic function tests and baseline F-18-FDG small-animal PET had been performed, 1.0 x 106 suspended iPSCs or ESCs were injected stereotactically into the left lateral ventricle. The treatment response was evaluated weekly by F-18-FDG PET scans and neurologic function tests. Histologic analyses and autoradiographic imaging were performed 4 wk after stem cell transplantation. Results: Compared with the PBS injection group, higher F-18-FDG accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction was observed in both the iPSC and the ESC treatment groups during the 4-wk period (P < 0.05). F-18-FDG accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction increased steadily over time in the iPSC treatment group. At 1 and 2 wk after stem cell transplantation, significant recovery of glucose metabolism was found in the ESC treatment group (P < 0.05) and then decreased gradually. The neurologic score in both stem cell-treated groups was significantly lower than that in the PBS group, indicating functional improvement. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that transplanted stem cells survived and migrated close to the ischemic region, and most of the stem cells expressed protein markers for cells of interest. Conclusion: F-18-FDG small-animal PET demonstrated metabolic recovery after iPSC and ESC transplantation in the rat model of cerebral ischemia. iPSCs could be considered a potentially better therapeutic approach than ESCs and are worthy of further translational investigation."

We repeated two published studies reporting the beneficial effects of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2'-4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) or Brilliant blue G (BBG) treatment after SCI (Wang et al., 2004 and Peng et al., 2009). Mild thoracic SCI was first produced in Experiment 1 by means of the MASCIS impactor at T10 (height 6.25 mm, weight 10 g) followed by intraspinal administration of a P2X7 antagonist (2 mu l/10 mM) after injury. Treatment with PPADS or another highly selective P2X7R antagonist Brilliant Blue G (BBG) (2 mu l/02 mM) did not improve locomotive (BBB rating scale) over a 7 week period compared to vehicle treated rats. Also, secondary histopathological changes in terms of overall lesion and cavity volume were not significantly different between the PPADS, BBG, and vehicle treated animals. In the second experiment, the systemic administration of BBG (10 or 50 mg/kg, iv) 15 min, 24 and 72 h after moderate (12.5 mm) SCI failed to significantly improve motor recovery or histopathological outcome over the 6 week observational period. Although we cannot conclude that there will be no long-term beneficial effects in other spinal cord injury models using selective P2X7 receptor antagonists at different doses or treatment durations, we caution researchers that this potentially exciting therapy requires further preclinical investigations before the implementation of clinical trials targeting severe SCI patients.

In the present study, common marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group). In the control group, phosphate-buffered saline was injected instead of cells. In the presence of a low-dose of tacrolimus, several grafted cells survived without tumorigenicity and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Significant differences were found in the transverse areas of luxol fast blue-positive myelin sheaths, neurofilament-positive axons, corticospinal tract fibers, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive vessels at the lesion epicenter between the transplantation and control groups. Immunoelectron microscopic examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control group. In addition, a mixed-lymphocyte reaction assay indicated that ESC-NS/PCs modulated the allogeneic immune rejection.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) contributes to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage and macrophage activation in neurotrauma. Further, NOX and ROS increase with central nervous system age. Here, we found significantly higher ROS generation in 14 versus 4-month-old (MO) mice after contusion SCI. Notably, NOX2 increased in 14 MO ROS-producing macrophages suggesting that macrophages and NOX contribute to SCI oxidative stress. Indicators of lipid peroxidation, a downstream cytotoxic effect of ROS accumulation, were significantly higher in 14 versus 4 MO SCI mice. We also detected a higher percentage of ROS-producing M2 (Arginase-1-positive) macrophages in 14 versus 4 MO mice, a previously unreported SCI phenotype, and increased M1 (CD16/32-positive) macrophages with age.

We previously demonstrated that injury-induced upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) restricts the survival, migration, integration, and differentiation of NPCs following SCI. CSPGs are long-lasting components of the astroglial scar that are formed around the lesion. Our recent in vivo studies demonstrated that removing CSPGs from the SCI environment enhances the potential of transplanted and endogenous adult NPCs for spinal cord repair; however, the mechanisms by which CSPGs regulate NPCs remain unclear. In this study, using in vitro models recapitulating the extracellular matrix of SCI, we investigated the direct role of CSPGs in modulating the properties of adult spinal cord NPCs. We show that CSPGs significantly decrease NPCs growth, attachment, survival, proliferation, and oligodendrocytes differentiation. Moreover, using genetic models, we show that CSPGs regulate NPCs by signaling on receptor protein tyrosine phosphate sigma (RPTP sigma) and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase (LAR). Intracellularly, CSPGs inhibitory effects are mediated through Rho/ROCK pathway and inhibition of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Downregulation of RPTP sigma and LAR and blockade of ROCK in NPCs attenuates the inhibitory effects of CSPGS. Our work provide novel evidence uncovering how upregulation of CSPGs challenges the response of NPCs in their post-SCI niche and identifies new therapeutic targets for enhancing NPC-based therapies for SCI repair."

Stem cell-based therapy for repair and replacement of lost neural cells is a promising treatment for central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

The authors examined whether transplanted neurally induced human MSCs (NI hMSCs), developed by a new procedure, can survive, differentiate, and promote tissue protection and functional recovery in injured spinal cord (ISC) rats. Methods. Neural induction was achieved by exposing cells simultaneously to inhibitors of DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and pharmacological agents that increased cAMP levels. Three groups of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected immediately rostral and caudal to the midline lesion with phosphate-buffered saline, MSCs, or NI hMSCs, 1 week after a spinal cord impact injury at T-8. Functional outcome was measured using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and thermal sensitivity test on a weekly basis up to 12 weeks postinjury. Graft integration and anatomy of spinal cord was assessed by stereological, histochemical, and immunohistochemical techniques. Results. The transplanted NI hMSCs survived, differentiated, and significantly improved locomotor recovery of ISC rats. Transplantation also reduced the volume of lesion cavity and white matter loss. Conclusion. This method of hMSC modification may provide an alternative source of autologous adult stem cells for CNS repair."

To apply S1P receptor modulation to the treatment of SCI, we examined the therapeutic effects of FTY720, an S1P receptor agonist, on locomotor recovery after SCI in mice. Oral administration of FTY720 shortly after contusion SCI significantly improved motor function recovery, as assessed by both Basso Mouse Scale scores and Rotarod Performance test results. FTY720 induced lymphopenia and reduced T-cell infiltration in the spinal cord after SCI but did not affect the early infiltration of neutrophils and the activation of microglia. In addition, plasma levels and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord after SCI were not attenuated by FTY720. Vascular permeability and astrocyte accumulation were both decreased by FTY720 in the injured spinal cord. The therapeutic effects of FTY720 were not solely dependent on immune modulation, as confirmed by the demonstration that FTY720 also ameliorated motor function after SCI in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency.

Eight-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice received a mild (30 kilodyne), moderate (50 kilodyne), or severe (70 kilodyne) contusion: injury at the T9 vertebral level. Uninjured control mice received a T9 laminectomy only. Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) open-field locomotor rating scales. Next, 4% paraformaldehyde-perfused spinal cords were collected between the T6 and T12 spinal roots, and stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 degrees C until MRI analysis. MRI lesion volumes were determined using T1-weighted images on a 7-Tesla MRI. Histology was performed on 20-mu m polyester wax-embedded sections processed from the same spinal cords for stereological determination of fibronectin lesion volume and myelin basic protein spared white matter volume. Area of spared white matter at the epicenter was also analyzed. The results demonstrated that the IH Impactor produced precise, graded contusion SCI in mice. Lesion volumes were positively correlated with force of impact, and negatively correlated with spared white matter and functional recovery. Additionally, similar lesion volumes were detected using fibronectin staining and MRI analysis, although MRI may be more sensitive for milder injuries. These results give researchers more options in how to analyze spinal cord injuries in animal models."

SCI was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing an aneurysm clip extradurally for 60 s at T10. The rats received treatment with either vehicle (SCI control) or chrysin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) for 28 days. The various behavioral, biochemical and molecular parameters were determined. Chronic treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently (P < 0.05) attenuated the decrease in body weight, urine output, footprint analysis, sperm count and organ weight (testis, seminal vesicle and urinary bladder). It significantly improved (P < 0.05) the nociceptive threshold, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity. The decreased activity of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and membrane-bound inorganic phosphate were significantly (P < 0.05) restored by chrysin treatment. SCI resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in lipid peroxidase, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and bax whereas expression of bcl-2 and caspase-3 were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced. These changes were significantly reduced by treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg, P < 0.05). Histological aberration induced after SCI in spinal cord, testis, kidney and urinary bladder were restored by treatment with chrysin (20 and 40 mg/kg). In conclusion, chrysin is a potential flavone-possessing antioxidant and its antiapoptotic property caused the subsequent recovery of both motor and sensory functions via modulation of endogenous biomarkers and neuronal apoptosis to inhibit the incidence of neurological deficits due to SCI."

After cervical SCI in adult rats, a peripheral nerve graft was attached to the rostral wall of the lesion cavity. The animals were treated by local application into the cavity of Gelfoam soaked in (1) phosphate buffered saline (untreated controls) or (2) a mixture of the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) (local treatment), or by intrathecal infusion of BDNF + NT-3 for (3) 2 weeks (short-term treatment) or (4) 5-8 weeks (long-term treatment). Despite a very strong survival effect, long-term treatment failed to stimulate ingrowth of descending tracts into the nerve graft, In comparison with untreated controls, the latter treatment also caused 35% reduction in axonal sprouting of descending pathways rostral to the lesion site and 72% reduction in the number of spinal cord neurons extending axons into the nerve graft. Local and short-term treatments neither prevented retrograde cell death nor enhanced regeneration of descending tracts, but induced robust regeneration of spinal cord neurons into the nerve graft. These results indicate that the signal pathways promoting neuronal survival and axonal regeneration, respectively, in descending tracts after SCI respond differently to neurotrophic stimuli and that efficient rescue of axotomized tract neurons is not a sufficient prerequisite for regeneration.

This investigation was undertaken to find out whether a combination of select neurotrophins (BDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor [GDNF], neurotrophin 3 [NT-3], or nerve growth factor [NGF]) will further enhance the neuroprotective efficacy of growth factors in SCI The neurotrophins (0.1-1 mu g/10 mu L in phosphate-buffered saline) were applied 30,60, or 90 min after injury topically over the traumatized spinal cord either alone or in combination. The SCI was performed by making a unilateral incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-T11 segment under Equithesin anesthesia. The rats were allowed to survive 5 h after trauma. Topical application of BDNF, GDNF, or NGF 30 min after SCI in high concentration (0.5 mu g and 1 mu g) significantly improved the motor functions and reduced the BSCB breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury seen at 5 h. These beneficial effects of neurotropins were absent when administered separately either 60 or 90 min after SCL However, a combination of BDNF and GDNF (but not with NT-3 or NGF) given either 60 or 90 min after SCI significantly reduced the motor dysfunction and spinal cord pathology at 5 h.

Several proteins associated with this degenerating myelin are inhibitory to axon growth and therefore prevent severed axons from regenerating. Inflammatory agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can stimulate both the migration and phagocytic activity of macrophages. Using in situ hybridization, we found that the expression of the LPS membrane receptor, CD14, was enhanced in the mouse dorsal column following a dorsal hemisection. Double labeling studies showed that microglia and macrophages are the two major cell types expressing CD14 mRNA following spinal cord injury (SCI). We therefore tested whether systemic injections of LPS would increase the number and phagocytic activity of macrophages/microglia in the ascending sensory tract (AST) of the mouse dorsal column following a dorsal hemisection. Mice were treated daily via intraperitoneal injections of either LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 7 days post-SCI, greater numbers of activated mononuclear phagocytes were present in the AST undergoing Wallerian degeneration (WD) in LPS-treated animals compared with controls. Animals treated with LPS also exhibited greater Oil Red O staining, which is specific for degenerating myelin and macrophages phagocytosing myelin debris. Myelin clearance was confirmed at 7 days using Luxol Fast Blue staining and on toluidine blue-stained semi-thin sections. These results indicate that it is possible to manipulate the innate immune response to accelerate myelin clearance during WD in the injured mouse spinal cord. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Previous studies have reported that scaffold or cell-based transplantation may improve functional recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI), but these results were based on neuronal regeneration and cell replacement. In this study, we investigated whether a combination of Matrigel and neural-induced mesenchymal stem cells (NMSC) improved hindlimb function in dogs with SCI, and what mechanisms were involved. Methods. We pre-differentiated canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into NMSC. A total of 12 dogs subjected to SCI procedures were assigned to one of the following three transplantation treatment groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Matrigel; or Matrigel seeded with NMSC. Treatment occurred 1 week after SCI. Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (B. B. B.) and Tarlov scores, histopathology, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate the treatment effects. Results. Compared with dogs administered PBS or Matrigel alone, dogs treated with Matrigel + NMSC showed significantly better functional recovery 8 weeks after transplantation. Histology and immunochemical analysis revealed that the combination of Matrigel + NMSC reduced fibrosis from secondary injury processes and improved neuronal regeneration more than the other treatments. In addition, the combination of Matrigel + NMSC decreased the expression of inflammation and/or astrogliosis markers. Increased expressions of intracellular molecules related to neuronal extension, neuronal markers and neurotrophic factors were also found in the Matrigel + NMSC group. However, the expression of nestin as a neural stem cell marker was increased with Matrigel alone. Conclusions. The combination of Matrigel + NMSC produced beneficial effects in dogs with regard to functional recovery following SCI through enhancement of anti-inflammation, anti-astrogliosis, neuronal extension and neuronal regeneration effects."

We made a soluble chimeric dimer by linking mouse L1 to human Fc. This L1-Fc construct (40 mug/mL) markedly facilitated neurite outgrowth, as well as neuronal adhesion to white matter on frozen sections of spinal cord. We applied L1-Fc intrathecally (200 mug/mL at 0.5 muL/h) to rat spinal cords for 2 weeks after a 25-mm weight drop contusion of the T13 spinal cord. Initial experiments indicated that L1-Fc is present in the spinal cord after 2 weeks of intrathecal infusion and significantly improved locomotor recovery by 6-12 weeks after injury. We then randomized 45 rats to intrathecal infusion of L1-Fc (L1), phosphate-buffered saline controls (PBS), and a mouse monoclonal IgM antibody (M1). By 12 weeks after injury, L1-treated rats recovered significantly (p < 0.005) better locomotor function (BBB score 10.57 +/- 0.25, n = 14) than PBS-treated rats (BBB score 9.00 +/- 0.33, n = 14) or M1-treated (BBB score 8.71 +/- 0.16, n = 14). Only two rats of 22 treated with saline recovered weight-supported ambulation. Of 20 L1-Fc-treated rats, however, 18 recovered weight-supported walking by 12 weeks. The L1-Fc-treated rats also showed more consistent hindlimb contact placing than saline controls. We injected biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the motor cortices of 14 rats treated with L1-Fc to label corticospinal axons, comparing these with 13 rats treated with saline. In saline-treated rats, BDA-labeled corticospinal axons often grew up to the impact edge and occasionally into the impact site. L1-treated rats showed longer corticospinal tract growth at the injury site. Three rats had BDA-labeled axons that extended beyond the impact center. One L1-Fc-treated rat showed axonal extension and synapse formation in cord distal to the injury. These results indicate that soluble L1-Fc promotes axonal growth and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. However, the limited corticospinal tract growth across the injury site cannot account for the observed locomotor recovery. Thus, L1 may be stimulating growth of other motor tracts or protecting axons and neurons. More studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of L1-Fc-induced locomotor recovery."

Anti-inflammatory treatment of human SCI and its timing must be based on knowledge of the types of cells participating in the inflammatory response, the time after injury when they appear and then decrease in number, and the nature of their actions. Using post-mortem spinal cords, we evaluated the time course and distribution of pathological change, infiltrating neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, and microglial activation in injured spinal cords from patients who were 'dead at the scene' or who survived for intervals up to 1 year after SCI. SCI caused zones of pathological change, including areas of inflammation and necrosis in the acute cases, and cystic cavities with longer survival (Zone 1), mantles of less severe change, including axonal swellings, inflammation and Wallerian degeneration (Zone 2) and histologically intact areas (Zone 3). Zone 1 areas increased in size with time after injury whereas the overall injury (size of the Zones 1 and 2 combined) remained relatively constant from the time (1-3 days) when damage was first visible. The distribution of inflammatory cells correlated well with the location of Zone 1, and sometimes of Zone 2. Neutrophils, visualized by their expression of human neutrophil alpha-defensins (defensin), entered the spinal cord by haemorrhage or extravasation, were most numerous 1-3 days after SCI, and were detectable for up to 10 days after SCI. Significant numbers of activated CD68-immunoreactive ramified microglia and a few monocytes/macrophages were in injured tissue within 1-3 days of SCI. Activated microglia, a few monocytes/macrophages and numerous phagocytic macrophages were present for weeks to months after SCI. A few CD8(+) lymphocytes were in the injured cords throughout the sampling intervals. Expression by the inflammatory cells of the oxidative enzymes myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (gp91(phox)), and of the pro-inflammatory matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, was analysed to determine their potential to cause oxidative and proteolytic damage. Oxidative activity, inferred from MPO and gp91(phox) immunoreactivity, was primarily associated with neutrophils and activated microglia. Phagocytic macrophages had weak or no expression of MPO or gp91(phox). Only neutrophils expressed MMP-9. These data indicate that potentially destructive neutrophils and activated microglia, replete with oxidative and proteolytic enzymes, appear within the first few days of SCI, suggesting that anti-inflammatory 'neuroprotective' strategies should be directed at preventing early neutrophil influx and modifying microglial activation."

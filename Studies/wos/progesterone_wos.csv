Interestingly, it has been reported that FK506 increases neurite outgrowth in cell cultures, implying a potential impact in putative treatments of neurodegenerative disorders and injuries of the nervous system. Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of this compound is poorly understood and remains to be elucidated, with the only certainty that its neurotrophic effect is independent of its primary immunosuppressant activity. In this study it is demonstrated that FK506 shows efficient neurotrophic action in vitro and profound effects on the recovery of locomotor activity, behavioural features, and erectile function of mice that underwent surgical spinal cord injury. The recovery of the locomotor activity was studied in knock-out mice for either immunophilin, FKBP51 or FKBP52. The experimental evidence demonstrates that the neurotrophic actions of FK506 are the consequence of its binding to FKBP52, whereas FK506 interaction with the close-related partner immunophilin FKBP51 antagonises the function of FKBP52. Importantly, our study also demonstrates that other immunophilins do not replace FKBP52. It is concluded that the final biological response is the resulting outcome of the drug binding to both immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, the latter being the one that commands the dominant neurotrophic action in vivo."

In experimental animal models, however, many studies used females. Funding agencies like the National Institutes of Health recommend that new proposed studies should include both genders due to variations in gender response to injuries, diseases, and treatments. However, cost and considerations for some animal models, such as SCI, affect investigators in adapting to this recommendation. Research has increased comparing gender effects in various disease and injury models, including SCI. However, most studies use weight-matched animals, which poses issues in comparing results and outcomes. The present study compared histologic and functional outcomes between age-matched male and female Sprague-Dawley rats in a moderate thoracic contusion SCI model. Cresyl violet and eosin staining showed no significant differences in lesion volume between genders after 9 weeks post-SCI (p > 0.05). Luxol fast blue-stained spared myelin was similar between genders, although slightly greater (similar to 6%) in spared myelin, compared with cord volume (p = 0.044). Glial reactivity and macrophage labeling in the lesion area was comparable between genders, as well. Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) functional scores were not significantly different between genders, and Hargreaves thermal hyperalgesia and Gridwalk sensorimotor analyses also were similar between genders, compared with uninjured gender controls. Analysis of covariance showed weight did not influence functional recovery as assessed through BBB (p = 0.65) or Gridwalk assessment (p = 0.63) in this study.

In the current study, we evaluated the roles of E2 administration before SCs transplantation in targeting SCI-induced axonal degeneration and demyelination. E2 (25 mu g/kg, IP) was administered to the male Wistar rats underwent contusive SCI at T10 segment.

Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso-Bresnahan-Beattie locomotor test. Sections from spinal cord were also assessed for histoloical staining, including Luxol fast blue, Bielschowsky's silver and immunofluorescence evaluation of myelin basic protein (MBP). The SCI group showed impaired locomotion in the hind limb, increased number of cavities within spinal cord, low observable numbers of regenerating fibers, and a significant decrease in the rate of expression for MBP.

It was found that each of these hormones, through varied mechanisms, could serve to reduce the harmful effects associated with spinal cord injury, and could aid in restoring some function to the injured spinal cord in the animal models. The most striking effects were seen in the reduction of inflammation commonly linked to injury of the central nervous system.

Here, we investigate the dynamics of injured axons and the effect of PG on the axonal dieback, glial response, and behavioral recovery in a mouse model of SCI. Two-photon intravital imaging combined with a simplified imaging window chamber were used to image axons in hemisected spinal cords over a period of 3 days. Repeated imaging showed that axonal dieback distance in mice treated with PG after SCI was significantly reduced than that in mice treated with vehicle after SCI (P < 0.05) at the time point of 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after SCI. The densities of astrocytes and microglia in the SCI-vehicle treated group were significantly higher than those in mice treated with PG after SCI (P < 0.05). Real time polymerase chain reaction assay indicated that administration of PG after SCI down regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, NOS2, and IL-1 beta (P < 0.05). PG treatment also improved the behavioral performance post injury. These findings suggested that PG exerted a neuroprotective effect by attenuating axonal dieback, reducing the accumulation of astrocytes and microglia and inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Past experimental and clinical research aimed at addressing this subject has led to constrasting findings on whether females hold any advantage in locomotor recovery. Additionally, for studies supporting the notion of a female gender related advantage, a definite cause has not been explained. In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance. age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male. By deepening our understanding of why a gender advantage exists, potential new therapeutics can be designed to improve recovery for the male population following the initial trauma or putatively augment the neuroprotective privilege in females for enhanced outcomes."

Vehicle or PROG (4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) was daily applied over 13 days after unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the dorsal striatum of male rats. Turning behavior, foot slips on a horizontal grid, and forelimb use during rearing in a cylinder were observed on days 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, and 14 postlesion, and then the brain samples were analyzed by HPLC-EC. Chronic 8 mg/kg of PROG administration increased the DOPAC/dopamine (DA) ratio in the lesioned striatum, ipsiversive turnings, and the number of hind limb slips and decreased the symmetrical use of forelimbs. Thus, contrary to hypothesis, the chronic treatment with PROG exasperated rather than alleviated the motor impairments in the hemiparkinsonian rats. Because previous studies with the MPTP model had shown protective effects when PROG treatment was administrated before the lesion, our results do not rule out such potential neuroprotective action with prelesion PROG treatment.

Immunoreactivity to Nogo-A, Ng-R, and Rho-A was evaluated at 24 h, 72 h or 7 d, or at 14 d of reperfusion after rats were tested in the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Global cerebral ischemia induced an increase in Nogo-A, Ng-R, and Rho-A immunoreactivities in the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons at 24 h after global cerebral ischemia, peaking at 72 h, and persisting 14 d later. In addition, at 72 h, a strong immunoreactivity was observed in the hippocampal layers where dendritic arborizations of C.A1 pyramidal neurons are located.

Here, we describe a model to evaluate degeneration of the ascending sensory projections to the nuclei in the medulla following graded spinal cord contusions in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Cholera toxin B (CTB) labeling from the sciatic nerve of naive rats revealed effective labeling of the terminal fibers in the gracile nucleus at 3 days post-injection and a subpopulation of rapidly transporting fibers after 1 day. Seven days after contusions using the Infinite Horizon impactor the area of CTB-labeled terminal fibers had a negative correlation with increasing impact force. Moderate spinal contusions of around 150 kilodyne (kdyn or 0.15 x 10(-3) newton) caused a reduction to 40% in the fiber area which will enable the identification of protective as well as detrimental drugs and post-injury mechanisms. A preconditioning injury of the sciatic nerve reportedly can enhance growth of sensory axons but did not affect the terminal fiber area in the gracile nucleus. Estrogen and progesterone are protective in various systems and could therefore influence experimental outcomes when using females. However, the phase of the estrus cycle at the time of contusion or during the post-injury time did not affect the outcome of the contusion, indicating that female rats may be used without consideration of the estrus cycle.

Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D (VD) has neuroprotective actions and can promote function recovery after TBI. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that autophagy could be enhanced following supplementation with an active metabolite of VD (calcitriol). However, it is unclear whether autophagy participates in the protective effects of calcitriol after TBI. To test this hypothesis, we examined the protective effects of calcitriol on TBI-induced neurological impairment and further investigated whether calcitriol could modulate autophagy dysfunction-mediated cell death in the cortex region of rat brain. Methods: Eighty-five male rats (250-280 g) were randomly assigned to sham (n = 15), TBI model (TBI, n = 35) and calcitriol treatment (calcitriol, n = 35) groups. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with calcitriol (1 mu g/kg) at 30 min, 24 h and 48 h post-TBI in the calcitriol group. The lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), was used to evaluate autophagic flux in the TBI and calcitriol groups. Neurological functions were evaluated via the modified neurological severity score test at 1-7 days after TBI or sham operation, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated FITC-dUTP nick-end labeling method was used to evaluate the ability of calcitriol to inhibit apoptosis. The expression of VDR, LC3 and p62 proteins was measured by western blot analysis at 1, 3 and 7 days post-injury. Results: Calcitriol treatment attenuated mNSS at 2-7 days post-TBI (P < 0.05 versus TBI group). Calcitriol dramatically increased VDR protein expression compared with the untreated counterparts at 1, 3 and 7 days post-TBI (P < 0.05). The rate of apoptotic cells in calcitriol-treated rats was significantly reduced compared to that observed in the TBI group (P < 0.05). The LC3II/LC3I ratio was decreased in the cortex region at 1, 3 and 7 days post-TBI in rats treated with calcitriol (p < 0.05 versus TBI group), and the p62 expression was also attenuated (p < 0.05 versus TBI group). The LC3II/LC3I ratio in the calcitriol group was significantly increased when pretreated with CQ (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Calcitriol treatment activated VDR protein expression and attenuated neurological deficits in this rat TBI model. The protective effects might be associated with the restoration of autophagy flux and the decrease in apoptosis in the cortex region of rat brain. (C) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

Males with SCI tend to be injured at an earlier age, mostly during sports or motor vehicle accidents, whereas females tend be injured later in life, particularly in the age group 65 and older. In both experimental and clinical studies, the question as to whether gender affects outcome has been addressed in a variety of patient groups and animal models. Results from experimental paradigms have suggested that a gender bias in outcome exists that favors females and appears to involve the advantageous or disadvantageous effects of the gonadal sex hormones estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, respectively. However, other studies have shown an absence of gender differences in outcome in specific SCI models and work has also questioned the involvement of female sex hormones in the observed outcome improvements in females. Similar controversy exists clinically, in studies that have examined gender disparities in outcome after SCI. The current review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for a gender bias in outcome following SCI and discusses issues that have made it difficult to conclusively answer this question."

As such, even routine prehospital administration becomes extremely feasible for a myriad of conditions. More importantly, the worldwide magnitude of potential patients who could benefit is profound. Even if estrogen only changes the outcome in a relatively small percentage of applicable cases, the potential impact may still be of dramatic proportions in terms of the absolute number of lives saved and the resources spared worldwide. Resources may be spared not only in terms of diminishing the economic impact of death and long-term disability, but also in terms of preventing extended intensive care unit stays and treatment of preventable complications that result in longer recovery.

Our assessments indicate that aged and geriatric rats have a delayed Fate of locomotor recovery following contusion SCI as compared to young rats. Additionally, aged and geriatric Fats have significantly slower bladder recovery as compared to Young rats. Examination of myelin pathology reveals that aged and geriatric rats have significantly greater area of pathology and amount of demyelination, as well as significantly less remyelination as compared to Young rats following contusion SCL These data are the first to indicate that there is an age-associated decline in the rate and extent of both locomotor and bladder recovery following contusion SCI, and that age adversely affects the degree of general pathology, demyelination, and remyelination that accompanies contusion SCI.

Evaluating locomotor recovery variances between sexes following a precise, clinically relevant spinal cord contusion model can provide valuable insight into a possible gender-related advantage in outcome post-SCI. In the current study, we hypothesized that by employing larger sample sizes in a reproducible contusive SCI paradigm, subtle distinctions in locomotor recovery between sexes, if they exist, would be elucidated through a broad range of behavioral tests. During 13 weeks of functional assessment after a thoracic (T8) contusive SCI in rat, significant differences owing to gender existed for the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score and CatWalk hindlimb swing, support four, and single stance analyses. Significant differences in locomotor performance were noticeable as early as 4 weeks post-SCI. Stereological tissue-volume analysis determined that females, more so than males, also exhibited greater volumes of preserved gray and white matter within the injured cord segment as well as more spared ventral white matter area at the center of the lesion. The stereological tissue analysis differences favoring females directly correlated with the female rats' greater functional improvement observed at endpoint."

In addition, progesterone increased the number of total mature oligodendrocytes, myelin basic protein immunoreactivity, and the number of axonal profiles at the epicenter of the lesion.

Both neurons and glial cells expressed the classical PROG receptor (PR), suggesting that genomic mechanisms participated in PROG action. In TRX rats, PROG treatment stimulated the number of NADPH-diaphorase (nitric oxide synthase) active astrocytes, whereas the number of astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was stimulated in control but not in TRX rats. PROG also stimulated the immunocytochemical staining for myelin-basic protein (MBP) and the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells expressing the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 in TRX rats. In terms of beneficial or detrimental consequences, these PROG effects may be supportive of neuronal recuperation, as shown for several neuronal functional parameters that were normalized by PROG treatment of spinal cord injured animals. Thus, PROG effects on glial cells go in parallel with morphological and biochemical evidence of survival of damaged motoneurons."

Previous work has demonstrated beneficial effects of PROG in the Wobbler mouse. As an extension of this work, we now studied steroid effects on neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein, on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity (IR) and activity in the spinal cord, and on recovery of muscle atrophy. Wobbler mice received implants of PROG pellets (20 mg) at 6 and 10 weeks of age and were killed at 14 weeks. In situ hybridization for BDNF mRNA demonstrated that grain density in large (> 600 gm(2)) and medium size (< 600 mu m(2)) ventral horn neurons was decreased in untreated Wobblers, whereas PROG treatment increased BDNF mRNA in both neuronal types. PROG also induced a subcellular redistribution of BDNF protein, which in controls and steroid-naive Wobblers showed a predominant perinuclear and nucleolar location, whereas after PROG treatment, it was detected in cytoplasmic aggregates. ChAT activity was reduced by 55.3% in muscles of untreated Wobbler mice, whereas a significant increment was obtained after PROG treatment. Wobblers also showed reduced number of ChAT positive motoneurons, but this number was restored to normal by PROG. Finally, the pronounced biceps atrophy of steroid-naive Wobbler mice was slightly but significantly increased by PROG-treatment. Considering the important role played by neurotrophins on neuronal function, changes in BDNF might be part of the PROG activated-pathways to provide neuroprotection and re-establish neurotransmission and neuromuscular function in this degeneration model.

Similarly, numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone administration is associated with a mortality reduction, improvement in neurological outcomes, and a reduction in neuronal apoptosis after TBI and SCI. Here, we review the evidence that supports hormone-related neuroprotection and discuss possible underlying mechanisms. Estrogen and progesterone-mediated neuroprotection are thought to be related to their effects on hormone receptors, signaling systems, direct antioxidant effects, effects on astrocytes and microglia, modulation of the inflammatory response, effects on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and effects on mediating glutamate excitotoxicity. Future laboratory research is needed to better determine the mechanisms underlying the hormones' neuroprotective effects, which will allow for more clinical studies. Furthermore, large randomized clinical control trials are needed to better assess their role in human neurodegenerative conditions."

Implant of a single progesterone pellet (20 mg) during 15 days produced substantial changes in Wobbler mice spinal cord. Morphologically, motoneurons of untreated Wobbler mice showed severe vacuolation of intracellular organelles including mitochondria. In contrast, neuropathology was less pronounced in Wobbler mice receiving progesterome, together with a reduction of vacuolated cells and preservation of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Determination of mRNAs for the alpha3 and beta1 subunits of neuronal Na, K-ATPase, showed that mRNA levels in untreated mice were significantly reduced, whereas progesterone therapy re-established the expression of both subunits. Additionally, progesterone treatment of Wobbler mice attenuated the aberrant expression of the growth-associated protein (GAP-43) mRNA which otherwise occurred in motoneurons of untreated animals.

Myriad treatment modalities, including corticosteroids, 21-amino-steroids, opioid receptor antagonists, gangliosides, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TRH analogs, antioxidants and free radical scavengers, calcium channel blockers, magnesium replacement therapy, sodium channel blockers, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-kainate receptor antagonists, modulators of arachadonic acid metabolism, neurotrophic growth factors, serotonin antagonists, antibodies against inhibitors of axonal regeneration, potassium channel blockers (4-aminopyridine), paclitaxel, clenbuterol, progesterone, gabexate mesylate, activated protein C, caspase inhibitors, tacrolimus, antibodies against adhesion molecules, and other immunomodulatory therapy have been studied to date. Although most of these agents have shown promise, only one agent, methylprednisolone, has been shown to provide benefit in large clinical trials. Given these data, many individuals consider methylprednisolone to be the standard of care for the treatment of acute SCI. However, this has not been established definitively, and questions pertaining to methodology have emerged regarding the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study trials that provided these conclusions. Additionally, the clinical significance (in contrast to statistical significance) of recovery after methylprednisolone treatment is unclear and must be considered in light of the potential adverse effects of such treatment.

In peripheral neuropathies, progesterone and reduced derivatives promote remyelination, axonal regeneration and the recovery of function. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), progesterone has the ability to reduce edema and inflammatory cytokines, prevent neuronal loss and improve functional outcomes. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury. In experimental spinal cord injury (SCI), molecular markers of functional motoneurons become impaired, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, Na,K-ATPase mRNA, microtubule-associated protein 2 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). SO also produces motoneuron chromatolysis. Progesterone treatment restores the expression of these molecules while chromatolysis subsided. SCI also causes oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination. In this case, a short progesterone treatment enhances proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into mature myelin-producing cells, whereas prolonged treatment increases a transcription factor (Olig1) needed to repair injury-induced demyelination. Progesterone neuroprotection has also been shown in motoneuron neurodegeneration. In Wobbler mice spinal cord, progesterone reverses the impaired expression of BDNF, ChAT and Na,K-ATPase, prevents vacuolar motoneuron degeneration and the development of mitochondrial abnormalities, while functionally increases muscle strength and the survival of Wobbler mice. Multiple mechanisms contribute to these progesterone effects, and the role played by classical nuclear receptors. extra nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, and the reduced metabolites of progesterone in neuroprotection and myelin formation remain an exciting field worth of exploration.

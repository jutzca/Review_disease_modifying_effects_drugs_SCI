Injury activates the stress systems; this in turn may augment the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulate pro-inflammatory immune cells, and alter the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response. As a result, it is suggested that stress pathways may augment neuronal damage and loss after SCI. Considering these potential detrimental effects of stress after SCI, we hypothesized that inhibition of stress pathways immediately after SCI may offer protection from damage and improve recovery. To investigate the relevance of stress responses in SCI recovery, we investigated the effects of blocking three well-studied stress response axes in a mouse model of SCI. Propranolol, RU-486, and CP-99994 were administered to inhibit the sympathetic axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the neuropeptide axis, respectively. Surprisingly, assessing functional recovery by the Basso Mouse Scale revealed that RU-486 and CP-99994 did not affect functional outcome, indicating that these pathways are dispensable for neuroprotection or repair after SCI. Moreover, the beta-blocker propranolol worsened functional outcome in the mouse SCI model. In conclusion, immediate inhibition of three major stress axes has no beneficial effects on functional recovery after SCI in mice. These results suggest that injury-induced stress responses do not interfere with the healing process and hence, pharmacological targeting of stress responses is not a recommended treatment option for SCI. These findings are of great importance for other researchers to avoid unnecessary and potentially futile animal experiments."

This study evaluates the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats (N = 147) were fasted for 16 h and had the left jugular vein cannulated followed by laminectomy or laminectomy + complete SCT between T-4 and T-5 vertebrae. The next day, a test meal (1.5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0.5 mg/ml in 5% glucose) was administered by gavage feeding and 10 min later cervical dislocation was performed. Dye recovery in the stomach, and proximal, mid and distal small intestine was determined by spectrophotometry. SCT inhibited GE and GI transit since it increased gastric recovery by 71.3% and decreased mid small intestine recovery by 100% (P < 0.05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, celiac ganglionectomy + section of the splanchnic nerves, i.v. hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) prevented the development of the SCT effect on GE and GI transit. Pretreatment with i.v. naloxone (3, mg/kg), L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was ineffective. Bilateral adrenalectomy or guanethidine (10 mg/kg) increased the magnitude of the GE inhibition, while i.v. prazosin (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.5 mg/kg) decreased the magnitude but did not abolish the GE inhibition. In summary, the inhibition of GI motility observed 1 day after thoracic SCT in awake rats seems to involve vagal and possibly splanchnic pathways. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

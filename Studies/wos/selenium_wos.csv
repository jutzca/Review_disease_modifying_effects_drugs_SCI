It appears to contribute to the death of tumors, ischemia-reperfusion, acute renal failure, and nervous system diseases, among others. The generative mechanism of ferroptosis includes iron overloading, lipid peroxidation, and downstream execution, while the regulatory mechanism involves the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, as well as the mevalonate pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. In-depth research has continuously developed and enriched knowledge on the mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs. In recent years, reports of the noninterchangeable role played by selenium in glutathione peroxidase 4 and its function in suppressing ferroptosis and the discovery of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, identified as a ferroptosis resistance factor parallel to the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, have expanded and deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which ferroptosis works. Ferroptosis has been reported in spinal cord injury animal model experiments, and the inhibition of ferroptosis could promote the recovery of neurological function. Here, we review the latest studies on mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs, focusing on the ferroptosis execution and the contents related to selenium and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. In addition, we summarize the current research status of ferroptosis in spinal cord injury. The aim of this review is to better understand the mechanisms by which ferroptosis occurs and its role in the pathophysiological process of spinal cord injury, so as to provide a new idea and frame of reference for further exploration."

Because of the critical role of the antioxidant system in responding to traumatic events, we hypothesized that dietary selenium supplementation would enhance neuroprotection in a rodent model of spinal cord injury. Rats were maintained on either a control or selenium-enriched diet prior to, and following, injury. Dietary selenium supplementation, provided as selenized yeast added to normal rat chow, resulted in a doubling of selenium levels in the spinal cord. Dietary selenium reduced the time required for recovery of bladder function following thoracic spinal cord injury. However, this was not accompanied by improvement in locomotor function or tissue sparing."

Prior to the creation of the lesion, we inserted an EMG recording device to facilitate measurement of tail movement and muscle activity before and after TSCI. This model is unique in that the impairment is limited to the tail: the subjects do not experience limb weakness, bladder impairment, or bowel dysfunction. In addition, 4 of the 6 subjects received a combination treatment comprising thyrotropin releasing hormone, selenium, and vitamin E after induction of experimental TSCI. The subjects tolerated the implantation of the recording device and did not experience adverse effects due the medications administered. The EMG data were transformed into a metric of volitional tail moment, which appeared to be valid measure of initial impairment and subsequent natural or treatment-related recovery. The histopathologic assessment demonstrated widespread axon loss at the site of injury and areas cephalad and caudad. Histopathology revealed evidence of continuing inflammation, with macrophage activation. The EMG data did not demonstrate evidence of a statistically significant treatment effect."

The existing literature contains no studies on the effects of various doses of aspirin on spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, we sought to investigate the putative effects of aspirin on experimental SCI. The weight-drop injury model was used to produce SCI in 100 albino Wistar rats. The animals were allocated to five groups: a control group, where the rats did not undergo any surgical or medical intervention except for anesthesia; a sham-treated group, where laminectomy was performed without SCI and no further therapy was administered; and three other groups, where the rats with SCI received low-dose aspirin [20 mg/kg], high-dose aspirin [80 mg/kg], and a vehicle, respectively. Half of the rats were sacrificed 24 hours later, and their spinal cords were excised for biochemical studies. The other rats were subjected to Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale scoring once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. Aspirin decreased lipid peroxidation following SCI as the mean (+/- standard error) catalase level was significantly higher in the high-dose aspirin group (46.10 +/- 12.01) than in the sham-treated group (16.07 +/- 2.42) and the vehicle-treated group (15.31 +/- 3.20) (P<0.05; P<0.05, respectively). Both of the groups treated with high-dose and low-dose aspirin demonstrated a higher mean BBB score than did the control group (P<0.001) and the sham-treated group (P<0.001). Our data provide evidence in support of the potential effects of aspirin in biochemical and neurobehavioral recovery after SCI."

Among the complex pathophysiological events following SCI, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction plays a particularly significant role. As therapeutic agents for neurological diseases, tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) have been widely used in the clinical treatment of SCI. Our previous studies have reported that functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) exhibit excellent antioxidant activity against oxidative stress-related diseases. Therefore, in this study, novel multifunctionalized SeNPs decorated with polysaccharideprotein complex (PTW)/PG-6 peptide and loaded with TMP/GM1 were rationally designed and synthesized, which exhibited a satisfactory size distribution and superior stability. Furthermore, the protective effects of SeNPs@GM1/TMP on PC12 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH)-induced cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms were also explored. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that SeNPs@GM1/TMP showed strongly protective effects against t-BOOH-induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we found that SeNPs@GM1/TMP could attenuate ROS overproduction to prevent mitochondria dysfunction via inhibiting the activation of p53 and MAPK pathways. Effects of SeNPs@GM1/TMP on functional recovery after SCI were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale, inclined plane test, and footprint analysis. The results of hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining also showed that SeNPs@GM1/TMP provided a neuroprotective effect in SCI rats. This finding suggests that SeNPs@GM1/TMP could be further developed as a promising nanomedicine for efficient SCI treatment."

Sodium selenite treatment exerted a profound preventive effect on apoptotic cell death, including p-P38, pSAPK/JNK, caspases, and PARP activity, and ameliorated astrogliosis and hypomyelination, which occurs in regions of active cell death in the spinal cords of SCI rats. The foremost protective effect of selenite in SCI would therefore be manifested in the suppression of acute secondary apoptotic cell death. However, selenite does not appear to exert an anti-inflammatory function associated with active microglia and macrophage propagation or infiltration into the lesion site. Selenite-mediated neuroprotection has been linked to selenite's attenuation or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, pSAPK/JNK, and Bax activation in in vitro and in vivo SCI lesion sites. Selenite also attenuated cell death via the prevention of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and ROS accumulation in the cytosol. Also, our study showed that selenite administered immediately after SCI significantly diminishes functional deficits. The selenite-treated group recovered hind limb reflexes more rapidly, and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses to a greater degree than was seen in the untreated injured rats. Our data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of selenite is most likely the consequence of its comprehensive apoptotic cell death blocking effects, resulting in the protection of white matter, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and the inhibition of astrogliosis. The finding that the administration of selenite prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic spinal cord injuries, and promotes the recovery of motor function in an animal model. Its efficacy may facilitate the development of novel drug targets for the treatment of SCI. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel."
